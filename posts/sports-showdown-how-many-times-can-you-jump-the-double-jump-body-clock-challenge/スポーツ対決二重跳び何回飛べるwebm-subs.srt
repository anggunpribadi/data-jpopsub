1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,000
Next, we will do a 10 second challenge!

2
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:13,000
You will be given a time limit.

3
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:22,000
The person who can do it in 10 seconds
will be the winner!

4
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:24,000
This is hard.

5
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000
I've seen this on TV.

6
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,176
I'm not confident.

7
00:00:28,176 --> 00:00:30,176
I'm confident.

8
00:00:30,176 --> 00:00:32,176
I'm glad.

9
00:00:32,176 --> 00:00:34,176
I'm looking forward to it.

10
00:00:34,176 --> 00:00:36,176
I'm confident.

11
00:00:38,176 --> 00:00:40,176
Let's get started.

12
00:00:40,176 --> 00:00:42,176
Let's get started.

13
00:00:42,176 --> 00:00:44,400
I'm looking forward to it.

14
00:00:44,400 --> 00:00:48,400
Let's start the challenge.

15
00:00:49,400 --> 00:00:51,400
I can't see the time.

16
00:00:51,400 --> 00:00:53,400
I'm wearing a mask.

17
00:00:53,400 --> 00:00:58,400
I'm wearing a mask.

18
00:00:58,400 --> 00:01:00,400
I can't see the time.

19
00:01:00,400 --> 00:01:02,400
I'm wearing a mask.

20
00:01:02,400 --> 00:01:04,400
I can't see the time.

21
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:08,400
I'll be the one who knows the time
later.

22
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:13,392
Please start the challenge at the right
timing.

23
00:01:13,392 --> 00:01:15,392
Let's start!

24
00:01:15,392 --> 00:01:30,458
Start!

25
00:01:30,458 --> 00:01:41,458
I'm scared. I don't know what to do.

26
00:01:41,458 --> 00:01:43,458
Please do it.

27
00:01:43,458 --> 00:01:45,458
I'm nervous.

28
00:01:47,458 --> 00:01:48,458
I'm nervous.

29
00:01:48,458 --> 00:01:51,458
Let's start.

30
00:01:51,458 --> 00:01:54,458
Ready, start!

31
00:01:54,458 --> 00:02:02,458
Start!

32
00:02:02,618 --> 00:02:04,618
I got it.

33
00:02:04,618 --> 00:02:06,618
What?

34
00:02:08,618 --> 00:02:10,618
I don't know.

35
00:02:12,618 --> 00:02:14,618
Maybe this is right.

36
00:02:20,618 --> 00:02:22,618
Next.

37
00:02:22,618 --> 00:02:24,618
One.

38
00:02:24,618 --> 00:02:26,618
Are you ready?

39
00:02:26,618 --> 00:02:28,618
Yes.

40
00:02:28,618 --> 00:02:30,618
I'll do my best.

41
00:02:30,618 --> 00:02:32,618
I'll do my best.

42
00:02:44,474 --> 00:02:46,474
I chose you.

43
00:02:46,474 --> 00:02:48,474
You are making a serious face.

44
00:02:48,474 --> 00:02:50,474
I wonder how it would be.

45
00:02:50,474 --> 00:02:52,474
I think it was too early.

46
00:02:52,474 --> 00:02:54,474
Everyone was late.

47
00:02:54,474 --> 00:02:56,474
I wonder how it would be.

48
00:02:56,474 --> 00:02:58,474
I will choose you.

49
00:02:58,474 --> 00:03:00,474
I will choose you.

50
00:03:00,474 --> 00:03:02,474
I will choose you.

51
00:03:02,474 --> 00:03:12,890
I will choose you.

52
00:03:12,890 --> 00:03:16,890
Please give us your opinion.

53
00:03:16,890 --> 00:03:18,890
I don't know.

54
00:03:18,890 --> 00:03:20,890
I don't know what it is.

55
00:03:20,890 --> 00:03:22,890
Please tell us when you are in the 10th
grade.

56
00:03:22,890 --> 00:03:24,890
I don't know.

57
00:03:24,890 --> 00:03:28,890
I can't get the feeling of the silver
button.

58
00:03:28,890 --> 00:03:31,942
I'm sorry.

59
00:03:31,942 --> 00:03:33,942
I can't do it.

60
00:03:34,942 --> 00:03:36,942
I'm sorry.

61
00:03:36,942 --> 00:03:40,942
I'm sorry.

62
00:03:56,942 --> 00:04:00,942
I've never felt this time in my life.

63
00:04:01,942 --> 00:04:02,942
Last one?

64
00:04:02,942 --> 00:04:05,942
I'm tired of it.

65
00:04:07,130 --> 00:04:09,130
I'm confident in my ability.

66
00:04:09,130 --> 00:04:11,130
You said you were confident.

67
00:04:11,130 --> 00:04:13,130
I'm not.

68
00:04:13,130 --> 00:04:15,130
How about this?

69
00:04:15,130 --> 00:04:17,130
I'm not confident.

70
00:04:17,130 --> 00:04:19,130
I'm going to start.

71
00:04:19,130 --> 00:04:34,682
I'm going to start.

72
00:04:34,682 --> 00:04:38,682
I'm a little confused.

73
00:04:38,682 --> 00:04:40,682
I think it's good.

74
00:04:42,682 --> 00:04:44,682
What do you think?

75
00:04:44,682 --> 00:04:46,682
The result is...

76
00:04:46,682 --> 00:04:51,682
I will announce the result.

77
00:04:51,682 --> 00:04:53,682
The result is...

78
00:04:53,682 --> 00:04:56,682
I don't know the answer at all.

79
00:04:56,682 --> 00:04:58,682
Can I announce it?

80
00:04:58,682 --> 00:05:00,682
Kanamin will announce it in order.

81
00:05:00,682 --> 00:05:03,024
Please announce it.

82
00:05:03,024 --> 00:05:06,024
Kanamin 10.90 seconds.

83
00:05:06,024 --> 00:05:08,024
Wow!

84
00:05:08,024 --> 00:05:09,024
I'm surprised.

85
00:05:09,024 --> 00:05:13,024
Julia 7.9 seconds.

86
00:05:13,024 --> 00:05:15,024
Wow!

87
00:05:15,024 --> 00:05:19,024
Toka 9.65 seconds.

88
00:05:19,024 --> 00:05:21,024
That's close.

89
00:05:21,024 --> 00:05:25,024
Okaru 11.12 seconds.

90
00:05:25,024 --> 00:05:26,024
That's close.

91
00:05:26,024 --> 00:05:29,024
Aki 12.79 seconds.

92
00:05:29,024 --> 00:05:30,768
That's close.

93
00:05:30,768 --> 00:05:33,768
Aki 11.10 seconds.

94
00:05:33,768 --> 00:05:35,768
So, it's Hito-chan?

95
00:05:35,768 --> 00:05:38,768
It's Hito-chan!

96
00:05:38,768 --> 00:05:40,768
It's Hito-chan!

97
00:05:40,768 --> 00:05:42,768
Yay!

98
00:05:42,768 --> 00:05:44,768
Wow!

99
00:05:44,768 --> 00:05:46,768
That was pretty slow.

100
00:05:46,768 --> 00:05:48,218
That was pretty slow.

101
00:05:48,218 --> 00:05:50,218
Wow, you're so confident!

102
00:05:50,218 --> 00:05:52,218
You're so slow!

103
00:05:52,218 --> 00:05:54,218
I thought I was about to get the first
place.

104
00:05:54,218 --> 00:05:57,218
I thought Aki-chan's vote was slow.

105
00:05:57,218 --> 00:05:59,218
Aki-chan's was 12 seconds, so I was
about to get the first place.

106
00:05:59,218 --> 00:06:02,218
No way! I was about the same as Aki-
chan.

107
00:06:02,218 --> 00:06:03,218
I don't know.

108
00:06:03,218 --> 00:06:05,218
You're so slow.

109
00:06:05,218 --> 00:06:06,218
Yay!

110
00:06:06,218 --> 00:06:07,218
You're so fast!

111
00:06:07,218 --> 00:06:09,722
I was the first place when I did it
before.

112
00:06:09,722 --> 00:06:19,722
I thought it was 30 minutes, but it was
15 minutes.

113
00:06:19,722 --> 00:06:21,722
I'm confident.

114
00:06:21,722 --> 00:06:23,722
I'm confident.

115
00:06:25,722 --> 00:06:27,722
So, the winner is Hito.

116
00:06:27,722 --> 00:06:29,722
Yay!

117
00:06:29,722 --> 00:06:33,626
The winner is...

118
00:06:33,626 --> 00:06:35,626
Which one?

119
00:06:35,626 --> 00:06:37,626
The last one is Julia.

120
00:06:37,626 --> 00:06:39,626
It's Julia, right?

121
00:06:39,626 --> 00:06:41,626
Isn't it Julia?

122
00:06:41,626 --> 00:06:43,626
Isn't it?

123
00:06:43,626 --> 00:06:45,626
2.1

124
00:06:45,626 --> 00:06:47,626
2.76 is Aki.

125
00:06:47,626 --> 00:06:49,626
Aki?

126
00:06:49,626 --> 00:06:51,626
Aki?

127
00:06:51,626 --> 00:06:53,626
Aki?

128
00:06:53,626 --> 00:06:57,050
It's a little early, so I was wondering
if it was funny.

129
00:06:57,050 --> 00:07:03,050
I thought J.A. was really fast.

130
00:07:03,050 --> 00:07:05,050
I thought she was 6 or 7 seconds.

131
00:07:05,050 --> 00:07:09,050
Let's move on to the next task.

132
00:07:09,050 --> 00:07:10,050
Go!

133
00:07:12,050 --> 00:07:15,050
The last task is...

134
00:07:15,050 --> 00:07:18,050
How many times can you do a double jump?

135
00:07:18,050 --> 00:07:20,050
Challenge!

136
00:07:20,050 --> 00:07:22,050
I can do it.

137
00:07:22,050 --> 00:07:24,050
Yes, you can do it.

138
00:07:24,050 --> 00:07:25,872
That's all.

139
00:07:25,872 --> 00:07:27,872
No more retry.

140
00:07:27,872 --> 00:07:29,872
Let's go!

141
00:07:29,872 --> 00:07:31,872
Rock, paper, scissors.

142
00:07:31,872 --> 00:07:33,872
The winner is...

143
00:07:33,872 --> 00:07:35,872
The winner is...

144
00:07:35,872 --> 00:07:37,872
Okay.

145
00:07:37,872 --> 00:07:39,872
Rock, paper, scissors.

146
00:07:39,872 --> 00:07:41,872
Wow!

147
00:07:41,872 --> 00:07:43,872
Rock, paper, scissors.

148
00:07:43,872 --> 00:07:46,010
Wow!

149
00:07:46,010 --> 00:07:48,010
Rock, paper, scissors!

150
00:07:48,010 --> 00:07:49,010
Oh!

151
00:07:49,010 --> 00:07:50,010
It's the first one!

152
00:07:50,010 --> 00:07:51,010
Oh!

153
00:07:51,010 --> 00:07:52,010
It's the first one!

154
00:07:52,010 --> 00:07:54,010
Rock, paper, scissors!

155
00:07:54,010 --> 00:07:55,010
Oh!

156
00:07:55,010 --> 00:07:56,010
You're the only one who can do it.

157
00:07:56,010 --> 00:07:57,010
You're the only one.

158
00:07:57,010 --> 00:07:58,010
Oh!

159
00:07:59,010 --> 00:08:00,010
Then, I'll go to the last one.

160
00:08:00,010 --> 00:08:01,010
Wait, wait, wait!

161
00:08:01,010 --> 00:08:02,010
Oh!

162
00:08:02,010 --> 00:08:03,010
Rock, paper, scissors!

163
00:08:03,010 --> 00:08:04,896
Oh!

164
00:08:04,896 --> 00:08:06,896
I'm going to win.

165
00:08:06,896 --> 00:08:08,896
I'm going to win.

166
00:08:12,896 --> 00:08:15,896
I don't know the principle of double
jump.

167
00:08:15,896 --> 00:08:17,896
I'm going to be the first.

168
00:08:17,896 --> 00:08:24,794
I thought I would be the first.

169
00:08:24,794 --> 00:08:26,794
I'll do it twice.

170
00:08:26,794 --> 00:08:28,794
I'll do it twice.

171
00:08:28,794 --> 00:08:30,794
I'll jump a lot.

172
00:08:30,794 --> 00:08:32,794
I think I'll spread my arms.

173
00:08:32,794 --> 00:08:34,794
I'm scared.

174
00:08:34,794 --> 00:08:36,794
I think it's better to hold your arms.

175
00:08:36,794 --> 00:08:38,794
I'll hold my arms.

176
00:08:38,794 --> 00:08:40,794
The second challenge.

177
00:08:40,794 --> 00:08:42,794
I'll do it.

178
00:08:42,794 --> 00:08:44,794
It's a challenge from Oharu.

179
00:08:44,794 --> 00:08:46,794
I'll do my best.

180
00:08:46,794 --> 00:08:48,794
I'll hold my arms.

181
00:08:48,794 --> 00:08:50,794
I'll turn my wrist.

182
00:08:50,794 --> 00:08:52,128
I'll turn my wrist.

183
00:08:52,128 --> 00:08:54,128
For now, I'll do it twice.

184
00:08:54,128 --> 00:08:56,128
I'll do it twice.

185
00:08:56,128 --> 00:08:58,128
Yes.

186
00:08:58,128 --> 00:09:00,128
I'll do it twice.

187
00:09:00,128 --> 00:09:02,128
I'll do it twice.

188
00:09:02,128 --> 00:09:03,578
I'll do it twice.

189
00:09:03,578 --> 00:09:05,578
I don't know how to play this game.

190
00:09:05,578 --> 00:09:07,578
I don't know the rules.

191
00:09:07,578 --> 00:09:09,578
You are close.

192
00:09:09,578 --> 00:09:11,578
You are close.

193
00:09:11,578 --> 00:09:13,578
You are close.

194
00:09:13,578 --> 00:09:15,578
You are close.

195
00:09:17,578 --> 00:09:19,578
You are close.

196
00:09:19,578 --> 00:09:21,578
You are close.

197
00:09:21,578 --> 00:09:23,578
The first one was close.

198
00:09:23,578 --> 00:09:25,578
The first one was close.

199
00:09:25,578 --> 00:09:27,578
Let's play the last one.

200
00:09:27,578 --> 00:09:31,610
The last one.

201
00:09:31,610 --> 00:09:33,610
It's close!

202
00:09:33,610 --> 00:09:35,610
It's close!

203
00:09:35,610 --> 00:09:37,610
It's close!

204
00:09:39,610 --> 00:09:41,610
I can't believe it!

205
00:09:41,610 --> 00:09:43,610
You just said once, didn't you?

206
00:09:43,610 --> 00:09:45,610
I didn't say it!

207
00:09:45,610 --> 00:09:47,610
I thought you were going to cry.

208
00:09:47,610 --> 00:09:49,610
I thought you were going to cry.

209
00:09:49,610 --> 00:09:51,610
I can't watch this episode.

210
00:09:51,610 --> 00:09:53,610
I can't watch this episode.

211
00:09:53,610 --> 00:09:55,610
Let's go to the next episode!

212
00:09:55,610 --> 00:09:57,610
Let's start the challenge!

213
00:09:57,610 --> 00:09:59,610
Let's start the challenge!

214
00:09:59,610 --> 00:10:01,056
This is scary!

215
00:10:01,056 --> 00:10:03,056
Let's go!

216
00:10:06,056 --> 00:10:08,056
Amazing!

217
00:10:08,056 --> 00:10:11,930
I won!

218
00:10:11,930 --> 00:10:13,930
16!

219
00:10:13,930 --> 00:10:15,930
Wow!

220
00:10:15,930 --> 00:10:17,930
16!

221
00:10:17,930 --> 00:10:19,930
Wow!

222
00:10:19,930 --> 00:10:23,930
You're really good at jumping!

223
00:10:23,930 --> 00:10:26,930
I had a hard time jumping.

224
00:10:26,930 --> 00:10:29,930
I'm getting goosebumps.

225
00:10:29,930 --> 00:10:31,930
Who is it?

226
00:10:31,930 --> 00:10:33,930
Who is it?

227
00:10:33,930 --> 00:10:35,834
Well...

228
00:10:35,834 --> 00:10:37,834
It's a challenge!

229
00:10:37,834 --> 00:10:46,970
Please!

230
00:10:46,970 --> 00:10:48,970
Oh, it's soft.

231
00:10:49,970 --> 00:10:50,970
Amazing.

232
00:10:51,970 --> 00:10:52,970
You did it.

233
00:10:53,970 --> 00:10:54,970
You have to catch it.

234
00:10:54,970 --> 00:10:55,970
I'm so happy.

235
00:10:58,970 --> 00:10:59,970
I'm going to do it.

236
00:11:00,970 --> 00:11:02,970
Aki-chan, you can do it.

237
00:11:02,970 --> 00:11:03,970
You can do it.

238
00:11:04,970 --> 00:11:06,970
I want you to catch it.

239
00:11:08,970 --> 00:11:09,970
Can you do it?

240
00:11:09,970 --> 00:11:10,970
Okay.

241
00:11:10,970 --> 00:11:11,970
It's Aki-chan's challenge.

242
00:11:11,970 --> 00:11:20,954
Please do your best.

243
00:11:20,954 --> 00:11:22,954
I got it!

244
00:11:22,954 --> 00:11:24,954
You got it!

245
00:11:24,954 --> 00:11:26,954
You got 12 questions right!

246
00:11:26,954 --> 00:11:28,954
Wow!

247
00:11:30,954 --> 00:11:32,954
You guys are amazing.

248
00:11:32,954 --> 00:11:34,954
I'm so happy.

249
00:11:34,954 --> 00:11:36,954
You guys are amazing.

250
00:11:36,954 --> 00:11:38,954
You guys are amazing.

251
00:11:38,954 --> 00:11:40,954
I got a question.

252
00:11:40,954 --> 00:11:42,954
Okay, let's go!

253
00:11:42,954 --> 00:11:44,954
Here we go!

254
00:11:44,954 --> 00:11:46,954
The camera is moving.

255
00:11:46,954 --> 00:11:48,954
You're so fast!

256
00:11:52,954 --> 00:11:54,954
You're so fast!

257
00:11:54,954 --> 00:11:56,954
I'm tired.

258
00:11:56,954 --> 00:11:58,954
You're so fast!

259
00:11:58,954 --> 00:12:00,954
You're so fast!

260
00:12:00,954 --> 00:12:02,954
You're so fast!

261
00:12:02,954 --> 00:12:04,346
I'm tired.

262
00:12:04,346 --> 00:12:06,346
I'm tired.

263
00:12:06,346 --> 00:12:08,346
Let's do one song.

264
00:12:09,346 --> 00:12:10,346
The second song

265
00:12:11,346 --> 00:12:12,346
OK?

266
00:12:12,346 --> 00:12:14,346
I'll challenge you.

267
00:12:14,346 --> 00:12:15,346
Go!

268
00:12:25,346 --> 00:12:26,346
I did it!

269
00:12:26,346 --> 00:12:27,770
I did it!

270
00:12:27,770 --> 00:12:29,770
It's been 12 times!

271
00:12:29,770 --> 00:12:31,770
12 times!

272
00:12:35,770 --> 00:12:37,770
It's been 12 times since we started
practicing.

273
00:12:37,770 --> 00:12:39,770
It's been 12 times!

274
00:12:41,770 --> 00:12:43,770
I thought I was going to win.

275
00:12:43,770 --> 00:12:45,770
I thought I was going to win.

276
00:12:47,770 --> 00:12:49,770
So, the rope skipping is over.

277
00:12:49,770 --> 00:12:51,770
It's over.

278
00:12:51,770 --> 00:12:53,770
The winner is the 16th person!

279
00:12:53,770 --> 00:12:55,770
Yay!

280
00:12:55,770 --> 00:12:57,770
You're strong!

281
00:12:57,914 --> 00:13:00,914
I didn't expect to eat 16 times.

282
00:13:00,914 --> 00:13:02,914
I'm happy.

283
00:13:02,914 --> 00:13:07,914
I was jumping.

284
00:13:07,914 --> 00:13:12,240
How was it?

285
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:15,240
Well, how was it?

286
00:13:15,240 --> 00:13:17,240
It was close.

287
00:13:17,240 --> 00:13:19,240
The speed of the rope was faster, right?

288
00:13:19,240 --> 00:13:20,240
Yes.

289
00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:21,240
A little more.

290
00:13:21,240 --> 00:13:22,240
You can do it in a little while.

291
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:23,240
Thank you.

292
00:13:23,240 --> 00:13:24,240
I think you can do it.

293
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:39,420
I'll do it until I can do the double
jump in the

294
00:13:39,420 --> 00:13:40,368
double jump.

295
00:13:40,368 --> 00:13:43,248
The winner is..

296
00:13:47,048 --> 00:13:48,328
Hitomi!

297
00:13:48,868 --> 00:13:50,628
Nice!

298
00:13:50,628 --> 00:13:52,628
You guys are strong!

299
00:13:54,746 --> 00:13:56,746
She is the best girl.

300
00:13:58,746 --> 00:14:00,746
I thought it was impossible.

301
00:14:00,746 --> 00:14:02,746
I couldn't do it at first.

302
00:14:02,746 --> 00:14:04,746
I'm happy.

303
00:14:04,746 --> 00:14:06,746
It's fun to move your body.

304
00:14:08,746 --> 00:14:10,746
I want to do a one-wheel drive.

305
00:14:10,746 --> 00:14:12,746
I can't do it.

306
00:14:14,746 --> 00:14:16,746
I want to do it upside down.

307
00:14:16,746 --> 00:14:18,746
I want to do it.

308
00:14:18,746 --> 00:14:20,746
Let's do it if we have a chance.

309
00:14:20,746 --> 00:14:22,944
That's all.

310
00:14:22,944 --> 00:14:25,894
This was Tokimeki Mini Sports
Tournament.

311
00:14:25,894 --> 00:14:27,894
Thank you very much.

312
00:17:25,894 --> 00:17:27,894
Thank you very much.
