00:00.000 --> 00:04.000
 Good morning everyone!

00:04.672 --> 00:10.912
 Chotto Kisei's early morning is now
starting!

00:10.912 --> 00:14.912
 Are you all awake?

00:14.912 --> 00:18.512
 I wonder if there are people watching
in the futon right now.

00:18.512 --> 00:20.512
 Or on the train.

00:22.512 --> 00:24.512
 This is so comfortable.

00:24.512 --> 00:27.512
 I love this space.

00:27.512 --> 00:30.512
 It's so relaxing.

00:30.512 --> 00:33.512
 It's a good morning to stay overnight.

00:33.512 --> 00:36.512
 Let's introduce ourselves.

00:36.512 --> 00:40.512
 I'm Tsujino Kanami, aka the super-
excited blue Kanamin.

00:40.512 --> 00:45.512
 I'm the super-excited pink Haruka, aka
Koizumi Haruka.

00:45.512 --> 00:49.512
 I'm the super-excited green Hiyorin,
aka Yoshikawa Hiyori.

00:49.512 --> 00:53.512
 We're all blue characters, so please
take care of us.

00:53.512 --> 01:04.512
 This program is brought to you by the
students who work hard to promote
something exciting.

01:23.512 --> 01:27.512
 The future is promising!

01:30.656 --> 01:32.016
 Thank you for watching!

01:32.016 --> 01:46.016
 This time, we are going to read the
contents of Julia, Hitoka and Aki's blog
and talk about it.

01:46.016 --> 01:50.016
 It's the first time to read a blog.

01:50.016 --> 01:51.016
 It's embarrassing.

01:51.016 --> 01:53.016
 It's the first time to read a blog.

01:53.016 --> 01:54.016
 It's embarrassing.

01:54.016 --> 01:55.016
 I don't want to read it.

01:55.016 --> 01:56.016
 It's embarrassing.

01:56.016 --> 01:58.016
 Let's read it.

01:58.016 --> 02:01.016
 I will read Julia's blog.

02:01.016 --> 02:05.016
 Julia, September 14th, 2020.

02:05.016 --> 02:07.016
 You have been in the business for 11
months.

02:07.016 --> 02:08.016
 11 months?

02:08.016 --> 02:12.016
 You have been in the business for 11
months since you made your debut today.

02:12.016 --> 02:18.016
 You have been in the business for 2
years.

02:18.016 --> 02:19.016
 Great!

02:19.016 --> 02:20.752
 You have been in the business for 2
years.

02:22.520 --> 02:26.520
 By the way, the anniversary of
MondayJr. and 14th is the same day.

02:26.520 --> 02:29.520
 It's been a long time since October
14th last year.

02:29.520 --> 02:31.520
 What? It's the same day?

02:31.520 --> 02:40.520
 I thought it was the first anniversary
since MondayJr.

02:40.520 --> 02:42.520
 It's cute.

02:44.520 --> 02:50.520
 MondayJr. updates its blog every
Monday, Monday, and Sunday.

02:50.520 --> 02:55.520
 I thought it was hot in summer until
recently.

02:55.520 --> 02:56.520
 Isn't it cute?

02:56.520 --> 02:58.520
 I thought so.

02:58.520 --> 03:02.520
 It's cool in the morning and evening
and autumn.

03:02.520 --> 03:05.520
 I can sleep without air conditioning.

03:05.520 --> 03:06.520
 Air conditioning?

03:06.520 --> 03:08.520
 I mean, air conditioner.

03:08.520 --> 03:12.520
 I thought it was hot to wear long
sleeves today.

03:12.520 --> 03:20.520
 I went to school in the morning and
wore long sleeves because I was in the
school.

03:20.520 --> 03:22.520
 It was cold.

03:22.520 --> 03:24.520
 It was cold.

03:24.520 --> 03:26.520
 What's the content of this?

03:26.520 --> 03:27.520
 It's okay.

03:27.520 --> 03:30.520
 It was cold to wear long sleeves even
in the school.

03:30.520 --> 03:34.520
 I have been eating chestnuts a lot in
the autumn.

03:34.520 --> 03:39.520
 I eat chestnut rice or chestnut honey
with ice cream.

03:39.520 --> 03:44.520
 I mix it with pancakes and drink Marron
Frappuccino.

03:44.520 --> 03:47.520
 I also ate chestnut parfait.

03:47.520 --> 03:49.520
 They were all delicious.

03:49.520 --> 03:52.520
 Did you eat chestnuts this year?

03:52.520 --> 03:56.656
 I ate chestnuts this year.

03:56.656 --> 04:00.736
 Congratulations

04:00.736 --> 04:08.736
 I haven't watched TV much, so I was
able to join the entertainment world and
of course the idol world without knowing
anything.

04:08.736 --> 04:11.736
 I can't believe it will be 2 years next
month.

04:11.736 --> 04:15.736
 It was my first time doing everything
twice, every time, and every time.

04:15.736 --> 04:20.736
 It was the first time I've had so many
exciting things in a row, and they were
all wonderful experiences.

04:20.736 --> 04:24.736
 This summer was special anyway.

04:24.736 --> 04:26.736
 The best!

04:26.736 --> 04:27.456
 I'm glad I was able to do it.

04:27.456 --> 04:41.456
 It was mostly a live broadcast, but I'm
grateful to everyone who supports us.

04:41.456 --> 04:46.456
 Thank you so much for always supporting
us.

04:46.456 --> 04:49.456
 Please continue to support us.

04:49.456 --> 04:54.456
 I'll probably write the same thing next
month.

04:54.456 --> 05:01.456
 I think it's similar to what you're
writing.

05:01.456 --> 05:06.456
 And this corner is a question from
Julia.

05:06.456 --> 05:09.456
 What day is it today?

05:09.456 --> 05:14.456
 Today, September 14th, is Men's
Valentine's Day.

05:14.456 --> 05:16.456
 What is that? Did you know?

05:16.456 --> 05:21.456
 It's a day when men express their love
for women.

05:21.456 --> 05:30.456
 In 1991, the Japanese Body Fashion
Association established it.

05:30.456 --> 05:32.456
 What?

05:32.456 --> 05:34.456
 It's a weird feeling.

05:34.456 --> 05:38.456
 October 11th, Tuesday.

05:39.008 --> 05:42.008
 It's been a while since we had a live
show.

05:42.008 --> 05:45.008
 We'll show you a lot of fun and intense
live performance.

05:45.008 --> 05:47.008
 We're waiting for you.

05:47.008 --> 05:48.008
 I see.

05:48.008 --> 05:49.008
 How about you?

05:49.008 --> 05:51.008
 How about you?

05:51.008 --> 05:53.008
 It's too cute.

05:53.008 --> 05:57.008
 A man who actively expresses his love
for a woman.

05:57.008 --> 05:58.008
 How about you?

06:00.008 --> 06:02.008
 It's cute.

06:02.008 --> 06:06.008
 Julia will be updated on Monday.

06:06.008 --> 06:08.008
 Wednesday is Aki-chan.

06:08.008 --> 06:10.008
 Wednesday is Aki-chan.

06:10.008 --> 06:12.008
 Friday is Yori-chan.

06:12.008 --> 06:17.008
 It's a great show.

06:17.008 --> 06:20.008
 It's already our second anniversary.

06:20.008 --> 06:22.008
 It's been a while since we had a live
show.

06:22.008 --> 06:25.008
 It's like we've been here the other
day.

06:25.008 --> 06:28.008
 Aki-chan came here two days ago.

06:28.008 --> 06:36.008
 We didn't talk at first.

06:36.008 --> 06:39.008
 But now we're talking a lot.

06:39.008 --> 06:42.008
 Julia talks to us a lot.

06:42.008 --> 06:46.074
 Please look forward to the next video!

06:46.074 --> 06:48.074
 We've really grown up.

06:50.074 --> 06:54.074
 Next week, we'll be celebrating our 2nd
anniversary.

06:55.074 --> 06:56.074
 Congratulations!

06:57.074 --> 06:59.074
 I hope our fans will tweet about it.

07:00.074 --> 07:02.074
 I think everyone will tweet about it.

07:02.074 --> 07:04.074
 Like, 2 years of ANSAN.

07:07.074 --> 07:11.074
 2 years of ANSAN following 1 Day Juria.

07:11.074 --> 07:15.074
 Intonation.

07:16.074 --> 07:17.074
 I hope you'll do it.

07:17.074 --> 07:18.074
 2 years of Juria.

07:18.074 --> 07:20.074
 That's good. 2 years of Juria.

07:22.074 --> 07:23.074
 It's meaningful.

07:23.074 --> 07:27.066
 Let's do it.

07:27.066 --> 07:29.066
 And, ZIP HANADA!

07:29.066 --> 07:35.066
 We are so grateful to have such a great
audience.

07:35.066 --> 07:39.066
 I didn't expect to go home with such a
big audience.

07:39.066 --> 07:46.066
 On July 18th, we will hold a concert
there.

07:46.066 --> 07:52.066
 We will perform at the venue and we
will go home with a great performance.

07:52.066 --> 07:54.066
 I'm so happy.

07:54.066 --> 07:56.464
 ZIP HANADA, thank you!

07:57.464 --> 07:59.464
 I'm so happy.

08:00.464 --> 08:02.464
 Next, I'm going to read a blog of
Hitoka.

08:03.464 --> 08:05.464
 Is it OK? It's about an hour long.

08:06.464 --> 08:09.464
 It's a long blog.

08:11.464 --> 08:13.464
 It's a blog that says,

08:14.464 --> 08:17.464
 I can do anything if I update the blog
of Hitoka on August 28th.

08:18.464 --> 08:19.464
 Good evening, I'm Hitoka.

08:20.464 --> 08:21.464
 She looks cute.

08:21.464 --> 08:24.464
 I feel more united to perform with the
members.

08:25.464 --> 08:28.464
 I'm impatient because I can see the
growth of Julia and Aki-chan.

08:29.464 --> 08:31.464
 I sometimes call her Sakai.

08:32.464 --> 08:37.464
 I'm glad that all the members did a
good job without thinking that it was
hard.

08:38.464 --> 08:40.464
 The charm of the super and the rare is
always positive.

08:41.464 --> 08:43.464
 And each of them has a great
personality.

08:43.464 --> 08:50.464
 It's amazing that each of them has a
great personality and is united to
perform.

08:51.464 --> 08:52.464
 I praised myself.

08:53.464 --> 08:57.464
 The members and staff of Team Super
Rare are there.

08:58.464 --> 08:59.464
 They care about me.

09:00.464 --> 09:02.464
 I can do my best.

09:03.464 --> 09:06.464
 I can't do what I want, but I hope for
a bright future.

09:07.464 --> 09:10.464
 And I hope Team Super Rare will be
fine.

09:10.464 --> 09:18.464
 When I entered the venue of Super
Arena, I was worried that I would be too
big and feel small.

09:19.464 --> 09:23.464
 I was worried if I could dance well.

09:24.464 --> 09:28.464
 I was worried if I could dance well and
perform well.

09:29.464 --> 09:33.464
 But I imagined that everyone was in
this venue during the rehearsal.

09:34.464 --> 09:36.464
 I thought it would be beautiful if
there was a pen light.

09:37.464 --> 09:38.464
 I was a little lonely.

09:38.464 --> 09:43.464
 I was worried that I would be lonely,
but I thought I would be able to perform
with everyone someday.

09:44.464 --> 09:48.464
 I was excited and I was able to perform
with all my might.

09:49.464 --> 09:53.464
 I was thinking about everyone during
the live and performed.

09:54.464 --> 09:55.464
 Did I deliver it well?

09:56.464 --> 09:58.464
 Which song did you enjoy the most?

09:59.464 --> 10:01.464
 I enjoyed the new song very much.

10:02.464 --> 10:03.464
 I like the melody and rhythm.

10:03.464 --> 10:08.464
 I was singing with the lyrics of the
song.

10:09.464 --> 10:11.464
 Please stay with me.

10:12.464 --> 10:16.464
 I like the song, but I like the
connection talk.

10:17.464 --> 10:27.464
 I like the song, but I like the
connection talk.

10:27.464 --> 10:34.464
 I like the song, but I like the
connection talk.

10:35.464 --> 10:40.464
 I was happy to be able to sing the
song.

10:41.464 --> 10:48.464
 I want to listen to the song this
season.

10:48.464 --> 10:56.464
 I was lonely because I was worried
about how beautiful the venue would be
if it was orange.

10:57.464 --> 10:59.464
 I was able to have a new dream.

11:00.464 --> 11:04.464
 I sang with a strong feeling that 100%
orange would never come true.

11:05.464 --> 11:08.464
 Let's go to Saitama Super Arena
together.

11:09.464 --> 11:16.464
 I want to say to the staff and the
public at the live show.

11:16.464 --> 11:20.464
 Let's see the beautiful scenery
together.

11:21.464 --> 11:23.464
 Each blog is like a letter.

11:24.464 --> 11:25.464
 I agree.

11:27.464 --> 11:29.464
 It's always hot.

11:30.464 --> 11:33.464
 It's like a letter.

11:34.464 --> 11:35.464
 How are you?

11:38.464 --> 11:40.464
 I like this kind of feeling.

11:40.464 --> 11:46.464
 I always talk about it at the live
show.

11:48.344 --> 11:50.344
 It's like a report.

11:50.344 --> 11:51.344
 I know.

11:53.344 --> 11:55.344
 It's like a report, but it's also like
a video.

11:57.344 --> 11:58.344
 It's new.

11:58.344 --> 11:59.344
 That's great.

11:59.344 --> 12:00.344
 As expected of Sakai.

12:03.344 --> 12:04.344
 I like the song.

12:04.344 --> 12:05.344
 That's good.

12:05.344 --> 12:11.344
 There are people who play music every
time.

12:12.856 --> 12:17.856
 We have a new song for the song.

12:17.856 --> 12:19.856
 It's so comfortable.

12:19.856 --> 12:21.856
 Because it's in the next song.

12:21.856 --> 12:22.856
 It's cool.

12:22.856 --> 12:24.856
 I can hear it.

12:24.856 --> 12:26.856
 By adding dance to it,

12:26.856 --> 12:28.856
 It's like the next song.

12:28.856 --> 12:30.856
 It makes you feel better.

12:30.856 --> 12:32.856
 The feeling of going to that song.

12:33.856 --> 12:35.856
 It's so cute.

12:36.856 --> 12:38.856
 Personally, I really liked it.

12:38.856 --> 12:41.440
 I think it's in Sampra.

12:42.440 --> 12:44.440
 I was so moved by the sound of the
piano.

12:50.440 --> 12:52.440
 I was so moved by the sound of the
piano.

12:56.440 --> 12:58.440
 When I first heard the music, I was
like,

12:58.440 --> 13:00.440
 I was like,

13:00.440 --> 13:02.440
 I was like,

13:02.440 --> 13:04.440
 I'll never forget that.

13:07.440 --> 13:09.440
 I want to use it again.

13:09.440 --> 13:12.440
 Every time the sound source of the
piano changes,

13:12.440 --> 13:14.440
 Every time the sound source of the
piano changes,

13:14.440 --> 13:16.440
 I want to use it again.

13:18.776 --> 13:29.776
 Last, I will read the blog posted on
September 16th by Aki-chan.

13:30.776 --> 13:32.776
 Good morning, I'm Aki Suda.

13:33.776 --> 13:36.776
 Good morning to you early in the
morning.

13:37.776 --> 13:38.776
 It's a good timing.

13:40.776 --> 13:43.776
 Thank you for your comments and likes
on my blog and Instagram.

13:43.776 --> 13:55.776
 I was surprised to find a lot of stalls
that I have never eaten.

13:56.776 --> 14:00.776
 I will eat it when I find it again.

14:01.776 --> 14:02.776
 I saw it on Instagram.

14:03.776 --> 14:05.776
 And, Longhaka...

14:06.776 --> 14:07.776
 Longhaka?

14:08.776 --> 14:10.776
 I'm reading it normally.

14:10.776 --> 14:18.776
 Thank you for answering Longhaka and
Bobhaka's questions.

14:19.776 --> 14:26.776
 Thank you for your comments such as, I
like Longhaka and I want to see Aki-
chan's blog.

14:26.776 --> 14:33.776
 At this moment, I counted all of
Longhaka's 95 votes.

14:34.776 --> 14:41.776
 Bobhaka's 64 votes, Medium's 2 votes,
Half-Twin's 3 votes.

14:42.776 --> 14:45.776
 Longhaka has more votes now.

14:46.776 --> 14:49.776
 Why did you say Half-Twin when you were
listening to Longhaka and Bobhaka?

14:50.776 --> 14:51.776
 It's because of my hair style.

14:51.776 --> 14:55.776
 I want you to show your hair style.

14:57.776 --> 14:59.776
 We have the result.

15:00.776 --> 15:02.776
 Some people said they like both.

15:03.776 --> 15:04.776
 Thank you.

15:05.776 --> 15:07.776
 Medium's half-Twin's half-Bobhaka.

15:08.776 --> 15:09.776
 Thank you.

15:10.776 --> 15:13.776
 I had few votes today, but I chose
Bobhaka.

15:14.776 --> 15:15.776
 How do you like it?

15:15.776 --> 15:18.776
 I'm sorry for making it short.

15:19.776 --> 15:22.776
 I feel strange because it's been a
while since I made it short.

15:23.776 --> 15:24.776
 I'm lying.

15:25.776 --> 15:26.776
 I'm Long.

15:27.776 --> 15:29.776
 I'm sorry for lying.

15:30.776 --> 15:31.776
 We often say this.

15:33.776 --> 15:34.776
 We did it before.

15:34.776 --> 15:48.776
 We did it before.

15:49.776 --> 15:57.776
 I remember I said, how do you like it?

15:59.776 --> 16:01.776
 I'm sorry for lying again.

16:01.776 --> 16:05.776
 Thank you for watching our show.

16:06.776 --> 16:08.776
 Hoshina-chan was so cute.

16:09.776 --> 16:11.776
 Thank you for reading it until the end.

16:12.776 --> 16:15.776
 Good luck with your work, school, and
housework.

16:16.776 --> 16:19.776
 Don't forget to moisturize your body
and don't forget to eat donuts.

16:20.776 --> 16:21.776
 Why?

16:23.776 --> 16:24.776
 You're great.

16:25.776 --> 16:27.776
 I've never heard of work, school, and
housework.

16:27.776 --> 16:30.776
 I think it's new.

16:34.776 --> 16:35.776
 Bob?

16:36.776 --> 16:37.776
 Have you ever been Bob?

16:38.776 --> 16:39.776
 Is Bob here?

16:40.776 --> 16:41.776
 Bob is this long.

16:42.776 --> 16:45.776
 It's a medium that doesn't reach the
shoulder.

16:46.776 --> 16:48.776
 What is this?

16:49.776 --> 16:50.776
 Semi-long.

16:52.776 --> 16:53.776
 Long.

16:54.776 --> 16:55.776
 It's too short.

16:55.776 --> 16:56.776
 It's too short.

16:57.776 --> 16:58.776
 I'm sorry.

16:59.776 --> 17:00.776
 I'm sorry.

17:01.776 --> 17:02.776
 It's still short.

17:03.776 --> 17:05.776
 It's shorter than a person.

17:07.776 --> 17:10.776
 It's easy to think that I cut it a lot,
but it was cut in a row.

17:11.776 --> 17:14.776
 I lost that, so it's short.

17:15.776 --> 17:16.776
 It's 5cm.

17:17.776 --> 17:18.776
 Really?

17:18.776 --> 17:19.776
 It's 5cm square.

17:20.776 --> 17:22.776
 I thought I cut it a lot.

17:22.776 --> 17:24.776
 But I can see it for a moment.

17:25.776 --> 17:26.776
 I can see it.

17:27.776 --> 17:32.776
 When I first saw it on the blog, I
thought,

17:33.776 --> 17:35.776
 Did you cut it?

17:36.776 --> 17:37.776
 I was deceived.

17:40.776 --> 17:43.776
 I thought I wasn't told anything.

17:44.776 --> 17:48.776
 I thought, Did I talk about that?

17:48.776 --> 17:51.776
 My mother was deceived.

17:52.776 --> 17:53.776
 Isn't this good?

17:54.776 --> 17:55.776
 You're good.

17:55.776 --> 17:57.776
 You put seeds on it, didn't you?

17:57.776 --> 17:58.776
 On the back.

18:00.776 --> 18:05.776
 If Aki-chan becomes Bob, there will be
more people who say Bob is good.

18:06.776 --> 18:07.776
 I think so.

18:07.776 --> 18:12.512
 I think it's better now.

18:13.512 --> 18:15.512
 I think it's better to cut it shorter.

18:15.512 --> 18:17.512
 It looks good on you.

18:19.512 --> 18:21.512
 I think it's the same with Nao-chan.

18:21.512 --> 18:24.512
 Long hair is good, but short hair is
also cute.

18:27.512 --> 18:31.512
 Short hair suits people who look good
on it and people who don't.

18:31.512 --> 18:33.512
 So I think it's better to cut it
shorter.

18:36.512 --> 18:38.512
 I want to cut it a little more.

18:38.512 --> 18:41.512
 I've seen it before.

18:41.512 --> 18:44.512
 I've never seen a short hair like this.

18:47.576 --> 18:49.576
 I want to cut it.

18:49.576 --> 18:51.576
 I want to cut it too.

18:52.576 --> 18:54.576
 I don't want to cut it anymore.

18:54.576 --> 18:56.576
 I want to cut it.

18:58.576 --> 19:00.576
 I want to cut it.

19:00.576 --> 19:02.576
 I don't want to cut it now.

19:02.576 --> 19:04.576
 I want to cut it.

19:06.576 --> 19:10.576
 Before I cut it, it was this long.

19:10.576 --> 19:12.576
 I wanted to cut it.

19:12.576 --> 19:16.576
 I cut it twice.

19:17.576 --> 19:18.576
 I don't want to cut it anymore.

19:18.576 --> 19:20.576
 I want to grow it.

19:20.576 --> 19:22.576
 I'm growing it now.

19:22.576 --> 19:24.576
 I want to grow it more.

19:24.576 --> 19:26.576
 I want to grow it.

19:26.576 --> 19:28.576
 At the beginning?

19:28.576 --> 19:31.576
 I want to grow it beautifully.

19:31.576 --> 19:33.576
 How do you think, MINE?

19:33.576 --> 19:35.576
 It's cute.

19:35.576 --> 19:36.576
 I know.

19:36.576 --> 19:38.576
 I saw it too.

19:38.576 --> 19:39.576
 I saw it.

19:39.576 --> 19:41.576
 It was cute.

19:41.576 --> 19:42.688
 It's really cute.

19:42.688 --> 19:43.872
 my neck...

19:44.872 --> 19:46.872
 We met at the Stablofest.

19:49.872 --> 19:51.872
 Mirei's hair color was so cute.

19:52.872 --> 19:54.872
 It was brown and pink.

19:55.872 --> 19:57.872
 It was so cute.

19:58.872 --> 20:05.872
 I had a chance to talk with Mirei
before going on stage.

20:06.872 --> 20:07.872
 We were waiting for the same time.

20:08.872 --> 20:09.872
 I said, you are cute.

20:09.872 --> 20:11.872
 She said, I'm glad I dyed my hair.

20:13.872 --> 20:15.872
 You are always fashionable.

20:16.872 --> 20:18.872
 You are cute on Instagram.

20:19.872 --> 20:21.872
 I want to be a cute woman.

20:22.872 --> 20:23.872
 I admire you.

20:24.872 --> 20:27.872
 I saw you on Instagram.

20:28.872 --> 20:29.872
 You are Mirei.

20:31.872 --> 20:32.872
 I saw you on the debut stage.

20:33.872 --> 20:34.872
 You and Piyo were so cute.

20:34.872 --> 20:35.872
 I'm glad I dyed my hair.

20:36.872 --> 20:37.872
 I'm glad I dyed my hair.

20:40.872 --> 20:45.872
 Mirei was cute when we were recording.

20:46.872 --> 20:47.872
 Mirei is cute.

20:48.872 --> 20:54.872
 I was able to talk with Mirei for the
first time.

20:56.872 --> 20:58.872
 I didn't say it on TV.

20:58.872 --> 21:03.872
 When I took a picture with Mirei,

21:04.256 --> 21:08.496
 Aki-chan had known Mirei-chan for a
long time.

21:08.496 --> 21:10.496
 I told Mirei-chan about it.

21:10.496 --> 21:11.496
 And Mirei-chan said,

21:11.496 --> 21:14.496
 Ah, I'm happy.

21:14.496 --> 21:17.496
 You're cute in that.

21:17.496 --> 21:20.496
 But there was an angel.

21:20.496 --> 21:25.496
 But we were both nervous at night.

21:25.496 --> 21:28.496
 I'm not taking Aki-chan, but...

21:28.496 --> 21:30.496
 Are you a parent?

21:30.496 --> 21:35.496
 Usually, there are two of us.

21:35.496 --> 21:39.496
 I'm the older sister.

21:39.496 --> 21:43.496
 Aki-chan's recording is like this.

21:43.496 --> 21:45.496
 It's not all of us.

21:45.496 --> 21:48.496
 It's the first time we've been close.

21:48.496 --> 21:50.496
 I thought I had to be good at reading.

21:50.496 --> 21:53.496
 I don't have a sister I can rely on.

21:53.496 --> 21:55.496
 It's like Aki-chan.

21:55.496 --> 21:57.496
 I was nervous at night.

21:57.496 --> 22:01.496
 Aki-chan did her best.

22:01.496 --> 22:04.496
 I think it was a good broadcast.

22:04.496 --> 22:06.496
 The senior at STA-LAND said,

22:06.496 --> 22:09.496
 I want to meet Aki-chan.

22:09.496 --> 22:14.496
 I hope I can meet STA-LAND again.

22:14.496 --> 22:17.496
 I don't know if it's going to be like
that.

22:17.496 --> 22:19.496
 I hope it's calm.

22:19.496 --> 22:25.496
 So, I read everyone's blog today.

22:25.496 --> 22:30.496
 Each of us had a lot of personality.

22:30.496 --> 22:40.986
 You can tell by this, right?

22:40.986 --> 22:48.986
 We have been planning for 3 months for
our debut album.

22:48.986 --> 22:53.986
 We have an announcement for that.

22:53.986 --> 22:59.986
 It will be announced this evening, so
please look forward to it.

22:59.986 --> 23:04.986
 Please check out our blog as well.

23:04.986 --> 23:07.986
 Please check out our blog.

23:07.986 --> 23:10.986
 So, please check out our blog.

23:10.986 --> 23:13.986
 We are CHO! Tekimitsu Endeavor.

23:13.986 --> 23:17.986
 Have a good day.

23:17.986 --> 23:19.986
 I want to be a drama.

23:19.986 --> 23:20.986
 I want to be a drama.

23:20.986 --> 23:22.986
 I want to be a drama.

23:22.986 --> 23:48.986
 I want to be a drama.

23:48.986 --> 23:56.986
 We are going to have a project to get
the songs for our debut album.

23:56.986 --> 24:06.986
 We are going to get the songs for our
debut album.

24:06.986 --> 24:09.986
 We don't charge for the songs.

24:09.986 --> 24:13.986
 You can apply for any songs.

24:13.986 --> 24:17.986
 We have a prize for the best song.

24:17.986 --> 24:20.986
 We are waiting for your application.

24:20.986 --> 24:23.986
 We are waiting for your application.

24:27.224 --> 24:32.224
 Hello everyone. My name is H.Y.P.

24:33.224 --> 24:35.224
 I'm Hiyori Yoshikawa Pio.

24:37.224 --> 24:39.224
 I'm looking forward to your
application.

24:39.224 --> 24:45.224
 Thank you for watching.

24:45.424 --> 24:49.424
 I miss you

25:10.784 --> 25:15.584
 I'll be waiting forever

25:26.010 --> 25:33.010
 You're not coming back here anymore,
are you?

25:34.480 --> 25:38.480
 I can say, I can say, I can say it

25:38.480 --> 25:41.480
 Stay with me a little bit more

25:41.480 --> 25:46.480
 I love you, I love you

25:46.480 --> 25:49.480
 Hey, I will never forget

25:49.480 --> 25:52.480
 Under the sky where we met

25:52.480 --> 25:58.480
 I love you, I love you

25:58.624 --> 26:01.424
 I'm happy just to be like this

26:01.424 --> 26:05.024
 This kind of time is happiness

26:05.024 --> 26:08.904
 A rainbow-colored bench

26:08.904 --> 26:12.904
 Will never change

26:23.866 --> 26:34.566
 Benji! One, two, six, nine!
