1
00:00:00,040 --> 00:00:03,560
Plå¿œ pearls

2
00:00:03,560 --> 00:00:07,760
swords

3
00:00:07,760 --> 00:00:09,460
Let's enjoy his bars.

4
00:00:11,424 --> 00:00:14,424
Thank you!

5
00:00:15,424 --> 00:00:17,424
We're Mayagoshi!

6
00:00:17,424 --> 00:00:18,424
Nice!

7
00:00:18,424 --> 00:00:25,424
Recently, I've been thinking about how
to make Ebichu more popular and more
popular.

8
00:00:25,424 --> 00:00:28,424
I've been thinking about it for about 17
hours a day.

9
00:00:28,424 --> 00:00:29,424
You've been thinking that much?

10
00:00:29,424 --> 00:00:30,424
In a dark room.

11
00:00:30,424 --> 00:00:31,424
Scary!

12
00:00:31,424 --> 00:00:33,424
It's dangerous!

13
00:00:33,424 --> 00:00:34,424
Are you okay?

14
00:00:34,424 --> 00:00:42,424
I'll tell you my conclusion. We need to
know more about each other.

15
00:00:42,424 --> 00:00:46,832
We know each other. We don't know each
other well.

16
00:00:47,832 --> 00:00:51,832
We are good friends. We know each other
well.

17
00:00:52,832 --> 00:00:53,832
Not enough.

18
00:00:54,832 --> 00:00:56,832
Not enough to have a nursery school in
Tokyo.

19
00:00:56,832 --> 00:00:57,832
Not enough at all.

20
00:00:58,832 --> 00:00:59,832
Not enough?

21
00:00:59,832 --> 00:01:00,832
Not enough.

22
00:01:01,832 --> 00:01:03,832
We know each other well. We don't know
each other well.

23
00:01:04,832 --> 00:01:05,832
Is that so?

24
00:01:05,832 --> 00:01:07,216
Because...

25
00:01:08,216 --> 00:01:09,216
We're both sold out!

26
00:01:09,216 --> 00:01:10,216
What? Why?

27
00:01:11,216 --> 00:01:13,216
Wait, can you say my full name?

28
00:01:14,216 --> 00:01:15,216
Hoshino Mirei!

29
00:01:15,216 --> 00:01:17,216
Wow! That's amazing!

30
00:01:17,216 --> 00:01:18,216
Let's give her a hand!

31
00:01:20,216 --> 00:01:22,216
No, no, no! Stop it!

32
00:01:22,216 --> 00:01:25,216
I'm not making this up.

33
00:01:25,216 --> 00:01:26,216
You're a genius.

34
00:01:26,216 --> 00:01:28,216
What do you mean?

35
00:01:29,216 --> 00:01:31,216
So you know about me?

36
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:33,840
You know my name, right?

37
00:01:38,848 --> 00:01:39,848
Kobakaho?

38
00:01:39,848 --> 00:01:40,848
Chan is Mayama!

39
00:01:40,848 --> 00:01:43,848
No matter how you look at it, it's
Mayama!

40
00:01:43,848 --> 00:01:44,848
Ah, it's Mayama!

41
00:01:44,848 --> 00:01:47,848
Kobakaho or Mayama, it's a double-edged
sword!

42
00:01:47,848 --> 00:01:48,848
What double-edged sword?

43
00:01:48,848 --> 00:01:49,848
Sorry, sorry.

44
00:01:49,848 --> 00:01:50,848
It's weird to have two swords.

45
00:01:50,848 --> 00:01:51,848
I'm sorry.

46
00:01:51,848 --> 00:01:56,848
Born on December 16, 1996, 22 years old,
A-type,

47
00:01:56,848 --> 00:01:59,848
two brothers with three older brothers,

48
00:01:59,848 --> 00:02:02,096
they played soccer in elementary school.

49
00:02:03,096 --> 00:02:04,096
I'm right-sided and I'm Maya-maya.

50
00:02:04,096 --> 00:02:05,096
You know a lot.

51
00:02:05,096 --> 00:02:07,096
No, not everyone knows that much.

52
00:02:07,096 --> 00:02:08,096
Oh, that's it.

53
00:02:08,096 --> 00:02:11,096
I came to Stardust for the Kawasaki
audition in spring.

54
00:02:11,096 --> 00:02:14,096
I've been doing it all the time.

55
00:02:14,096 --> 00:02:16,096
I'm a youngster.

56
00:02:16,096 --> 00:02:17,632
I'm Maya-maya.

57
00:02:18,632 --> 00:02:20,632
I was auditioned for Kawasaki in spring.

58
00:02:21,632 --> 00:02:23,632
I was asked to do a self-PR.

59
00:02:24,632 --> 00:02:26,632
I was really into it at the time.

60
00:02:26,632 --> 00:02:28,632
I said I would imitate Yukie Nakamura.

61
00:02:28,632 --> 00:02:29,632
I said, you guys!

62
00:02:29,632 --> 00:02:31,632
And I joined the agency.

63
00:02:33,632 --> 00:02:35,632
If I say I'm a fetishist,

64
00:02:35,632 --> 00:02:39,632
I was asked to do a psychological
analysis and be a queen.

65
00:02:39,632 --> 00:02:40,632
That's Maya-maya.

66
00:02:40,632 --> 00:02:41,632
I'm a youngster!

67
00:02:41,632 --> 00:02:43,152
I'm Maya-maya.

68
00:02:44,072 --> 00:02:46,392
So, um you know when people...

69
00:02:46,672 --> 00:02:49,152
take deep breaths in the office they're
like

70
00:02:50,412 --> 00:02:54,252
This person took a deep breath in the
office and literally felt embarrassed

71
00:02:54,252 --> 00:02:56,932
Then the wall got felled and it was me.

72
00:02:57,752 --> 00:02:59,052
... so then now

73
00:03:00,332 --> 00:03:02,532
your abs are breaking apart

74
00:03:02,532 --> 00:03:03,052
and your arms are gone

75
00:03:03,392 --> 00:03:04,572
like BAM! BAM! BAM!

76
00:03:04,572 --> 00:03:06,372
Scary!

77
00:03:08,008 --> 00:03:10,008
That's the most Maya-like!

78
00:03:10,008 --> 00:03:12,008
When I heard BAM! BAM! BAM!

79
00:03:12,008 --> 00:03:17,008
The agency told me to stop training my
muscles.

80
00:03:17,008 --> 00:03:22,008
So, you're saying that I talk weird and
move weird?

81
00:03:22,008 --> 00:03:24,008
That's the little idiot.

82
00:03:24,008 --> 00:03:29,008
You're the little idiot who talks weird
and moves weird.

83
00:03:29,008 --> 00:03:33,008
So, you're saying that I'm Johnny the
cockroach?

84
00:03:33,008 --> 00:03:34,008
That's the little idiot.

85
00:03:34,008 --> 00:03:36,624
And I'm Maya.

86
00:03:36,624 --> 00:03:37,624
Do you understand?

87
00:03:37,624 --> 00:03:39,624
Yes, I do.

88
00:03:39,624 --> 00:03:42,124
You don't know each other at all, do
you?

89
00:03:42,124 --> 00:03:43,624
You're the only one!

90
00:03:43,624 --> 00:03:44,624
Thank you very much.

91
00:03:44,624 --> 00:03:45,624
Wonderful!

92
00:03:45,624 --> 00:03:46,624
Wonderful!

93
00:03:46,624 --> 00:03:47,624
Wonderful!

94
00:03:47,624 --> 00:03:50,624
This is pretty...

95
00:03:57,624 --> 00:04:02,624
The second team is the KASHIMAGI-
NAKAYAMA duo of Mr. Kimoto's team.

96
00:04:02,624 --> 00:04:04,624
Thank you very much.

97
00:04:06,984 --> 00:04:07,984
Keep it up, Yanpo.

98
00:04:07,984 --> 00:04:08,984
What? A contract?

99
00:04:09,984 --> 00:04:14,984
Ah, I'm so bored when I have time to
work as a telephone appointment.

100
00:04:19,984 --> 00:04:21,984
Yes, thank you for calling.

101
00:04:21,984 --> 00:04:24,984
This is the customer service center of
the Bonny's family restaurant.

102
00:04:24,984 --> 00:04:25,984
Hello.

103
00:04:25,984 --> 00:04:27,984
Yes, thank you for calling.

104
00:04:27,984 --> 00:04:31,984
I went to that restaurant yesterday.

105
00:04:31,984 --> 00:04:33,984
Yes, thank you for calling.

106
00:04:33,984 --> 00:04:36,984
Did you have any problem at that
restaurant?

107
00:04:36,984 --> 00:04:38,984
There were a lot of problems.

108
00:04:40,984 --> 00:04:44,984
Could you tell me what kind of problems
you had?

109
00:04:44,984 --> 00:04:45,984
I ate that.

110
00:04:45,984 --> 00:04:47,984
Fresh cream pasta.

111
00:04:48,984 --> 00:04:49,984
Yes.

112
00:04:49,984 --> 00:04:50,984
What is that?

113
00:04:51,984 --> 00:04:55,984
Did you have any problem with the fresh
cream pasta?

114
00:04:55,984 --> 00:04:57,984
I'm not kidding.

115
00:04:57,984 --> 00:04:58,984
What?

116
00:04:58,984 --> 00:05:05,984
The cream was mixed with the pasta.

117
00:05:05,984 --> 00:05:12,984
I put it in my mouth and I felt like I
didn't want to swallow it.

118
00:05:13,984 --> 00:05:17,984
So, you mean it was delicious?

119
00:05:17,984 --> 00:05:18,984
Shut up.

120
00:05:18,984 --> 00:05:19,984
I'm not finished yet.

121
00:05:19,984 --> 00:05:20,984
I'm sorry.

122
00:05:20,984 --> 00:05:23,984
Do you have pizza?

123
00:05:23,984 --> 00:05:25,984
Yes, I have.

124
00:05:25,984 --> 00:05:28,984
What is that? I'm not kidding.

125
00:05:30,984 --> 00:05:33,984
Did you use the cheese from the Swiss
cheese factory?

126
00:05:33,984 --> 00:05:36,984
I brought the cheese from the Swiss
cheese factory.

127
00:05:36,984 --> 00:05:38,984
What is that cheese?

128
00:05:38,984 --> 00:05:40,984
How much does it melt?

129
00:05:40,984 --> 00:05:42,984
It stretches a lot.

130
00:05:43,984 --> 00:05:47,984
Did you mean the cheese was delicious?

131
00:05:47,984 --> 00:05:48,984
The problem is the dough.

132
00:05:48,984 --> 00:05:51,984
Did you have any problem with the dough?

133
00:05:51,984 --> 00:05:52,984
What is that dough?

134
00:05:52,984 --> 00:05:55,984
I'm not kidding.

135
00:05:55,984 --> 00:05:57,984
You're finished.

136
00:05:58,984 --> 00:06:02,984
Did you mean it was delicious?

137
00:06:02,984 --> 00:06:04,984
That's not pizza.

138
00:06:04,984 --> 00:06:06,984
It's pizza.

139
00:06:08,984 --> 00:06:09,984
What is that?

140
00:06:09,984 --> 00:06:11,984
Did you want to praise me?

141
00:06:11,984 --> 00:06:12,984
I'm scared.

142
00:06:12,984 --> 00:06:13,984
What is that?

143
00:06:17,984 --> 00:06:19,984
Thank you for calling.

144
00:06:19,984 --> 00:06:20,984
This is a family restaurant.

145
00:06:20,984 --> 00:06:21,984
Hello.

146
00:06:21,984 --> 00:06:26,984
Hello.

147
00:06:26,984 --> 00:06:28,984
You're the one who called me.

148
00:06:28,984 --> 00:06:31,984
My mother saw a dog and said to me.

149
00:06:31,984 --> 00:06:34,736
I'm a dog.

150
00:06:35,736 --> 00:06:36,736
I saw a cat and said,

151
00:06:37,736 --> 00:06:38,736
I'm a cat.

152
00:06:39,736 --> 00:06:40,736
What's that?

153
00:06:41,736 --> 00:06:43,736
It's not about the restaurant.

154
00:06:44,736 --> 00:06:45,736
So what?

155
00:06:46,736 --> 00:06:47,736
If you find a snake, you say,

156
00:06:48,736 --> 00:06:49,736
I'm a snake.

157
00:06:50,736 --> 00:06:51,736
What are you talking about?

158
00:06:52,736 --> 00:06:54,736
What's the taste of salad?

159
00:06:55,736 --> 00:06:56,736
It's just a good salt.

160
00:06:57,736 --> 00:06:59,736
It's not about the restaurant.

161
00:06:59,736 --> 00:07:02,736
I'm not a bad person.

162
00:07:03,736 --> 00:07:04,736
What's wrong?

163
00:07:05,736 --> 00:07:06,736
And...

164
00:07:08,736 --> 00:07:10,736
You have too many front legs.

165
00:07:11,736 --> 00:07:12,736
I'm fine.

166
00:07:13,736 --> 00:07:15,736
Why do you have to use that part?

167
00:07:16,736 --> 00:07:17,736
You don't say that.

168
00:07:18,736 --> 00:07:19,736
I have nothing to say.

169
00:07:20,736 --> 00:07:21,736
What time is it?

170
00:07:22,736 --> 00:07:24,736
It's time to finish my part-time job.

171
00:07:25,736 --> 00:07:27,736
Thank you for your company.

172
00:07:27,736 --> 00:07:28,736
Thank you.

173
00:07:28,736 --> 00:07:29,736
I'm a big fan of you.

174
00:07:29,736 --> 00:07:31,736
Thank you very much.

175
00:07:49,786 --> 00:07:52,786
I'm Yasumoto. I'm Kobayashi.

176
00:07:52,786 --> 00:07:54,786
Together, we are Yasukoba.

177
00:07:54,786 --> 00:07:57,968
Shortcut, concert!

178
00:07:57,968 --> 00:08:01,668
Everyone, thank you so much for coming
today.

179
00:08:01,668 --> 00:08:05,168
I'll do my best, so please support me.

180
00:08:05,168 --> 00:08:07,968
Now, the first song is Dekadonden.

181
00:08:07,968 --> 00:08:10,168
Ebichu, everyone, let's go!

182
00:08:10,168 --> 00:08:12,568
Who are you? You're weird. Why?

183
00:08:12,568 --> 00:08:14,368
Everyone thinks you're Ebichu.

184
00:08:14,368 --> 00:08:16,268
Seriously, who are you? Seriously?

185
00:08:16,268 --> 00:08:17,668
Seriously, who? Seriously, who?

186
00:08:17,668 --> 00:08:19,668
You're too close, too close, too close.

187
00:08:20,568 --> 00:08:22,068
Yes, Yasukawa!

188
00:08:24,068 --> 00:08:26,568
Shortcut, handshake!

189
00:08:26,568 --> 00:08:28,568
Thank you!

190
00:08:28,568 --> 00:08:30,568
Thank you!

191
00:08:30,568 --> 00:08:32,568
Thank you!

192
00:08:32,568 --> 00:08:33,568
Thank you!

193
00:08:33,568 --> 00:08:36,568
I've always liked you, Kaho-chan!

194
00:08:36,568 --> 00:08:38,568
I'm so happy! Thank you!

195
00:08:38,568 --> 00:08:40,568
Do you remember me?

196
00:08:40,568 --> 00:08:42,568
We've met before, but...

197
00:08:42,568 --> 00:08:46,568
Um, you're the girl who came to the
handshake event before, right?

198
00:08:46,568 --> 00:08:48,568
No, I've never been to a handshake event
before.

199
00:08:48,568 --> 00:08:50,568
Do you remember me?

200
00:08:50,568 --> 00:08:53,568
Then you're the girl who comes to our
concerts often!

201
00:08:53,568 --> 00:08:56,068
No, I've never been to a concert before.

202
00:08:56,068 --> 00:08:58,068
You have!

203
00:08:58,068 --> 00:09:02,068
Then you met me on the street and talked
to me?

204
00:09:02,068 --> 00:09:04,068
No, the street was too funny.

205
00:09:04,068 --> 00:09:06,068
It was a pot!

206
00:09:06,068 --> 00:09:10,068
Sorry, I don't remember at all. Where
did we meet?

207
00:09:10,068 --> 00:09:13,068
Where did we meet? What are you talking
about?

208
00:09:13,068 --> 00:09:17,068
We've met for the first time!

209
00:09:17,068 --> 00:09:19,068
You're a really weird person!

210
00:09:19,068 --> 00:09:21,068
Yes, Yasukawa!

211
00:09:22,568 --> 00:09:24,568
Shortcut, black peach!

212
00:09:24,568 --> 00:09:26,068
Hey, Kaho-chan.

213
00:09:26,068 --> 00:09:29,068
I'm into black peach these days.

214
00:09:29,068 --> 00:09:31,068
Oh, really?

215
00:09:31,068 --> 00:09:33,068
Black peach is so nice.

216
00:09:33,068 --> 00:09:35,068
It's popular, isn't it?

217
00:09:35,068 --> 00:09:37,068
Black peach is so cute!

218
00:09:37,068 --> 00:09:38,068
It's cute, isn't it?

219
00:09:38,068 --> 00:09:41,068
I've been watching a lot of videos of
black peach.

220
00:09:41,068 --> 00:09:45,068
No, it's not black peach. It's black
peach.

221
00:09:45,068 --> 00:09:47,068
No, it's black peach.

222
00:09:47,068 --> 00:09:48,068
No, it's black peach.

223
00:09:48,068 --> 00:09:49,068
No, it's definitely not.

224
00:09:49,068 --> 00:09:52,068
Everyone around me says black peach.

225
00:09:52,068 --> 00:09:55,068
It's black peach because it's black
peach.

226
00:09:55,068 --> 00:09:58,068
Black peach? What's that?

227
00:09:58,068 --> 00:10:00,068
What? No!

228
00:10:00,068 --> 00:10:02,068
What's black peach?

229
00:10:02,068 --> 00:10:05,068
It's a insect that lives in Kyushu and
Hokkaido.

230
00:10:05,068 --> 00:10:07,068
It's a black peach flower.

231
00:10:09,068 --> 00:10:11,068
Black peach flower?

232
00:10:14,068 --> 00:10:16,068
Yes, Yasukawa!

233
00:10:16,068 --> 00:10:18,068
I made a mistake!

234
00:10:18,068 --> 00:10:20,068
I'm sorry!

235
00:10:20,068 --> 00:10:22,068
Thank you!

236
00:10:22,068 --> 00:10:24,068
It's like a one-girl group.

237
00:10:24,068 --> 00:10:26,068
Yasukawa-san is amazing!

238
00:10:26,068 --> 00:10:29,587
It's cute!
