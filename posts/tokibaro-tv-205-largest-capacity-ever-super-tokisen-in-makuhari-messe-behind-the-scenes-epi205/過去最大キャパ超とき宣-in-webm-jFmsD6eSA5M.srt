00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Quenna Patty

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Good morning.

3
00:00:04,762 --> 00:00:08,762
I'm thinking about what to eat.

4
00:00:08,762 --> 00:00:11,762
I'm thinking about what to eat.

5
00:00:15,290 --> 00:00:17,290
I'm not good at it.

6
00:00:17,290 --> 00:00:19,290
Oh, I'm so happy.

7
00:00:29,290 --> 00:00:31,290
Let's eat.

8
00:00:31,290 --> 00:00:33,290
Bye Bye

9
00:00:33,754 --> 00:00:35,754
Good morning.

10
00:00:36,254 --> 00:00:38,254
It's a rice ball.

11
00:00:38,754 --> 00:00:40,254
How is it?

12
00:00:40,754 --> 00:00:43,754
My sister told me to raise my forehead.

13
00:00:44,754 --> 00:00:47,254
But I couldn't because I had decided.

14
00:00:47,754 --> 00:00:49,254
Good morning.

15
00:00:49,754 --> 00:00:54,754
I thought I should put something in the
rice ball before the rehearsal.

16
00:00:54,754 --> 00:01:00,754
I was very sleepy.

17
00:01:01,880 --> 00:01:03,880
I'll do my best.

18
00:01:05,880 --> 00:01:07,880
Good morning.

19
00:01:07,880 --> 00:01:09,880
Good morning.

20
00:01:17,690 --> 00:01:20,690
I'm going to perform here today!

21
00:01:20,690 --> 00:01:23,690
It was so crowded outside.

22
00:01:23,690 --> 00:01:25,690
The video manager sent me the video.

23
00:01:25,690 --> 00:01:30,690
I could see that PABULIN was cheering up
everyone.

24
00:01:30,690 --> 00:01:32,690
PABULIN is doing his best.

25
00:01:32,690 --> 00:01:42,690
Thank you for watching!

26
00:01:42,704 --> 00:01:47,204
Ho! Ho! Na! Na! Ha! Ha! Na! Na!

27
00:01:47,204 --> 00:01:48,204
Ho! Ho! Na! Ha! Ha! Na! Na!

28
00:01:48,204 --> 00:01:50,204
Ho! Ho! Na! Ha! Ha! Na! Na!

29
00:01:50,204 --> 00:01:51,704
Please!

30
00:01:51,704 --> 00:01:53,704
Let's say hello first!

31
00:01:53,704 --> 00:01:57,204
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6!

32
00:01:57,204 --> 00:01:58,704
To the hearts of the staff,

33
00:01:58,704 --> 00:01:59,704
Rock on!

34
00:01:59,704 --> 00:02:02,204
We are Super Excited Senri-P!

35
00:02:02,204 --> 00:02:04,204
Thank you!

36
00:02:05,760 --> 00:02:10,760
Thank you!

37
00:02:18,760 --> 00:02:19,760
I'm ready!

38
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:26,760
I'm ready!

39
00:02:26,760 --> 00:02:27,760
OK!

40
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:35,760
When the play is over, I'll tell you
that I'm in space.

41
00:02:36,760 --> 00:02:37,760
I'm embarrassed.

42
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:49,360
Thank you!

43
00:02:49,700 --> 00:02:52,560
Drink water before scratching the skin.

44
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:54,560
Thank you for watching.

45
00:03:00,272 --> 00:03:02,612
You thought you disappeared.

46
00:03:02,612 --> 00:03:05,392
I don't know where the miracle you told
me appeared.

47
00:03:05,712 --> 00:03:11,172
What you use devils want to sell is
always surprising.

48
00:03:11,652 --> 00:03:14,672
Through the gap of only 4 days,

49
00:03:14,672 --> 00:03:16,812
or weakness,

50
00:03:16,812 --> 00:03:18,432
you go deeper and deeper into it,

51
00:03:18,432 --> 00:03:20,772
without knowing why you filled up the
spaces in awe.

52
00:03:20,772 --> 00:03:23,132
Though there is no longer any reason,

53
00:03:23,132 --> 00:03:27,432
your feelings are yet to reach it.

54
00:03:27,532 --> 00:03:29,632
What a lie.

55
00:03:29,632 --> 00:03:31,632
This place is really nice.

56
00:03:31,632 --> 00:03:33,632
I can see everything.

57
00:03:35,632 --> 00:03:36,632
It's nice.

58
00:03:36,632 --> 00:03:39,632
The center stage is also nice.

59
00:03:39,632 --> 00:04:00,632
I want to go to all of them.

60
00:04:00,666 --> 00:04:06,166
Thank you for performing on live.

61
00:04:06,166 --> 00:04:10,166
Thank you.

62
00:04:10,166 --> 00:04:12,166
Thank you.

63
00:04:40,166 --> 00:04:42,166
Thank you for watching.

64
00:04:43,546 --> 00:04:45,546
We're going to interview.

65
00:04:46,546 --> 00:04:47,546
We're going to interview.

66
00:04:48,546 --> 00:04:49,546
We're going to interview.

67
00:04:50,546 --> 00:04:51,546
I wonder what they're going to ask us.

68
00:04:52,546 --> 00:04:53,546
I wonder if they'll answer us.

69
00:04:54,546 --> 00:04:55,546
Hello.

70
00:05:01,546 --> 00:05:02,546
It's like a stage.

71
00:05:04,546 --> 00:05:05,546
It's got a lip.

72
00:05:05,546 --> 00:05:11,546
It's got a lip.

73
00:05:16,352 --> 00:05:18,352
I wonder if it's okay.

74
00:05:18,352 --> 00:05:20,352
Why are you doing that?

75
00:05:20,352 --> 00:05:22,352
You are so cute.

76
00:05:22,352 --> 00:05:26,352
When I looked at you, your face was like
this.

77
00:05:26,352 --> 00:05:28,352
I don't know.

78
00:05:28,352 --> 00:05:30,352
You are so cute.

79
00:05:30,352 --> 00:05:34,352
You are so confident.

80
00:05:34,352 --> 00:05:37,352
You are so confident.

81
00:05:43,352 --> 00:05:45,352
Thank you for coming today.

82
00:05:45,352 --> 00:05:47,352
Let me introduce myself.

83
00:05:47,352 --> 00:05:51,352
We are super excited.

84
00:05:51,352 --> 00:05:54,352
Thank you.

85
00:05:54,352 --> 00:05:59,352
I came to this venue the day before
yesterday.

86
00:05:59,352 --> 00:06:06,352
I was surprised by the size of the
stage.

87
00:06:06,352 --> 00:06:11,352
I felt like I was at my senior's
festival.

88
00:06:11,352 --> 00:06:15,352
I'm glad that we were able to sell out
the stage.

89
00:06:15,352 --> 00:06:20,352
I hope everyone who comes here will come
back smiling.

90
00:06:20,352 --> 00:06:24,352
The stage is big, so I'm nervous.

91
00:06:24,352 --> 00:06:29,352
I'm worried, but I want to enjoy it.

92
00:06:29,352 --> 00:06:39,352
It's a stage that makes us nervous.

93
00:06:39,352 --> 00:06:46,352
I want to enjoy it with the people who
come here.

94
00:06:47,352 --> 00:06:50,352
Thank you.

95
00:06:50,352 --> 00:06:51,352
We are looking forward to it.

96
00:06:51,352 --> 00:07:05,754
Thank you.

97
00:07:05,754 --> 00:07:10,754
The relocation of the students training
center to some concerned looks the site
of the Capri University

98
00:07:10,754 --> 00:07:12,754
Thank you.

99
00:07:31,578 --> 00:07:35,578
Let's go to the audience seat together!

100
00:07:35,578 --> 00:07:37,578
Audience seat!

101
00:07:37,578 --> 00:07:39,578
Let's go to the audience seat!

102
00:07:40,578 --> 00:07:42,578
Before the show starts.

103
00:07:42,578 --> 00:07:52,250
Please subscribe to my channel!

104
00:07:52,250 --> 00:07:54,250
It's hot.

105
00:08:01,008 --> 00:08:03,008
It's so big.

106
00:08:03,008 --> 00:08:04,008
It's so big.

107
00:08:04,008 --> 00:08:06,008
It's amazing that we can enter all of
them.

108
00:08:06,008 --> 00:08:08,008
There is a synchro light this time.

109
00:08:08,008 --> 00:08:11,008
So, it's good for everyone's pen light.

110
00:08:11,008 --> 00:08:13,008
It's sparkling.

111
00:08:13,008 --> 00:08:16,008
And it can control the color.

112
00:08:16,008 --> 00:08:18,008
This side.

113
00:08:18,008 --> 00:08:19,008
It's amazing.

114
00:08:19,008 --> 00:08:22,008
If you don't have a pen light, I hope
you can use this.

115
00:08:22,008 --> 00:08:23,008
I'm glad.

116
00:08:23,008 --> 00:08:25,008
I can enjoy it.

117
00:08:25,008 --> 00:08:27,008
Let's go outside.

118
00:08:27,008 --> 00:08:28,008
Let's go.

119
00:08:28,008 --> 00:08:31,008
I think it's OK to go outside.

120
00:08:31,008 --> 00:08:33,264
Thank you.

121
00:08:33,264 --> 00:08:37,264
Where are you?

122
00:08:42,906 --> 00:08:44,906
It's so big!

123
00:08:44,906 --> 00:08:46,906
I know, right?

124
00:08:46,906 --> 00:08:48,906
Everyone is so small.

125
00:08:50,906 --> 00:08:52,906
I'm home.

126
00:08:52,906 --> 00:09:02,330
Thank you for watching.

127
00:09:02,330 --> 00:09:06,330
We all came here once.

128
00:09:06,330 --> 00:09:08,330
It's totally different from that time.

129
00:09:08,330 --> 00:09:19,834
It was a little crowded.

130
00:09:19,834 --> 00:09:23,834
Hold me so I can't run away!

131
00:09:23,834 --> 00:09:33,658
I can't stop!

132
00:09:33,658 --> 00:09:35,658
I'm so excited!

133
00:09:37,658 --> 00:09:39,658
Look! It's a bicycle stand!

134
00:09:40,658 --> 00:09:42,658
I'll ride this!

135
00:09:42,658 --> 00:09:56,658
I'm back on the stage!

136
00:09:57,466 --> 00:09:59,466
Wow!

137
00:09:59,466 --> 00:10:01,466
It's huge!

138
00:10:03,466 --> 00:10:06,466
I wonder if there are more on the top.

139
00:10:07,466 --> 00:10:09,466
Really?

140
00:10:09,466 --> 00:10:22,298
I wonder if there are more on the top.

141
00:10:22,298 --> 00:10:24,298
Everyone puts this on their wrists.

142
00:10:30,298 --> 00:10:35,298
I feel like I'm going to do a rehearsal
after this.

143
00:10:35,298 --> 00:10:44,378
What should I do?

144
00:10:44,378 --> 00:10:46,378
Hito-chan!

145
00:10:51,378 --> 00:10:52,378
Hiyori!

146
00:10:54,378 --> 00:10:55,378
Julia!

147
00:10:59,378 --> 00:11:00,378
Hello!

148
00:11:01,378 --> 00:11:02,378
It's close.

149
00:11:04,378 --> 00:11:06,378
It's like Sunny Star.

150
00:11:07,378 --> 00:11:08,378
I love you!

151
00:11:08,378 --> 00:11:11,378
I love you!

152
00:11:11,450 --> 00:11:13,450
The other side is...

153
00:11:13,450 --> 00:11:15,450
Kanamin!

154
00:11:15,450 --> 00:11:17,450
Hi!

155
00:11:17,450 --> 00:11:19,450
Hi!

156
00:11:19,450 --> 00:11:21,450
You're big!

157
00:11:21,450 --> 00:11:23,450
Did you hear that?

158
00:11:23,450 --> 00:11:25,450
You're standing out!

159
00:11:25,450 --> 00:11:27,450
What?

160
00:11:27,450 --> 00:11:29,450
You're standing out?

161
00:11:29,450 --> 00:11:31,450
You're a human after all!

162
00:11:31,450 --> 00:11:33,450
I'm kidding.

163
00:11:33,450 --> 00:11:35,450
I'm really kidding.

164
00:11:35,450 --> 00:11:37,450
I didn't know you were so tall.

165
00:11:37,450 --> 00:11:39,450
I didn't know you were so tall.

166
00:11:39,450 --> 00:11:41,114
You're amazing!

167
00:11:41,114 --> 00:11:45,114
I'll try to get to the top.

168
00:11:53,114 --> 00:11:56,114
I'll try to get to the edge.

169
00:11:56,114 --> 00:12:02,114
I'll try to get to the top.

170
00:12:02,114 --> 00:12:08,114
I'll try to get to the top.

171
00:12:08,762 --> 00:12:11,762
I can see quite a bit from here.

172
00:12:11,762 --> 00:12:13,762
I can see quite a bit.

173
00:12:14,762 --> 00:12:16,762
I can see quite a bit.

174
00:12:16,762 --> 00:12:18,762
From the top.

175
00:12:19,762 --> 00:12:25,762
It's too bright to see, but I'll try to
open my eyes and find it.

176
00:12:25,762 --> 00:12:26,762
I'll do my best.

177
00:12:28,762 --> 00:12:31,762
I think it's fun to go to any seat.

178
00:12:31,762 --> 00:12:32,762
I'll go to the truck.

179
00:12:32,762 --> 00:12:37,296
I hope you enjoy it.

180
00:12:38,296 --> 00:12:40,296
I don't need to sit in an ugly seat.

181
00:12:41,296 --> 00:12:42,296
I'm hungry.

182
00:12:45,296 --> 00:12:47,296
What time is it now?

183
00:12:49,296 --> 00:12:51,296
2.15? 2.20?

184
00:12:54,296 --> 00:12:56,296
3.20? It starts at 4.20.

185
00:12:58,296 --> 00:12:59,296
3.20?

186
00:13:01,296 --> 00:13:02,296
1 hour and 40 minutes left?

187
00:13:02,296 --> 00:13:04,296
Oh my god! 1 hour and 40 minutes left!

188
00:13:06,736 --> 00:13:08,016
I have to change my clothes.

189
00:13:10,392 --> 00:13:17,392
The staff showed me the outside.

190
00:13:18,392 --> 00:13:19,392
Then, Aki-chan said,

191
00:13:20,392 --> 00:13:22,392
Wow, there are so many PR people.

192
00:13:24,392 --> 00:13:26,392
Everyone is looking at Aki-chan.

193
00:13:29,392 --> 00:13:31,392
Isn't it amazing that there are so many
PR people?

194
00:13:32,392 --> 00:13:33,392
I can't believe it.

195
00:13:33,392 --> 00:13:36,392
There are so many people with heads and
faces.

196
00:13:36,392 --> 00:13:38,392
Everyone is looking at us.

197
00:13:39,392 --> 00:13:41,392
Aki-chan's expression is so sweet.

198
00:13:42,392 --> 00:13:43,392
It's amazing.

199
00:13:43,392 --> 00:13:45,392
If there are two eyes,

200
00:13:46,392 --> 00:13:47,392
if there are 8000 people,

201
00:13:48,392 --> 00:13:50,392
there are 16000 people watching us.

202
00:13:50,392 --> 00:13:54,128
It's amazing.

203
00:13:55,128 --> 00:13:56,128
It's amazing.

204
00:13:57,128 --> 00:13:58,128
I can't make a strange movement.

205
00:13:59,128 --> 00:14:00,128
I can see from here.

206
00:14:01,128 --> 00:14:02,128
I can see everything.

207
00:14:03,128 --> 00:14:04,128
I can see your face when you turn
around.

208
00:14:05,128 --> 00:14:06,128
I should be careful.

209
00:14:06,128 --> 00:14:08,928
I should be careful not to do something
strange.

210
00:14:09,928 --> 00:14:12,928
I slipped from the stage during the
rehearsal.

211
00:14:13,928 --> 00:14:14,928
I wasn't injured.

212
00:14:15,928 --> 00:14:18,928
I should be careful not to do something
strange.

213
00:14:19,928 --> 00:14:21,928
Everyone is separated.

214
00:14:21,928 --> 00:14:26,464
Oh, the princess is here.

215
00:14:27,464 --> 00:14:31,464
Prince, there are many people coming
today.

216
00:14:32,464 --> 00:14:33,464
You can choose from them.

217
00:14:35,464 --> 00:14:37,464
I will find the one who is perfect for
you.

218
00:14:39,464 --> 00:14:40,464
I'm the one who is destined for Julia.

219
00:14:41,464 --> 00:14:42,464
I'm the one who is destined for J.

220
00:14:43,464 --> 00:14:44,464
It's her!

221
00:14:44,464 --> 00:14:49,464
I'm the one who is destined for J.

222
00:14:52,712 --> 00:14:54,712
We are connected!

223
00:14:54,712 --> 00:14:56,712
We found the one who is destined for J.

224
00:14:56,712 --> 00:14:57,712
We just got on the boat.

225
00:14:57,712 --> 00:14:58,712
I'm sorry, everyone.

226
00:14:58,712 --> 00:14:59,712
We found you.

227
00:15:00,712 --> 00:15:01,712
We found J.

228
00:15:02,712 --> 00:15:03,712
I'm going to take off my shoes.

229
00:15:03,712 --> 00:15:04,712
I'm going to take off my shoes.

230
00:15:04,712 --> 00:15:05,712
I have to take off my shoes.

231
00:15:05,712 --> 00:15:06,712
I have to take off my shoes.

232
00:15:06,712 --> 00:15:07,712
I have to take off my shoes.

233
00:15:08,712 --> 00:15:09,712
I have to take off my shoes.

234
00:15:11,712 --> 00:15:12,712
Be careful.

235
00:15:15,712 --> 00:15:16,712
It's hot.

236
00:15:17,712 --> 00:15:18,712
It's hot.

237
00:15:18,712 --> 00:15:19,712
Stop it.

238
00:15:19,712 --> 00:15:20,712
Stop it.

239
00:15:20,712 --> 00:15:21,712
It's hot.

240
00:15:21,712 --> 00:15:22,712
It's hot.

241
00:15:22,712 --> 00:15:34,712
The camera is hot.

242
00:15:35,482 --> 00:15:43,776
Thank you for your viewing.

243
00:15:43,776 --> 00:15:45,776
You're so quick.

244
00:15:45,776 --> 00:15:47,776
How did you do that?

245
00:15:48,776 --> 00:15:50,776
You did this so that we can't see you.

246
00:15:50,776 --> 00:15:51,776
Did you see?

247
00:15:52,776 --> 00:15:56,776
I made the truck stand in front of me,
so it was super round.

248
00:15:57,776 --> 00:15:59,776
The staff did this.

249
00:15:59,776 --> 00:16:01,776
Look at this.

250
00:16:03,776 --> 00:16:05,776
This is the truck on the second floor.

251
00:16:05,776 --> 00:16:09,776
When it gets dark, the edge is so
beautiful.

252
00:16:09,776 --> 00:16:10,776
It's cute.

253
00:16:10,776 --> 00:16:13,776
It's different from the truck on the
first floor.

254
00:16:13,776 --> 00:16:14,776
I'm going to go inside.

255
00:16:14,776 --> 00:16:15,776
Let's go.

256
00:16:15,776 --> 00:16:16,776
It's high.

257
00:16:16,776 --> 00:16:21,776
It's 2 meters high.

258
00:16:24,280 --> 00:16:25,280
2 meters.

259
00:16:25,280 --> 00:16:26,280
It's about 2 meters.

260
00:16:27,280 --> 00:16:33,280
It's about 170 cm.

261
00:16:33,280 --> 00:16:34,280
2 meters and 30 cm.

262
00:16:34,280 --> 00:16:35,280
That's right.

263
00:16:36,280 --> 00:16:37,280
It's 230 cm.

264
00:16:39,280 --> 00:16:42,280
It's not allowed to enter except for
those who are related to it.

265
00:16:43,280 --> 00:16:44,280
We are related to it.

266
00:16:44,280 --> 00:16:45,280
You are related to it.

267
00:16:46,280 --> 00:16:47,280
This is the part where you ride.

268
00:16:47,280 --> 00:16:52,280
I ride it.

269
00:16:52,506 --> 00:16:54,506
Go up the wall!

270
00:16:54,506 --> 00:16:56,506
I don't care how you do it.

271
00:16:56,506 --> 00:16:59,506
It's not like you're going to get wet.

272
00:16:59,506 --> 00:17:01,506
I'm just going to focus on you.

273
00:17:01,506 --> 00:17:03,506
I just realized that.

274
00:17:03,506 --> 00:17:05,506
I'm not that good at this.

275
00:17:05,506 --> 00:17:06,506
I'm not that good at this.

276
00:17:06,506 --> 00:17:07,506
I'm like this.

277
00:17:07,506 --> 00:17:09,506
I'm like this.

278
00:17:10,506 --> 00:17:12,506
You're going to turn upside down
someday.

279
00:17:14,506 --> 00:17:16,506
I can't do it anymore.

280
00:17:16,506 --> 00:17:19,008
I'm going to turn upside down.

281
00:17:20,008 --> 00:17:21,008
Can you walk normally?

282
00:17:22,008 --> 00:17:23,008
I can't walk normally.

283
00:17:25,008 --> 00:17:26,008
I can't move my legs.

284
00:17:30,008 --> 00:17:32,008
I want you to cover me.

285
00:17:35,008 --> 00:17:37,008
I'll do my best today.

286
00:17:38,008 --> 00:17:39,008
I'll go to change my clothes.

287
00:17:39,008 --> 00:17:40,008
Bye bye.

288
00:17:44,666 --> 00:17:46,666
Thank you for watching!

289
00:17:46,864 --> 00:17:51,864
It's finally starting.

290
00:17:51,864 --> 00:17:54,864
30 minutes before the show starts.

291
00:17:54,864 --> 00:17:56,864
It's crazy.

292
00:17:56,864 --> 00:18:00,864
The staff said that it's going to be a
great show.

293
00:18:00,864 --> 00:18:03,864
I was surprised that the venue was so
big.

294
00:18:03,864 --> 00:18:07,864
I didn't expect that there would be a
lot of people.

295
00:18:07,864 --> 00:18:13,864
I wonder what would happen if there were
a lot of PR people.

296
00:18:13,864 --> 00:18:16,864
I think the audience will cry.

297
00:18:16,864 --> 00:18:22,864
So I suggested that the staff should
watch the show first.

298
00:18:22,864 --> 00:18:26,864
But they said no.

299
00:18:26,864 --> 00:18:28,864
They said it's better not to watch it.

300
00:18:28,864 --> 00:18:31,864
They told me to imagine and cry.

301
00:18:31,864 --> 00:18:34,864
I'm already imagining and crying.

302
00:18:34,864 --> 00:18:36,864
When did you do that?

303
00:18:36,864 --> 00:18:38,864
When I did the rehearsal.

304
00:18:38,864 --> 00:18:41,864
When I was on the train home.

305
00:18:41,864 --> 00:18:44,864
I was a crazy person.

306
00:18:44,864 --> 00:18:51,864
I was crying when I saw people on the
train.

307
00:18:51,864 --> 00:18:55,864
I couldn't do that, so I just laughed.

308
00:18:55,864 --> 00:18:58,864
Are you okay?

309
00:18:58,864 --> 00:19:06,864
I was so happy that I dreamed of the day
I could stand on such a stage.

310
00:19:06,864 --> 00:19:13,864
I didn't expect that I could stand on
such a big stage.

311
00:19:13,864 --> 00:19:18,864
It was a dream.

312
00:19:18,864 --> 00:19:26,096
I'm glad that it's coming true.

313
00:19:27,096 --> 00:19:32,096
We've done a lot to fill the gap of 2000
people.

314
00:19:32,096 --> 00:19:38,096
We did a lot of things like live shows,

315
00:19:38,096 --> 00:19:41,096
and we did a street show.

316
00:19:41,096 --> 00:19:45,096
We did a lot of things, but we couldn't
stop.

317
00:19:45,096 --> 00:19:47,096
I think it's because we've experienced
it.

318
00:19:47,096 --> 00:19:58,096
It's not easy to have people come to us.

319
00:19:58,096 --> 00:20:04,096
It's a lot more than that.

320
00:20:04,096 --> 00:20:10,096
I'm sure there are a lot of people who
want to do a live show on a stage called
Maguari Messe.

321
00:20:10,096 --> 00:20:16,096
I'm glad we can do a live show.

322
00:20:16,096 --> 00:20:22,096
I think it's important for everyone to
enjoy it.

323
00:20:22,096 --> 00:20:24,096
I hope you enjoy it.

324
00:20:24,096 --> 00:20:26,096
Smile until the end.

325
00:20:26,096 --> 00:20:28,096
Smile.

326
00:20:28,096 --> 00:20:30,096
Smiling is the most important.

327
00:20:36,096 --> 00:20:38,096
Are you okay?

328
00:20:38,096 --> 00:20:44,096
I'm nervous and excited.

329
00:20:44,096 --> 00:20:52,096
I hope we can do everything we can to
enjoy this stage.

330
00:20:52,096 --> 00:20:56,096
We'll deliver our feelings to you.

331
00:20:56,096 --> 00:20:58,096
Please take it.

332
00:20:58,096 --> 00:21:00,608
We'll do our best.

333
00:21:01,428 --> 00:21:04,408
We're 29 minutes before stage.

334
00:21:06,208 --> 00:21:10,988
Until that time when we finished one
hour

335
00:21:10,988 --> 00:21:16,048
we were like I'm looking forward to it,
and then as soon as we finishing make-up
we were all excited.

336
00:21:21,868 --> 00:21:27,408
We're done until now because we have
rehearsed so much.

337
00:21:27,408 --> 00:21:32,408
We're not going to make it explode in
the next few minutes.

338
00:21:32,408 --> 00:21:35,408
That time is coming.

339
00:21:35,408 --> 00:21:36,408
It's dangerous.

340
00:21:36,408 --> 00:21:40,408
So I want to take every second
seriously.

341
00:21:40,408 --> 00:21:51,072
I want to be on stage so that I can be
blown away from the beginning.

342
00:21:52,072 --> 00:21:55,072
I'm nervous because I'm big.

343
00:21:55,072 --> 00:21:57,072
But I think there are many people who
say,

344
00:21:57,072 --> 00:22:00,072
I think I'm the first time I've come to
make everyone smile.

345
00:22:00,072 --> 00:22:06,072
I want to do my best to catch the heart
of that person.

346
00:22:06,072 --> 00:22:14,272
What prefectures are there in the
Makuhari Messe this time?

347
00:22:14,272 --> 00:22:16,272
What prefecture is it?

348
00:22:16,272 --> 00:22:20,272
It's my hometown, Chiba Prefecture.

349
00:22:20,272 --> 00:22:22,272
Isn't Chiba Prefecture amazing?

350
00:22:22,272 --> 00:22:34,272
I feel like I'm welcoming everyone to
have a one-man live at a big venue in my
hometown.

351
00:22:34,272 --> 00:22:44,272
When I grow up, I want to be like an
idol in Chiba Prefecture, like Yoshikawa
Hiyori.

352
00:22:44,272 --> 00:22:48,272
I want to be the Chiba Prefecture
ambassador.

353
00:22:50,272 --> 00:22:51,272
I want to be.

354
00:22:51,272 --> 00:22:53,272
I think it's good.

355
00:22:53,272 --> 00:23:00,272
I want to welcome everyone to the
Makuhari Messe.

356
00:23:00,272 --> 00:23:10,272
We might be the first group to do a
three-day event at Makuhari Messe.

357
00:23:10,272 --> 00:23:14,272
But it's the first time.

358
00:23:16,272 --> 00:23:18,272
It's the first time only this time.

359
00:23:18,272 --> 00:23:21,272
It's the first time only once.

360
00:23:21,272 --> 00:23:23,272
That's right.

361
00:23:23,272 --> 00:23:25,272
First live.

362
00:23:27,272 --> 00:23:28,272
I'm nervous.

363
00:23:28,272 --> 00:23:30,272
I can't speak.

364
00:23:31,696 --> 00:23:35,696
I'll do my best!

365
00:23:37,824 --> 00:23:39,824
It's about to start!

366
00:23:39,824 --> 00:23:41,824
It's starting!

367
00:23:41,824 --> 00:23:43,824
I'm so excited!

368
00:23:45,824 --> 00:23:47,824
It's amazing.

369
00:23:47,824 --> 00:23:49,824
It's a past site.

370
00:23:49,824 --> 00:23:57,824
I'm looking at the moment when the
penlight is set on the screen.

371
00:23:57,824 --> 00:24:05,824
I'm looking forward to seeing how I
react at that moment.

372
00:24:05,824 --> 00:24:07,824
I'm holding back my tears.

373
00:24:07,824 --> 00:24:09,824
If someone cries, it's over.

374
00:24:09,824 --> 00:24:11,824
You're the one who cries the most.

375
00:24:11,824 --> 00:24:13,824
Julia is a dry person.

376
00:24:13,824 --> 00:24:15,824
If you don't cry, it's safe.

377
00:24:15,824 --> 00:24:21,824
Julia cries and I'm the one who cries
the most.

378
00:24:21,824 --> 00:24:26,824
If you don't cry when Kanamin gets on
stage, everyone will cry.

379
00:24:26,824 --> 00:24:28,824
Then everything depends on Kanamin.

380
00:24:28,824 --> 00:24:30,824
It's okay if everyone cries.

381
00:24:30,824 --> 00:24:32,824
I'll cry.

382
00:24:32,824 --> 00:24:34,824
I'll cry.

383
00:24:34,824 --> 00:24:38,824
I'm sure I'll be moved by the moment.

384
00:24:38,824 --> 00:24:40,824
I can't stop crying.

385
00:24:40,824 --> 00:24:49,824
I heard that the audience was like a big
person.

386
00:24:49,824 --> 00:24:53,472
I can't see that face.

387
00:24:54,472 --> 00:24:56,472
I think the most important thing is to
enjoy.

388
00:24:56,472 --> 00:24:58,472
We've done a lot of rehearsals.

389
00:24:58,472 --> 00:25:00,472
So, we can relax and enjoy.

390
00:25:00,472 --> 00:25:02,472
We'll do our best.

391
00:25:02,472 --> 00:25:04,472
We'll do our best.

392
00:25:04,472 --> 00:25:06,472
Please wait for us.

393
00:25:09,472 --> 00:25:10,472
It's so light.

394
00:25:11,472 --> 00:25:12,472
Are you ready?

395
00:25:12,472 --> 00:25:14,472
I'm scared.

396
00:25:27,258 --> 00:25:32,258
I'm sure you'll be able to find a new
love.

397
00:25:32,258 --> 00:25:38,258
I'm sure you'll be able to find a new
love.

398
00:25:38,258 --> 00:25:43,258
It's gonna be alright.

399
00:25:44,824 --> 00:25:46,824
I'm going to be a member of the group.

400
00:25:47,824 --> 00:25:49,824
Thank you for your cooperation today.

401
00:25:50,824 --> 00:25:52,824
Please wait for us.

402
00:25:53,824 --> 00:25:54,824
Oh, my god.

403
00:25:54,824 --> 00:25:55,824
It's gonna be fun.

404
00:25:55,824 --> 00:25:56,824
It's gonna be cute.

405
00:25:57,824 --> 00:25:58,824
I'm so excited.

406
00:25:58,824 --> 00:25:59,824
I'm so excited.

407
00:26:02,824 --> 00:26:03,824
KANAMI!

408
00:26:03,824 --> 00:26:04,824
NINI-YAH!

409
00:26:04,824 --> 00:26:05,824
ROKO!

410
00:26:05,824 --> 00:26:06,824
MARU-CHAN!

411
00:26:06,824 --> 00:26:07,824
AKI!

412
00:26:07,824 --> 00:26:08,824
YUARI!

413
00:26:08,824 --> 00:26:14,824
Let's go!

414
00:26:17,690 --> 00:26:22,690
Subbed by Dreadopp and Zedopp.

415
00:26:34,224 --> 00:26:37,024
I'm not afraid of giving up

416
00:26:37,024 --> 00:26:40,064
Don't worry about what you say

417
00:26:40,064 --> 00:26:43,184
It's okay to jump over the wall that
can't be broken

418
00:26:43,184 --> 00:26:46,384
Just prove it, we are the strongest

419
00:26:46,384 --> 00:27:04,282
Those blending of two really became a
little bit of performance

420
00:27:04,282 --> 00:27:10,282
I want to share just a little bit of my
feelings with you

421
00:27:10,282 --> 00:27:14,282
There's still a view I've never seen
before

422
00:27:14,282 --> 00:27:19,282
So let's go anywhere

423
00:27:20,760 --> 00:27:22,800
Goodbye, goodbye

424
00:27:22,800 --> 00:27:24,800
Thank you for yesterday

425
00:27:24,800 --> 00:27:28,900
The city after the rain is colored

426
00:27:28,900 --> 00:27:30,900
On the canvas of my damaged heart

427
00:27:30,900 --> 00:27:32,900
I draw fragments of the future

428
00:27:32,900 --> 00:27:36,900
It will guide me

429
00:27:53,018 --> 00:27:58,018
Now is the night, and the reason for my
tears

430
00:27:58,018 --> 00:28:02,018
When I'm lost, I remember right away

431
00:28:02,018 --> 00:28:06,018
Even if it rains, I'll smile

432
00:28:06,018 --> 00:28:10,018
Look, let's go anywhere

433
00:28:10,018 --> 00:28:14,018
Goodbye, goodbye, to me of yesterday

434
00:28:14,018 --> 00:28:18,018
The city lights after the rain are
sparkling

435
00:28:18,018 --> 00:28:22,018
My heart is like a sunny day, the sound
of the rain drops

436
00:28:22,018 --> 00:28:26,018
I play the rainbow piano

437
00:28:26,018 --> 00:28:31,018
Goodbye, goodbye, to me of yesterday

438
00:28:31,018 --> 00:28:35,018
The city lights after the rain are
sparkling

439
00:28:35,018 --> 00:28:39,018
My heart is like a sunny day, the sound
of the rain drops

440
00:28:39,018 --> 00:29:02,018
I wear a rainbow dress

441
00:29:09,018 --> 00:29:17,321
