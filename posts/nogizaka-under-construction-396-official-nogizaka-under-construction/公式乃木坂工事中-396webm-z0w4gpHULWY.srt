1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,898
Thank you for watching.

2
00:00:03,898 --> 00:00:05,898
Protect your seniors, second game battle.

3
00:00:05,898 --> 00:00:07,898
Yes!!!

4
00:00:09,898 --> 00:00:11,898
To avoid punishment for the senior members.

5
00:00:11,898 --> 00:00:24,784
The second half of the second game battle in which paired juniors face off in various competitions.

6
00:00:24,784 --> 00:00:32,044
So far, four third-term seniors have been defeated by four juniors in an ejinky to make them chatter.

7
00:00:32,044 --> 00:00:40,184
A battle of juniors who absolutely cannot be beaten The first showdown of the night is

8
00:00:40,184 --> 00:00:46,004
The one-man challenge.

9
00:00:46,048 --> 00:00:49,048
Soak Dash when you press the camera's self-timer.

10
00:00:49,048 --> 00:00:56,048
If you can get your face in the frame and take a photo within 3 seconds of the shutter release, you've cleared the challenge.

11
00:00:58,048 --> 00:01:04,048
Each time you increase the distance, and if a junior fails, the punishment for the senior is...

12
00:01:04,048 --> 00:01:06,048
A pie in the face.

13
00:01:06,048 --> 00:01:08,048
This is the nostalgic one that changed from this.

14
00:01:08,048 --> 00:01:10,048
I miss it.

15
00:01:10,048 --> 00:01:11,048
Suzuki.

16
00:01:11,048 --> 00:01:12,048
Yes, sir.

17
00:01:12,048 --> 00:01:13,048
I don't want to eat the pie if I can help it.

18
00:01:13,048 --> 00:01:16,048
I'd rather go home with a clean face.

19
00:01:16,048 --> 00:01:18,048
This is my second pie.

20
00:01:18,048 --> 00:01:20,048
At the corps competition.

21
00:01:20,048 --> 00:01:23,048
Mr. Shirara cut the string for fun and I ate the pie.

22
00:01:23,048 --> 00:01:27,048
I'm not playing, I'm doing it for work.

23
00:01:27,048 --> 00:01:28,048
I don't want to do it.

24
00:01:28,048 --> 00:01:29,048
That's right.

25
00:01:29,048 --> 00:01:31,048
He's a senior... with a pie in his face.

26
00:01:31,048 --> 00:01:36,048
Of course, Ayane's face is a national treasure, and she's a legend.

27
00:01:36,048 --> 00:01:38,048
I won't let you pie me.

28
00:01:38,048 --> 00:01:39,048
I won't let you.

29
00:01:39,048 --> 00:01:43,048
That's why even if one of us wins, only one of us can go home clean.

30
00:01:43,048 --> 00:01:44,048
I see.

31
00:01:44,048 --> 00:01:48,048
And now the older Umezawa wins out.

32
00:01:48,048 --> 00:01:53,048
I'll never let you pie the beautiful Umezawa in the face.

33
00:01:53,048 --> 00:01:55,048
I'll run for my life.

34
00:01:55,048 --> 00:01:56,048
I'll run for my life.

35
00:01:56,048 --> 00:01:59,048
I used to be a karate fighter, so I'm afraid I'll get pummeled later.

36
00:01:59,048 --> 00:02:01,048
Scary.

37
00:02:01,048 --> 00:02:02,048
Ume.

38
00:02:02,048 --> 00:02:03,048
Yes, I'm afraid.

39
00:02:03,048 --> 00:02:04,048
I wish you good luck.

40
00:02:04,048 --> 00:02:06,048
I saved Shiraishi-san with this.

41
00:02:06,048 --> 00:02:07,048
I see.

42
00:02:07,048 --> 00:02:10,048
I don't mind if you get your juniors dirty at all.

43
00:02:10,048 --> 00:02:14,048
I'd rather focus on your attitude than your success or failure.

44
00:02:14,048 --> 00:02:17,048
That's the most pressure.

45
00:02:17,048 --> 00:02:19,048
What do you mean, what do you mean?

46
00:02:19,048 --> 00:02:20,048
That's good.

47
00:02:20,048 --> 00:02:23,048
It's totally fine to fail and eat it.

48
00:02:23,048 --> 00:02:26,048
But to take it seriously, that's different.

49
00:02:26,048 --> 00:02:27,048
I see.

50
00:02:27,048 --> 00:02:29,048
Your attitude towards this game.

51
00:02:29,048 --> 00:02:30,048
That's right.

52
00:02:30,048 --> 00:02:32,048
Next senior Kubo, junior Hayakawa...

53
00:02:32,048 --> 00:02:33,048
Yes.

54
00:02:33,048 --> 00:02:34,048
You're a great actress, aren't you?

55
00:02:34,048 --> 00:02:40,048
No, you can't put that kind of cream on a big-girl actress.

56
00:02:40,048 --> 00:02:43,048
No way.

57
00:02:43,048 --> 00:02:45,048
I'll never get this job.

58
00:02:45,048 --> 00:02:47,048
It's a game you can win if you work hard.

59
00:02:47,048 --> 00:02:48,048
That's right.

60
00:02:48,048 --> 00:02:49,048
I'm used to this sort of thing.

61
00:02:49,048 --> 00:02:50,048
Really.

62
00:02:50,048 --> 00:02:53,048
Just the other day, when I went on a trip with Shiori...

63
00:02:53,048 --> 00:02:54,048
I left it there.

64
00:02:54,048 --> 00:02:57,048
We made hearts together.

65
00:02:57,048 --> 00:03:00,048
But one concern is that we're too close.

66
00:03:00,048 --> 00:03:04,048
It's not like she's just going to give up.

67
00:03:04,048 --> 00:03:06,048
It's better to eat them.

68
00:03:06,048 --> 00:03:07,048
Attitude is important.

69
00:03:07,048 --> 00:03:09,048
Attitude is important too.

70
00:03:09,048 --> 00:03:13,048
How about you, senpai Yoda, junior Iki?

71
00:03:13,048 --> 00:03:19,048
Yes, I'll stand up for myself and not let my senpai stand up for himself.

72
00:03:19,048 --> 00:03:20,048
I see.

73
00:03:20,048 --> 00:03:22,048
I just imitated Masami Nagasawa.

74
00:03:22,048 --> 00:03:24,048
Indeed.

75
00:03:24,048 --> 00:03:25,048
You're right.

76
00:03:25,048 --> 00:03:27,048
We haven't talked like that at night either.

77
00:03:27,048 --> 00:03:29,048
I've talked about it a bit.

78
00:03:29,048 --> 00:03:31,048
You know, even at night it's the scariest thing in the world.

79
00:03:31,048 --> 00:03:34,048
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

80
00:03:34,048 --> 00:03:36,048
I want you to do your best.

81
00:03:36,048 --> 00:03:37,048
You can do it, Iki.

82
00:03:37,048 --> 00:03:39,048
Basically, I'm scared of the third term.

83
00:03:39,048 --> 00:03:42,048
Third term's been through this before.

84
00:03:42,048 --> 00:03:43,048
I'm scared.

85
00:03:43,048 --> 00:03:44,048
Like this.

86
00:03:44,048 --> 00:03:46,048
The result of rock-paper-scissors-scissors.

87
00:03:46,048 --> 00:03:49,048
The order is chosen by the winners.

88
00:03:51,048 --> 00:03:53,048
The first one up is Iki, a fellow student.

89
00:03:53,048 --> 00:03:57,048
I started with Ioki, but he's at 5 metres now.

90
00:03:57,048 --> 00:04:01,048
I have to move at least one square at the beginning.

91
00:04:01,048 --> 00:04:02,048
4 memory

92
00:04:02,048 --> 00:04:03,048
Suddenly...

93
00:04:03,048 --> 00:04:04,048
Oh, my God.

94
00:04:04,048 --> 00:04:05,048
It's all right.

95
00:04:05,048 --> 00:04:06,048
Four out of nowhere.

96
00:04:06,048 --> 00:04:07,048
It's 60 centimetres down.

97
00:04:07,048 --> 00:04:10,048
And I'll be here to support you if you go over the edge.

98
00:04:10,048 --> 00:04:12,048
I'll be careful.

99
00:04:12,048 --> 00:04:13,048
Let's go.

100
00:04:13,048 --> 00:04:14,048
Here we go.

101
00:04:14,048 --> 00:04:19,194
Try your hand at the selfie challenge.

102
00:04:19,194 --> 00:04:21,194
You've got time!

103
00:04:21,194 --> 00:04:22,754
I've got plenty of time.

104
00:04:22,754 --> 00:04:24,194
I've got time.

105
00:04:24,194 --> 00:04:25,194
Photo's up.

106
00:04:25,194 --> 00:04:27,194
Oh, you can afford it.

107
00:04:27,194 --> 00:04:28,194
She's cute.

108
00:04:28,194 --> 00:04:29,194
It's totally fine.

109
00:04:29,194 --> 00:04:31,194
If you want, we could go right past it.

110
00:04:31,194 --> 00:04:32,194
Hey...

111
00:04:32,194 --> 00:04:35,194
Next is fourth-year student Sato's challenge.

112
00:04:35,194 --> 00:04:37,194
Are you slow?

113
00:04:37,194 --> 00:04:38,194
I'm slow, probably.

114
00:04:38,194 --> 00:04:41,194
I'm about third or fourth from the bottom out of all of you.

115
00:04:41,194 --> 00:04:42,194
Oh, no. Suzuki's in trouble.

116
00:04:42,194 --> 00:04:44,194
But I believe in you. I'll be fine.

117
00:04:44,194 --> 00:04:45,194
I'll be fine.

118
00:04:45,194 --> 00:04:46,194
You'll be fine.

119
00:04:46,194 --> 00:04:47,194
I'm fine.

120
00:04:47,194 --> 00:04:48,194
Until the third eye.

121
00:04:48,194 --> 00:04:49,194
There's plenty of room.

122
00:04:49,194 --> 00:04:51,194
Hirasato, try 45 cm lower.

123
00:04:51,194 --> 00:04:52,194
Shall we?

124
00:04:52,194 --> 00:04:54,194
Okay, then.

125
00:04:54,194 --> 00:04:56,194
Last-minute selfie challenge!

126
00:04:56,194 --> 00:04:58,194
[Hajime Shacho's ending]

127
00:04:58,426 --> 00:05:06,226
I've got too much leeway, I'm coming out too fast.

128
00:05:06,226 --> 00:05:09,226
Aaah!

129
00:05:09,906 --> 00:05:17,546
I'm so embarrassed that I'm in the picture.

130
00:05:17,546 --> 00:05:26,266
I wonder if fishing all the time will not slip away...
て

131
00:05:26,266 --> 00:05:27,226
Aaah!

132
00:05:27,226 --> 00:05:28,226
I can afford it!

133
00:05:28,226 --> 00:05:30,394
It's difficult, isn't it?

134
00:05:30,394 --> 00:05:36,114
Yamashita came out in plenty of time, too.

135
00:05:36,114 --> 00:05:40,594
I'm sure they'll come out more and more.

136
00:05:40,594 --> 00:05:43,994
They'll come out more and more.

137
00:05:43,994 --> 00:05:50,994
The last of the first round is the late Sugawara. Go ahead, attack or wait and see.

138
00:05:50,994 --> 00:06:00,194
But if you really go for it, you'll be fine.

139
00:06:00,194 --> 00:06:09,874
Four by 47 meters, 25 centimeters, 7 meters and 25 inches... that's a hell of a long way.
さあねはい気をつけてくださいこの辺でボンミスで落とすってありえないですから

140
00:06:09,874 --> 00:06:15,634
It's impossible, fate is watching our stance.

141
00:06:15,634 --> 00:06:21,314
Let's go for the last-minute selfie challenge.

142
00:06:21,314 --> 00:06:24,314
Ha-ha-ha.

143
00:06:24,890 --> 00:06:31,390
It's not sticking out now, it's coming out.

144
00:06:31,390 --> 00:06:34,230
Let's take a look at the photo.

145
00:06:35,950 --> 00:06:42,110
It's hiding the whole rock. Yamashita's come out all right.

146
00:06:42,110 --> 00:06:54,110
After this, all the members who carefully tried to bowl the second lap with strength and distance were successful!
そして勝負は10メートル越えの3巡目に突入

147
00:06:54,192 --> 00:06:57,192
Fifth-year student Iki's choice...

148
00:06:57,192 --> 00:06:59,192
What should we do?

149
00:06:59,192 --> 00:07:01,192
Attack or defend?

150
00:07:01,192 --> 00:07:03,192
Defend?

151
00:07:03,192 --> 00:07:05,192
Defend?

152
00:07:05,192 --> 00:07:07,192
Frazee, but that's a weak statement.

153
00:07:07,192 --> 00:07:09,192
Defend.

154
00:07:09,192 --> 00:07:11,192
Let's go on the offensive.

155
00:07:11,192 --> 00:07:13,192
Four.

156
00:07:13,192 --> 00:07:15,192
Ten metres, 70 centimetres.

157
00:07:15,192 --> 00:07:17,192
That's pretty good.

158
00:07:17,192 --> 00:07:21,536
Yoshihiko Ioki, take a selfie challenge.

159
00:07:21,536 --> 00:07:27,536
No, thank you. It's getting pretty close.

160
00:07:27,536 --> 00:07:31,976
It's getting good. Let's see the photos.

161
00:07:31,976 --> 00:07:33,976
That's pretty close.

162
00:07:33,976 --> 00:07:34,976
Oh, it's from around here.

163
00:07:34,976 --> 00:07:37,976
I'm pretty close to the edge, as far as I'm concerned.

164
00:07:37,976 --> 00:07:40,976
The timing is faster than I thought it would be.

165
00:07:40,976 --> 00:07:43,976
Well, this is where it starts.

166
00:07:43,976 --> 00:07:45,976
Here they come!

167
00:07:45,976 --> 00:07:52,976
Next, Sato, who's not sure about his leg strength, chose the 30 cm plus for protection.

168
00:07:52,976 --> 00:07:55,976
Let's check the photos.

169
00:07:55,976 --> 00:08:00,528
I managed to get it in the frame, just in time.

170
00:08:00,528 --> 00:08:02,528
This is how it's going to be.

171
00:08:02,528 --> 00:08:04,528
Hayakawa's fast.

172
00:08:04,528 --> 00:08:06,528
Why Hayakawa?

173
00:08:06,528 --> 00:08:08,528
Because he's fast.

174
00:08:08,528 --> 00:08:10,528
You're so fast, Hayakawa!

175
00:08:10,528 --> 00:08:12,528
Try it with plus one memory.

176
00:08:14,528 --> 00:08:16,528
Succeed without fail.

177
00:08:16,528 --> 00:08:18,528
Put pressure on the rest of the field.

178
00:08:18,528 --> 00:08:20,528
Seriously.

179
00:08:20,528 --> 00:08:22,528
And the third and final round is Sugawara.

180
00:08:22,528 --> 00:08:24,528
Come on, Shogo, I'm nervous.

181
00:08:24,528 --> 00:08:26,528
I really want to attack, but...

182
00:08:26,528 --> 00:08:28,528
To save Umezawa-san's face.

183
00:08:28,528 --> 00:08:30,528
But I don't know...

184
00:08:30,528 --> 00:08:32,528
Maybe they'll think you're trying to be aggressive.

185
00:08:34,528 --> 00:08:36,528
Even if it doesn't work, it's okay.

186
00:08:36,528 --> 00:08:38,528
Can I ask your opinion?

187
00:08:38,528 --> 00:08:40,528
You don't have to ask me for my opinion.

188
00:08:40,528 --> 00:08:42,528
I'm scared.

189
00:08:42,528 --> 00:08:44,528
I see what you mean.

190
00:08:44,528 --> 00:08:46,528
But that's...

191
00:08:46,528 --> 00:08:48,528
It's in anticipation of what's to come.

192
00:08:48,528 --> 00:08:50,528
I've been hungry since I sat here.

193
00:08:50,528 --> 00:08:52,528
I'm going to start my fifth term.

194
00:08:52,528 --> 00:08:54,528
They'll think for themselves.

195
00:08:54,528 --> 00:08:56,528
They'll act for Nogizaka on their own.

196
00:08:56,528 --> 00:08:58,528
I'm not here to listen to my seniors' opinions.

197
00:08:58,528 --> 00:09:00,528
I'm going with my own opinion.

198
00:09:00,528 --> 00:09:02,528
Yes, sir.

199
00:09:02,528 --> 00:09:04,528
Second place.

200
00:09:04,528 --> 00:09:06,528
Let's go for second place.

201
00:09:06,528 --> 00:09:08,528
11 metres, 45 centimetres.

202
00:09:08,528 --> 00:09:10,528
That's great.

203
00:09:10,528 --> 00:09:12,528
Here we go.

204
00:09:12,528 --> 00:09:16,346
Here you go.

205
00:09:16,346 --> 00:09:18,346
That's fast.

206
00:09:20,192 --> 00:09:22,192
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

207
00:09:22,192 --> 00:09:23,192
I think I'm good.

208
00:09:23,192 --> 00:09:24,192
I think it looks good.

209
00:09:24,192 --> 00:09:25,192
Let's see some pictures.

210
00:09:26,192 --> 00:09:27,192
Oh, lee.

211
00:09:28,192 --> 00:09:29,192
In the middle.

212
00:09:29,192 --> 00:09:31,192
That's amazing.

213
00:09:32,192 --> 00:09:35,192
But it's not good if it doesn't show up when you run in like this.

214
00:09:35,192 --> 00:09:36,192
You have to go in like this.

215
00:09:36,192 --> 00:09:38,192
It's the face side, so it won't go in there.

216
00:09:38,192 --> 00:09:39,192
That's right.

217
00:09:39,192 --> 00:09:40,192
Maybe...

218
00:09:40,192 --> 00:09:42,192
I'll set a world record in the short distance.

219
00:09:42,192 --> 00:09:43,192
Right here.

220
00:09:43,192 --> 00:09:45,192
I'll find myself doing 50 metres or something.

221
00:09:45,192 --> 00:09:47,472
Send it into the rainy season..."

222
00:09:47,472 --> 00:09:52,472
The selfie challenge has already attracted 40 participants

223
00:09:52,472 --> 00:09:57,472
Iyoki added 2 memory 30 cm.

224
00:09:57,472 --> 00:10:02,472
11 metres and 75 centimetres.

225
00:10:02,472 --> 00:10:06,472
Sato was just barely there earlier.

226
00:10:06,472 --> 00:10:10,472
Sato, wanting to hang on, tries an extra 1 memory.

227
00:10:10,472 --> 00:10:12,472
Let's go! 11 metres, 90 centimetres!

228
00:10:12,472 --> 00:10:16,016
Let's go for the last-minute selfie challenge!

229
00:10:17,016 --> 00:10:18,016
He's so cute!

230
00:10:19,016 --> 00:10:21,016
Go for it! I can do it, I can do it, I can do it.

231
00:10:21,016 --> 00:10:23,802
How's it going!

232
00:10:23,802 --> 00:10:25,802
No, you got it!

233
00:10:25,802 --> 00:10:27,802
What's Sato's result?

234
00:10:27,802 --> 00:10:29,802
Let's check the photos.

235
00:10:29,802 --> 00:10:31,802
Wow!

236
00:10:31,802 --> 00:10:33,802
There it is!

237
00:10:33,802 --> 00:10:35,802
This one's not in.

238
00:10:35,802 --> 00:10:37,802
It's not in!

239
00:10:37,802 --> 00:10:39,802
Wow!

240
00:10:40,920 --> 00:10:43,920
So that's a pie in senior Suzuki's face.

241
00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:46,920
Just say something to Suzuki.

242
00:10:46,920 --> 00:10:48,920
I'm sorry, sir.

243
00:10:48,920 --> 00:10:49,920
Not at all.

244
00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:51,920
Let's go... to Suzuki.

245
00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:52,920
Three seconds.

246
00:10:52,920 --> 00:10:54,920
Three, two, one.

247
00:10:54,920 --> 00:10:55,920
Three, two, one.

248
00:10:58,920 --> 00:10:59,920
Strong.

249
00:10:59,920 --> 00:11:00,920
Harder.

250
00:11:00,920 --> 00:11:09,264
Harder.

251
00:11:09,264 --> 00:11:11,264
Not too hard?

252
00:11:11,264 --> 00:11:13,264
No, it's fine.

253
00:11:21,850 --> 00:11:25,850
Look at you, you're so beautiful.

254
00:11:25,850 --> 00:11:28,850
Who's that?

255
00:11:28,850 --> 00:11:30,850
Not too hard?

256
00:11:30,850 --> 00:11:33,850
I thought I'd lose my nose.

257
00:11:33,850 --> 00:11:35,850
Punch it.

258
00:11:35,850 --> 00:11:37,850
I got hit a little hard, didn't I?

259
00:11:37,850 --> 00:11:40,464
But you've already done your best.

260
00:11:40,464 --> 00:11:50,864
Only one of the juniors survived, so they might be a bit scared now, the pies are getting more powerful too.

261
00:11:50,864 --> 00:11:58,164
Only three left, one senior to be saved, and here we go.

262
00:11:58,164 --> 00:12:03,408
Aaaaaaah! Cleared some 12 metres and 5 centimetres.

263
00:12:04,408 --> 00:12:06,408
What about Sugawara?

264
00:12:06,408 --> 00:12:08,408
How's Sugawara?

265
00:12:08,408 --> 00:12:11,408
He's improved his record by 15 centimetres!

266
00:12:11,408 --> 00:12:13,408
Amazing! Daikichi!

267
00:12:13,408 --> 00:12:15,408
Great luck!

268
00:12:16,408 --> 00:12:18,408
50 metres from here.

269
00:12:18,408 --> 00:12:21,408
Iyoki is on the offensive, plus two memories.

270
00:12:21,408 --> 00:12:23,408
You'd better screw your face in at the end.

271
00:12:23,408 --> 00:12:25,408
I think it's that game now.

272
00:12:25,408 --> 00:12:28,408
Here's your last-minute one-man challenge.

273
00:12:28,408 --> 00:12:30,408
Go for it.

274
00:12:30,408 --> 00:12:32,408
Go for it.

275
00:12:32,408 --> 00:12:34,408
Whoa!

276
00:12:34,408 --> 00:12:36,408
Oh!

277
00:12:36,408 --> 00:12:37,408
Oh, oh, good, it's not in yet.

278
00:12:37,466 --> 00:12:40,466
No, the face, the one you just put in, it's not in there.

279
00:12:40,466 --> 00:12:41,466
That was a second ago.

280
00:12:41,466 --> 00:12:46,466
It was a while ago, but I don't know if it's in there.

281
00:12:46,466 --> 00:12:47,466
I don't know.

282
00:12:47,466 --> 00:12:57,466
It's in, it's in, it's in, it's in, it's in, it's in, it's in.

283
00:12:57,466 --> 00:12:58,466
Oh, my God!

284
00:12:58,466 --> 00:13:01,466
It's just about to go in.

285
00:13:01,466 --> 00:13:02,466
Bravo!

286
00:13:02,466 --> 00:13:05,466
Bravo, bravo, bravo!

287
00:13:05,466 --> 00:13:08,466
I think we've put a bit of pressure on the last two.

288
00:13:08,466 --> 00:13:11,466
Suzuki's having fun.

289
00:13:11,466 --> 00:13:12,466
Yes, it is.

290
00:13:12,466 --> 00:13:14,466
Why is it fun?

291
00:13:14,466 --> 00:13:16,466
What do we do, Hayakawa?

292
00:13:16,466 --> 00:13:17,466
First place.

293
00:13:17,466 --> 00:13:19,466
I guess it's a toss-up.

294
00:13:19,466 --> 00:13:21,466
Even first place could be bad... this time.

295
00:13:21,466 --> 00:13:24,466
Here's your last-minute selfie challenge!

296
00:13:24,466 --> 00:13:27,226
Go for it, go for it!

297
00:13:27,226 --> 00:13:29,568
Shut up. Hey.

298
00:13:29,568 --> 00:13:31,568
How's it going? That was close.

299
00:13:31,568 --> 00:13:33,568
Is it in? I think it's gone.

300
00:13:33,568 --> 00:13:35,568
If not, I'm gonna eat a Kubo.

301
00:13:35,568 --> 00:13:37,568
Is it in my face?

302
00:13:37,568 --> 00:13:39,568
It's in!

303
00:13:39,568 --> 00:13:41,568
Oh, my God!

304
00:13:41,568 --> 00:13:43,568
That's great.

305
00:13:43,568 --> 00:13:45,568
It's really close.

306
00:13:45,568 --> 00:13:47,568
That's not good.

307
00:13:47,568 --> 00:13:49,568
If you get it in next time, you win!

308
00:13:49,568 --> 00:13:51,568
That's amazing.

309
00:13:51,568 --> 00:13:53,568
To attack or not to attack?

310
00:13:53,568 --> 00:13:55,568
One or two questions won't make much difference.

311
00:13:55,568 --> 00:13:57,568
Amazing!

312
00:13:57,568 --> 00:13:59,568
Utsu and Uiran were so scary!

313
00:14:02,416 --> 00:14:08,416
Sugawara, under pressure from Umezawa, chose the plus two scale of victory.

314
00:14:08,416 --> 00:14:11,416
Use your own timing!

315
00:14:11,416 --> 00:14:13,416
Last-minute selfie challenge!

316
00:14:13,416 --> 00:14:15,416
Sugawara, go ahead.

317
00:14:17,416 --> 00:14:19,416
Go for it, go for it!

318
00:14:19,416 --> 00:14:21,416
I can do it, I can do it, I can do it.

319
00:14:21,416 --> 00:14:23,416
Can you do it?

320
00:14:24,186 --> 00:14:26,186
Maybe a little too subtle.

321
00:14:26,186 --> 00:14:29,186
Let's see the photos.

322
00:14:29,186 --> 00:14:31,186
Is it in?

323
00:14:32,186 --> 00:14:34,186
Sugawara's ready for a fight.

324
00:14:34,186 --> 00:14:37,186
Can he save his senior, Umezawa?

325
00:14:37,186 --> 00:14:38,186
Is it in?

326
00:14:38,186 --> 00:14:40,186
Oh, no!

327
00:14:40,186 --> 00:14:42,186
It's not in!

328
00:14:42,186 --> 00:14:44,186
I'm chattering like a baby!

329
00:14:44,186 --> 00:14:45,984
You're out.

330
00:14:46,984 --> 00:14:49,984
Come on, Ume, you're gonna get your pie.

331
00:14:49,984 --> 00:14:50,984
Let's do it.

332
00:14:50,984 --> 00:14:52,984
Just one last thing, senpai.

333
00:14:52,984 --> 00:14:53,984
I'm sorry.

334
00:14:53,984 --> 00:14:55,984
Get down on your knees.

335
00:14:55,984 --> 00:14:56,984
That was cool.

336
00:14:56,984 --> 00:14:58,984
That was cool. Ume, it's all right.

337
00:14:58,984 --> 00:14:59,984
It's all right.

338
00:14:59,984 --> 00:15:00,984
Come on, let's go.

339
00:15:00,984 --> 00:15:05,984
Pie, three, two, one, go ahead.

340
00:15:06,984 --> 00:15:07,984
Wow.

341
00:15:07,984 --> 00:15:08,984
Yoo-hoo!

342
00:15:09,594 --> 00:15:11,594
Ha-ha-ha-ha.

343
00:15:11,694 --> 00:15:13,694
Ooooh, that hurt!

344
00:15:13,694 --> 00:15:15,434
It's painful. Let me take it off for you.

345
00:15:15,634 --> 00:15:17,634
Hey, then...

346
00:15:17,634 --> 00:15:19,634
Haaaa...

347
00:15:19,634 --> 00:15:21,634
[All] Huh?

348
00:15:21,634 --> 00:15:23,334
[All] Wow!

349
00:15:23,904 --> 00:15:26,904
Oh, my God, they're all buried in the beauty.

350
00:15:26,904 --> 00:15:28,904
Oh, my gosh.

351
00:15:28,904 --> 00:15:30,904
That's a lot of swooning.

352
00:15:30,904 --> 00:15:32,904
Yes, it's like we're doing a variety show.

353
00:15:32,904 --> 00:15:34,904
I feel like I'm doing a variety show.

354
00:15:34,904 --> 00:15:35,904
That's cool.

355
00:15:35,904 --> 00:15:37,904
Now that's a great comment.

356
00:15:37,904 --> 00:15:38,904
That's great.

357
00:15:38,904 --> 00:15:40,904
Finally, a fight.

358
00:15:40,904 --> 00:15:43,904
Who can defend their seniors?

359
00:15:44,904 --> 00:15:46,904
It's all down to the wire from here.

360
00:15:46,904 --> 00:15:50,904
Ioki's going for 12 metres 80.

361
00:15:50,904 --> 00:15:51,904
Come on, Ioki.

362
00:15:51,904 --> 00:15:52,904
Go for it!

363
00:15:52,904 --> 00:15:53,904
Last-minute selfie challenge

364
00:15:53,904 --> 00:15:55,904
Take your own timing!

365
00:15:55,904 --> 00:15:56,904
Here you go.

366
00:15:58,696 --> 00:16:00,696
Go, go, go!

367
00:16:00,696 --> 00:16:01,696
That was quick.

368
00:16:01,696 --> 00:16:03,696
No, no, no, not fast enough.

369
00:16:03,696 --> 00:16:05,696
You did it once.

370
00:16:05,696 --> 00:16:07,696
It's not safe.

371
00:16:07,696 --> 00:16:10,696
From my vantage point, it looks like you've got plenty of time.

372
00:16:10,696 --> 00:16:11,696
You look comfortable.

373
00:16:11,696 --> 00:16:13,696
How do you feel about it? Do you feel like you're ready?

374
00:16:13,696 --> 00:16:15,696
I don't know.

375
00:16:15,696 --> 00:16:17,696
If this is out, Kubo is safe.

376
00:16:17,696 --> 00:16:19,696
I wonder if it was in there.

377
00:16:19,696 --> 00:16:21,696
Let's take a look at the photos.

378
00:16:21,696 --> 00:16:23,696
Wow!

379
00:16:23,696 --> 00:16:25,696
Out!

380
00:16:26,074 --> 00:16:31,474
Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

381
00:16:31,474 --> 00:16:39,794
Thank you for making it this far.

382
00:16:39,794 --> 00:16:45,634
I'd better close my eyes, but I don't want to keep them open.

383
00:16:45,634 --> 00:16:53,794
It's the first time I've ever done this... and I'm a senior now... but the sun is shining, so I'll have to get rid of Pichler.

384
00:16:53,794 --> 00:17:01,054
Now then, Brother Peeser, one back.

385
00:17:01,054 --> 00:17:06,194
Oh, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah!

386
00:17:06,194 --> 00:17:06,426
Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha...

387
00:17:06,426 --> 00:17:08,426
My tummy's full of pies.

388
00:17:08,426 --> 00:17:10,426
It's gone a bit high up.

389
00:17:10,426 --> 00:17:11,426
Take it off for him.

390
00:17:11,426 --> 00:17:12,426
Look, look...

391
00:17:12,426 --> 00:17:14,426
It's like this at the bottom.

392
00:17:16,426 --> 00:17:17,426
Right here, below the face.

393
00:17:17,426 --> 00:17:18,426
It's beautiful.

394
00:17:18,426 --> 00:17:20,426
It's totally visible.

395
00:17:20,426 --> 00:17:22,426
It's all right. It's all right.

396
00:17:26,360 --> 00:17:35,840
How's she looking?

397
00:17:35,840 --> 00:17:43,600
You're making a funny face, but I don't know, I want to take a picture of it. 
いねそして久保

398
00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:47,360
Safety!

399
00:17:47,360 --> 00:17:54,360
I told you she's a Tiger actress... like that...

400
00:17:54,360 --> 00:18:00,480
Let's continue with the game.

401
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:03,480
Oh, yeah...

402
00:18:03,480 --> 00:18:13,408
The junior members are on a mission to save Akimoto, who's trapped in a giant balloon box.

403
00:18:13,408 --> 00:18:20,668
If they can get the balloons into the bucket three metres away without dropping them with the wind from the hairdryer, they'll be airborne for a moment.
トップ

404
00:18:20,668 --> 00:18:30,288
If the giant balloon doesn't break by the end of the four members' challenge, Akimoto will be rescued!
挑戦するのはこちらの4人

405
00:18:30,288 --> 00:18:37,968
Will you work together to complete the mission?
ということで真夏さんを風船の餌食にしちゃあまずいですよ

406
00:18:37,968 --> 00:18:43,728
He's the captain's senior, and he's sacrificed his life for us. We won't let it break.

407
00:18:43,728 --> 00:18:51,728
Please... and Hayashi... we'll all work together... and just now... it was a battle... but... we'll also be working together.
もチームワークして

408
00:18:51,728 --> 00:18:57,688
I'd like Manatsu-san to witness the bond between the fourth term students.

409
00:18:57,688 --> 00:19:01,968
Don't worry, Kuromi's here.

410
00:19:01,968 --> 00:19:08,968
Kuromi's in trouble, if she fails, leave it to Manatsu-san.

411
00:19:08,968 --> 00:19:11,968
Will she be all right?

412
00:19:11,968 --> 00:19:29,146
Protect the captain from the giant balloon.
さあそれじゃいきましょう1人目柴田チャレンジスタート

413
00:19:29,146 --> 00:19:31,146
I can do it, I can do it, I can do it...

414
00:19:31,146 --> 00:19:33,146
Go for it!

415
00:19:33,146 --> 00:19:35,146
Go, go, go!

416
00:19:35,146 --> 00:19:37,146
Uraa, I can't get in!

417
00:19:37,456 --> 00:19:41,456
Akimoto's balloon's getting bigger and bigger.

418
00:19:41,456 --> 00:19:44,456
Oh, no!

419
00:19:44,456 --> 00:19:46,456
It's in!

420
00:19:46,456 --> 00:19:48,456
It's stopped!

421
00:19:48,456 --> 00:19:50,456
It's pretty inflated.

422
00:19:50,456 --> 00:19:52,456
It's stopped now.

423
00:19:52,456 --> 00:19:53,456
It's inflating quite a bit, isn't it?

424
00:19:53,456 --> 00:19:55,456
That's pretty fast.

425
00:19:55,456 --> 00:19:57,456
A little slow.

426
00:19:57,456 --> 00:19:59,456
It's hard to fine-tune.

427
00:19:59,456 --> 00:20:00,456
Yes, it is.

428
00:20:00,456 --> 00:20:01,456
I can't get it in.

429
00:20:01,456 --> 00:20:02,456
I can't get it in.

430
00:20:02,456 --> 00:20:03,456
It's too slow.

431
00:20:03,456 --> 00:20:05,456
You've done a lot of work on the balloons.

432
00:20:05,456 --> 00:20:07,456
I'm so scared.

433
00:20:07,456 --> 00:20:09,456
Yeah, very scary.

434
00:20:09,456 --> 00:20:11,456
Holiday!

435
00:20:11,456 --> 00:20:14,456
I'm scared... that's Holiday!

436
00:20:15,456 --> 00:20:19,456
Now let's see if we can recover the Yakubo.

437
00:20:19,456 --> 00:20:21,456
Let the challenge begin!

438
00:20:21,456 --> 00:20:24,456
Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go!

439
00:20:24,456 --> 00:20:26,456
Go, go, go, go, go, go!

440
00:20:26,456 --> 00:20:28,456
Good, good, good.

441
00:20:28,456 --> 00:20:29,274
Oh!

442
00:20:29,274 --> 00:20:39,738
Huihui.

443
00:20:30,154 --> 00:20:31,994
That's great.

444
00:20:34,774 --> 00:20:39,738
Kick it

445
00:20:39,738 --> 00:20:41,738
Wow, you dropped it!

446
00:20:41,738 --> 00:20:43,738
That's a time-loss.

447
00:20:43,738 --> 00:20:45,738
Oh, no, no, no!

448
00:20:45,738 --> 00:20:47,738
It's pretty inflated.

449
00:20:47,738 --> 00:20:49,738
The balloon's in trouble.

450
00:20:49,738 --> 00:20:51,738
Come on!

451
00:20:51,738 --> 00:20:53,738
Come on!

452
00:20:53,738 --> 00:20:55,738
The fallout's pretty bad.

453
00:20:55,738 --> 00:20:57,738
It's okay, it's okay.

454
00:20:57,738 --> 00:20:59,738
It's okay, it's okay.

455
00:21:00,064 --> 00:21:10,864
In, in, in, in, in, in, in, in.

456
00:21:10,864 --> 00:21:16,496
I'm in, I'm in, I'm in.

457
00:21:16,496 --> 00:21:20,496
Oh, man, I thought it was going in pretty good, but it came off.

458
00:21:20,496 --> 00:21:25,496
I can't believe how panicky he gets when he takes it off.

459
00:21:25,496 --> 00:21:28,496
When he came to get it, he was like a cartoon.

460
00:21:28,496 --> 00:21:29,496
That's amazing.

461
00:21:29,496 --> 00:21:32,496
Do you guys know how bad this is?

462
00:21:32,496 --> 00:21:37,496
Surprisingly, when everyone's playing the game, they're so focused.

463
00:21:38,496 --> 00:21:41,496
The third in a last-ditch fight is Kuromi.

464
00:21:41,496 --> 00:21:45,496
Kuromi's really working hard.

465
00:21:45,496 --> 00:21:47,496
I'm good at this.

466
00:21:47,496 --> 00:21:49,496
Don't worry, I'll take care of it.

467
00:21:49,496 --> 00:21:52,496
You're so determined.

468
00:21:52,496 --> 00:21:54,496
Leave it to me.

469
00:21:54,496 --> 00:21:57,496
Let's start the third.

470
00:21:57,496 --> 00:21:59,496
Go, go, go, go!

471
00:21:59,496 --> 00:22:01,496
It's okay, it's okay, it's okay.

472
00:22:01,496 --> 00:22:03,496
It's okay, it's okay, it's okay.

473
00:22:03,496 --> 00:22:07,496
You, you, you, you.

474
00:22:08,730 --> 00:22:20,850
Quick, quick, quick, quick, quick, quick. Good job, good job.

475
00:22:20,850 --> 00:22:22,330
Good, good, good.

476
00:22:22,330 --> 00:22:23,830
Amazing.

477
00:22:23,830 --> 00:22:25,530
You survived, Akimoto.

478
00:22:25,530 --> 00:22:26,530
You're going to live!

479
00:22:26,530 --> 00:22:28,150
It might...

480
00:22:28,150 --> 00:22:29,450
Come on, we're moving too fast.

481
00:22:29,450 --> 00:22:30,450
We don't have much time.

482
00:22:30,450 --> 00:22:33,210
It's getting cold.

483
00:22:33,210 --> 00:22:36,130
Why don't you use a hairdryer to warm it up?

484
00:22:36,130 --> 00:22:45,248
Can the giant balloon save Akimoto?

485
00:22:46,248 --> 00:22:47,248
I can do it! I can do it!

486
00:22:47,248 --> 00:22:50,248
The Anka Hayashi Challenge is about to begin!

487
00:22:50,248 --> 00:22:53,248
Go, go, go!

488
00:22:53,248 --> 00:22:59,248
I'm here, I'm here, I'm cracking, I'm cracking!

489
00:23:00,248 --> 00:23:04,248
I'm down, I'm down, I'm down, I'm down, I'm down, I'm down!

490
00:23:06,248 --> 00:23:12,248
Oh no, oh no, it's cracking already!

491
00:23:12,248 --> 00:23:15,248
The fall is already halfway full

492
00:23:19,192 --> 00:23:22,192
It's too big!

493
00:23:22,192 --> 00:23:25,192
It's too big!

494
00:23:27,192 --> 00:23:29,192
You scared me!

495
00:23:29,192 --> 00:23:31,192
That's too big!

496
00:23:31,192 --> 00:23:33,192
Wow!

497
00:23:33,192 --> 00:23:35,192
Oh, my God.

498
00:23:35,192 --> 00:23:37,192
Ew! Ew!

499
00:23:37,192 --> 00:23:39,192
Oh, my God.

500
00:23:41,192 --> 00:23:43,192
That's too big.

501
00:23:43,192 --> 00:23:45,192
Explosion sound too big.

502
00:23:45,192 --> 00:23:46,960
Explosion sound.

503
00:23:47,960 --> 00:23:49,960
How many times have you dropped the forest?

504
00:23:49,960 --> 00:23:51,960
What are you doing?

505
00:23:51,960 --> 00:23:53,960
Hayashi, you're not very good at this!

506
00:23:53,960 --> 00:23:55,960
I'm just doing it right. I'm really serious.

507
00:23:55,960 --> 00:23:57,960
I'm not doing it!

508
00:23:57,960 --> 00:23:59,960
It's amazing how everyone seems to be against you.

509
00:24:01,960 --> 00:24:03,960
You're so bad at this!

510
00:24:03,960 --> 00:24:05,960
Now you're the one who got Akimoto killed.

511
00:24:05,960 --> 00:24:07,960
Akimoto was high, wasn't he?

512
00:24:07,960 --> 00:24:09,960
I'm sorry.

513
00:24:09,960 --> 00:24:11,960
Fifty-five.

514
00:24:11,960 --> 00:24:13,960
But look, no, no, no, Hayashi's here now.

515
00:24:13,960 --> 00:24:15,960
No, no, no.

516
00:24:15,960 --> 00:24:17,960
He's only stopped because he's cracked.

517
00:24:17,960 --> 00:24:19,960
Why are these four funny?

518
00:24:19,960 --> 00:24:21,960
They're funny.

519
00:24:21,960 --> 00:24:23,960
They're the four of them.

520
00:24:23,960 --> 00:24:25,960
And they don't really feel sorry for Akimoto.

521
00:24:25,960 --> 00:24:27,960
It's true.

522
00:24:27,960 --> 00:24:29,960
No one feels sorry.

523
00:24:29,960 --> 00:24:31,960
No one is sorry.

524
00:24:31,960 --> 00:24:35,960
It's true that in other games, everyone said they were sorry.

525
00:24:35,960 --> 00:24:37,960
It's true.

526
00:24:37,960 --> 00:24:39,960
They were four good guys.

527
00:24:39,960 --> 00:24:41,960
That was so scary.

528
00:24:41,960 --> 00:24:43,960
You should all come backstage later.

529
00:24:43,960 --> 00:24:50,960
Maybe that's it, just say thank you for making it so good, and give me a bit of pocket money.

530
00:24:50,960 --> 00:25:02,288
Thank you for your hard work.

531
00:25:02,288 --> 00:25:05,788
Sword bullet.

532
00:25:05,788 --> 00:25:08,608
Something happened, didn't it?

533
00:25:10,928 --> 00:25:13,568
Here we go.

534
00:25:13,568 --> 00:25:20,568
One more time, one more time.

535
00:25:20,568 --> 00:25:25,568
