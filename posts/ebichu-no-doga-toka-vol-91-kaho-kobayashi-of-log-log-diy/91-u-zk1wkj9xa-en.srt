Collaboration Project! Kaho Kobayashi of Log Log DIY

2
00:00:02,380 --> 00:00:06,140
Collaboration Project! This time, we would like to share with you a video clip of the YouTube channel "Log Log DIY" which started on May 8, 2012.

3
00:00:06,300 --> 00:00:07,130
How are you all doing?

4
00:00:07,240 --> 00:00:08,150
How are you all?

5
00:00:08,430 --> 00:00:08,790
Hello everyone!

6
00:00:11,580 --> 00:00:14,900
It's such a beautiful day today.

7
00:00:15,020 --> 00:00:17,020
Insects, too.

8
00:00:17,130 --> 00:00:21,760
Insects are flying around... on such a nice day.

9
00:00:21,880 --> 00:00:23,690
What a surprise!

10
00:00:23,810 --> 00:00:24,820
This time

11
00:00:24,910 --> 00:00:27,370
I tried my hand at DIY!

12
00:00:27,510 --> 00:00:30,300
It's called "Log Log DIY."

13
00:00:30,430 --> 00:00:32,619
It's my first time to try it.

14
00:00:32,759 --> 00:00:34,400
I really want to do it right.

15
00:00:34,550 --> 00:00:36,959
I'm going to build it by myself.

16
00:00:37,089 --> 00:00:38,120
I do everything myself.

17
00:00:38,209 --> 00:00:39,820
I'm going to do a real DIY by myself.

18
00:00:39,940 --> 00:00:41,440
I'm going to do DIY.

19
00:00:41,559 --> 00:00:43,750
I'm just...

20
00:00:43,879 --> 00:00:45,080
I thought I'd start with the outfit.

21
00:00:45,339 --> 00:00:46,150
I've equipped myself!

22
00:00:46,260 --> 00:00:47,360
Look at this!

23
00:00:47,559 --> 00:00:48,370
What do you think?

24
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:52,599
I've equipped myself with this outfit!

25
00:00:52,709 --> 00:00:54,320
The shoes are really hard.

26
00:00:54,449 --> 00:00:57,239
really hard, for example.

27
00:00:57,390 --> 00:01:03,059
It would be save when things fall on it.

28
00:01:03,199 --> 00:01:04,899
I've never worn shoes like this before.

29
00:01:05,030 --> 00:01:05,940
I got it!

30
00:01:06,060 --> 00:01:07,420
The tips of the blades!

31
00:01:07,520 --> 00:01:08,050
Amazing!

32
00:01:08,420 --> 00:01:11,070
Don't kick people's shins with these!

33
00:01:13,179 --> 00:01:15,310
Anyway, I'm going to enjoy doing it!

34
00:01:15,450 --> 00:01:18,970
This is my first DIY project

35
00:01:19,119 --> 00:01:21,619
I don't know if I can make it well

36
00:01:21,759 --> 00:01:23,500
I'm not sure if I can do it well, but I'm willing to give it a try!

37
00:01:23,660 --> 00:01:25,060
I'll do my best!

38
00:01:27,500 --> 00:01:28,980
Let's start filming!

39
00:01:55,230 --> 00:01:56,890
This time

40
00:01:57,009 --> 00:01:59,250
I'll be the first DIYer on this channel.

41
00:01:59,369 --> 00:02:01,369
As a DIY first timer

42
00:02:01,480 --> 00:02:02,250
I'm going to try my best

43
00:02:02,369 --> 00:02:05,460
I'm going to give it a try!

44
00:02:39,780 --> 00:02:43,690
My original helmet is completed!

45
00:02:45,580 --> 00:02:48,910
The point is, of course, this!

46
00:02:49,070 --> 00:02:51,220
It is a standing "K"!

47
00:02:51,380 --> 00:02:53,690
This is "K" of "KOBAYASHI Kaho".

48
00:02:53,850 --> 00:02:55,620
I wanted to make the "K" stand up.

49
00:02:55,770 --> 00:02:57,010
If you turn around...

50
00:02:57,160 --> 00:02:58,530
You can see the "P" in "P".

51
00:02:58,700 --> 00:03:00,170
So, no matter where you are

52
00:03:00,310 --> 00:03:03,390
I drew the "K" so that it is easy to see and find.

53
00:03:04,130 --> 00:03:06,430
I drew this picture.

54
00:03:06,570 --> 00:03:08,030
When I put it on

55
00:03:08,180 --> 00:03:09,990
It looks like this!

56
00:03:11,490 --> 00:03:14,720
I imagined it like a helicopter propeller

57
00:03:14,870 --> 00:03:17,280
like a propeller of a helicopter.

58
00:03:17,420 --> 00:03:19,640
I didn't imagine it at all! (lol)

59
00:03:19,780 --> 00:03:20,230
You lied!

60
00:03:20,380 --> 00:03:22,390
I lied...

61
00:03:22,540 --> 00:03:26,100
Like this.

62
00:03:29,030 --> 00:03:30,130
It's called a jaan.

63
00:03:30,280 --> 00:03:33,530
You don't see people wearing this helmet very often.

64
00:03:33,670 --> 00:03:35,390
You've probably never seen it!

65
00:03:35,520 --> 00:03:36,370
Original Helmet

66
00:03:36,520 --> 00:03:38,970
Please try to make your own helmet!

67
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:42,350
Check out the video below to see it in action!

68
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:45,420
Check out the video!

69
00:03:45,550 --> 00:03:46,530
See you later!

70
00:03:52,730 --> 00:03:54,370
Next up...?

71
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:28,630
Please watch while guessing what Mr. Kobayashi is making!

72
00:05:06,070 --> 00:05:08,120
The moment the blade enters

73
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:10,740
I get really nervous when the blade goes in.

74
00:05:10,870 --> 00:05:13,320
It's so much fun...!

75
00:05:13,450 --> 00:05:15,020
Does it feel good to cut?

76
00:05:15,150 --> 00:05:16,260
It feels great!

77
00:05:16,410 --> 00:05:19,080
It's really spicier than I thought it would be.

78
00:05:19,220 --> 00:05:21,680
Oh, it's just a...... It's like...

79
00:05:21,810 --> 00:05:24,340
It's like when you go through a ticket gate.

80
00:05:24,470 --> 00:05:26,910
That's how spastic it is.

81
00:05:27,110 --> 00:05:28,650
It's a lot of fun!

82
00:05:28,870 --> 00:05:31,050
Even girls can do it!

83
00:05:49,730 --> 00:05:51,620
After this, I'll be back for more.

84
00:05:51,740 --> 00:05:55,510
I don't know what I'm going to do or not...

85
00:05:55,650 --> 00:05:57,250
You'll see what I do and don't do in the video.

86
00:05:57,380 --> 00:06:00,510
You'll have to wait until you see the video to find out what we do and don't do!

87
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:03,050
A short break!

88
00:06:06,660 --> 00:06:08,770
I made karaage bento!

89
00:06:08,910 --> 00:06:10,180
Let's eat!

90
00:06:13,530 --> 00:06:14,730
White rice first!

91
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:15,860
Here we go!

92
00:06:15,990 --> 00:06:17,380
Looks delicious!

93
00:06:25,700 --> 00:06:27,370
From the left corner of the white rice

94
00:06:27,530 --> 00:06:29,530
I'm going to attack!

95
00:06:31,780 --> 00:06:33,740
There were 5 pieces of fried bean curd!

96
00:06:44,220 --> 00:06:45,770
Delicious!

97
00:06:45,920 --> 00:06:47,570
What's been the most fun so far? Of course!

98
00:06:47,720 --> 00:06:51,960
Sawing was fun, but

99
00:06:52,100 --> 00:06:56,080
Personally, I enjoyed the sawing

100
00:06:56,220 --> 00:06:59,330
Cutting it down to the halfway point

101
00:06:59,470 --> 00:07:01,320
To clean up the bumpy parts

102
00:07:01,450 --> 00:07:03,240
I used to use a tongsaw to clean up the bumpy parts.

103
00:07:03,370 --> 00:07:07,310
I really liked it, and it was fun to do.

104
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:10,370
It was fun work.

105
00:07:10,510 --> 00:07:12,420
I don't know.

106
00:07:12,590 --> 00:07:14,050
When I did it with a hammer, it was like...

107
00:07:14,200 --> 00:07:16,390
It was really like shaké flakes.

108
00:07:16,540 --> 00:07:19,700
It felt really good to see the wood flattening out.

109
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:21,120
It felt really good!

110
00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:23,110
Do you like DIY now? DIY a little

111
00:07:23,250 --> 00:07:24,430
I'm a little interested in DIY!

112
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:27,330
I don't know if I can do it or not.

113
00:07:27,450 --> 00:07:28,220
I don't know if I can do it or not.

114
00:07:28,330 --> 00:07:30,380
I don't know if I can do it or not.

115
00:07:30,700 --> 00:07:32,190
I'm enjoying it, but if I was doing it alone

116
00:07:32,330 --> 00:07:35,280
But if I had to do it alone, I'd be a bit sketchy.

117
00:07:35,420 --> 00:07:37,730
"Someday!" And then I'd do it.

118
00:07:37,880 --> 00:07:39,450
I'm not sure I'll be able to put it together

119
00:07:39,580 --> 00:07:41,280
I don't think I could do it.

120
00:07:41,430 --> 00:07:44,450
But I was interested in it.

121
00:07:44,600 --> 00:07:46,610
I thought I'd like to try it!

122
00:07:46,750 --> 00:07:47,740
Here we are

123
00:07:47,880 --> 00:07:49,780
Under a nice sunny sky

124
00:07:49,910 --> 00:07:51,000
I'm eating well.

125
00:07:51,130 --> 00:07:53,130
Would you like to share a meal with us?

126
00:07:53,260 --> 00:07:55,860
Would you like to share a meal with us?

127
00:07:56,010 --> 00:07:57,000
Let's eat!

128
00:07:58,450 --> 00:08:00,030
I love rice!

129
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:01,560
Delicious~!!!!

130
00:08:05,780 --> 00:08:07,430
End of the break! Last DIY!

131
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:27,790
Please watch what Mr. Kobayashi is making!

132
00:08:48,120 --> 00:08:49,729
It's just a little bit...

133
00:08:49,849 --> 00:08:51,280
I'm getting used to it.

134
00:08:51,380 --> 00:08:52,180
A little bit like this

135
00:08:52,280 --> 00:08:55,089
I can cut smoothly and quickly now.

136
00:08:55,209 --> 00:08:57,130
He told me a while ago that he got used to it.

137
00:08:58,050 --> 00:08:58,870
in the blink of an eye.

138
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:02,479
He said he was going to start assembling now.

139
00:09:02,609 --> 00:09:04,050
I'm already feeling

140
00:09:04,189 --> 00:09:06,939
I feel like I've already done DIY!

141
00:09:07,089 --> 00:09:13,060
Is there anything you would like to make as a DIY project? I would like to make a shelf.

142
00:09:13,199 --> 00:09:15,290
I'd like to make a shelf where I can put books and stuff.

143
00:09:15,439 --> 00:09:17,339
I don't read books that much (laughs).

144
00:09:18,490 --> 00:09:19,939
Some kind of tiny bookshelf.

145
00:09:20,089 --> 00:09:23,310
I'd like to make a shelf where I can put small things.

146
00:09:23,449 --> 00:09:24,979
I'd like to make a shelf for small things!

147
00:09:56,780 --> 00:09:59,530
How did you feel about the DIY project?

148
00:09:59,660 --> 00:10:03,520
I really wanted to make a small bookshelf.

149
00:10:03,650 --> 00:10:04,300
I said before I made the video.

150
00:10:04,430 --> 00:10:08,599
I was really a DIY beginner.

151
00:10:08,699 --> 00:10:10,579
I wondered what kind of things I could make today.

152
00:10:10,709 --> 00:10:12,270
I wondered what kind of things I could make today.

153
00:10:12,390 --> 00:10:15,920
I thought I could do more than I imagined.

154
00:10:16,060 --> 00:10:17,880
I had a lot of fun.

155
00:10:18,010 --> 00:10:21,280
I'm a little bit like this.

156
00:10:21,410 --> 00:10:24,979
Today, I had a mentor, Mr. Kobayashi

157
00:10:25,109 --> 00:10:27,410
Mr. Kobayashi, my senior, was there to teach me.

158
00:10:27,560 --> 00:10:29,180
I was able to make it without any worries.

159
00:10:29,300 --> 00:10:31,380
I thought, "Next time, I'll try to make it by myself.

160
00:10:31,479 --> 00:10:35,250
I thought I'd like to try making something by myself next time!

161
00:10:35,380 --> 00:10:37,319
Tools and stuff.

162
00:10:37,459 --> 00:10:41,140
Electric... screwdriver!

163
00:10:41,270 --> 00:10:43,359
Impact driver!

164
00:10:43,500 --> 00:10:46,540
I really want to get one!

165
00:10:46,670 --> 00:10:48,949
I want to stop by Home Depot!

166
00:10:49,609 --> 00:10:52,579
You improved in a day!

167
00:10:52,689 --> 00:10:54,430
You really did.

168
00:10:54,560 --> 00:10:56,040
When I was doing it

169
00:10:56,180 --> 00:10:58,709
You showed me little by little how to do it.

170
00:10:58,829 --> 00:11:01,050
I did exactly as he said.

171
00:11:01,189 --> 00:11:03,430
I got better. !!!!

172
00:11:03,550 --> 00:11:05,900
When I hit that screw

173
00:11:06,050 --> 00:11:07,650
I was able to do it very smoothly

174
00:11:07,790 --> 00:11:09,550
I was so happy!

175
00:11:09,680 --> 00:11:11,359
I was so happy!

176
00:11:11,930 --> 00:11:13,660
I'll probably talk about it a little bit

177
00:11:13,790 --> 00:11:15,359
I think I've already told you how it turned out

178
00:11:15,479 --> 00:11:17,400
I'm sure I'll be telling you all about it.

179
00:11:17,530 --> 00:11:20,000
Please check out the Log Log DIY video to see how it's going!

180
00:11:20,130 --> 00:11:22,579
Please check out the Log Log DIY video!
