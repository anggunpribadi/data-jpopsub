00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,000
How are you all doing?

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:11,000
Hello, I'm Kobayashi Kaho, 51 years old.

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:19,000
Today is a nice day, and the bugs are
flying around.

5
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:21,000
It's a cheap day.

6
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:30,000
I'm going to try DIY this time.

7
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:36,000
It's my first time, but I'm going to
make it myself.

8
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:41,000
I'm going to do it myself.

9
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:46,000
I'm going to start from the past, so
I've got it.

10
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:52,000
Look at this. I've got this.

11
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:57,000
The shoes are really hard.

12
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:03,000
It's safe even if the shoes fall.

13
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:08,000
It's my first time wearing shoes like
this.

14
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:13,000
I'm going to make a snow kitchen.

15
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:19,000
I'm going to enjoy it.

16
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:27,000
I don't know if I can make it well, but
I'm going to try it.

17
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,000
How to make DIY

18
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,000
I'm Kobayashi Kaho.

19
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:36,000
This is my first DIY.

20
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:39,000
Thank you.

21
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:44,000
I'm going to make a logo DIY.

22

24
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:54,000
Hello, I'm Kobayashi Kaho, 51 years old.

25
00:01:54,000 --> 00:02:05,000
I'm going to try DIY this time.

26
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:13,000
I'm going to paint it and make a helmet.

27
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:16,000
I'm going to try it.

28
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:19,000
I'm wondering if it's difficult to
paint.

29
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:22,000
It's a beautiful blue.

30
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:31,000
What color should I make?

31
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:31,170
Please subscribe to the channel.

32
00:02:31,170 --> 00:02:33,170
It's hard.

33
00:02:35,490 --> 00:02:37,490
I did it!

34
00:02:38,570 --> 00:02:43,590
So the original helmet is done!

35
00:02:43,590 --> 00:02:45,390
Ta-da!

36
00:02:45,390 --> 00:02:48,970
The point is this!

37
00:02:48,970 --> 00:02:50,970
It's a pole.

38
00:02:50,970 --> 00:02:55,450
This is a pole for the Kobaishi Kaho, so
I wanted to make a pole.

39
00:02:55,450 --> 00:03:02,650
And there's a pole behind it, so you can
see it anywhere.

40
00:03:02,650 --> 00:03:09,290
I bought it, but it looks like this.

41
00:03:09,290 --> 00:03:17,090
It looks like a helicopter propeller.

42
00:03:17,090 --> 00:03:19,090
I didn't imagine it at all.

43
00:03:19,090 --> 00:03:21,090
I lied.

44
00:03:21,090 --> 00:03:26,090
It's like this.

45
00:03:26,090 --> 00:03:30,090
Ta-da!

46
00:03:30,090 --> 00:03:33,090
It's hard to wear a helmet like this.

47
00:03:33,090 --> 00:03:35,090
I'm sure you've never seen it before.

48
00:03:35,090 --> 00:03:39,090
Please try making your own original
helmet.

49
00:03:39,090 --> 00:03:45,090
Please check out the video where I
actually made it!

50
00:03:45,090 --> 00:03:52,090
See you!

51
00:03:52,090 --> 00:03:54,090
The end.

52
00:03:54,090 --> 00:03:56,090

53
00:03:56,090 --> 00:03:58,090
Hello, everyone.

54
00:03:58,090 --> 00:04:01,090
I'm Kobaishi Kaho, number 51 in the
Shizuoka City University.

55
00:04:01,090 --> 00:04:07,090
I want to try DIY this time, too.

56
00:04:07,090 --> 00:04:13,090
I want to do my best to make the
beginners feel sad.

57
00:04:13,090 --> 00:04:17,090
Please subscribe to my channel and give
it a high rating.

58
00:04:17,090 --> 00:04:22,090
So, what are we going to do this time?

59
00:04:22,090 --> 00:04:26,090
I'm a little worried, but it looks fun.

60
00:04:26,090 --> 00:04:28,090
I'm going to try it.

61
00:04:28,090 --> 00:04:33,090
By the way, what is this?

62
00:04:33,090 --> 00:04:39,090
This is a electric round saw.

63
00:04:39,090 --> 00:04:43,090
It's a round saw.

64
00:04:43,090 --> 00:04:47,090
I'll hold it firmly.

65
00:04:47,090 --> 00:04:55,090
I'm going to cut it with a saw.

66
00:04:55,090 --> 00:04:57,090
You're good at it.

67
00:04:57,090 --> 00:04:59,090
Wow!

68
00:04:59,090 --> 00:05:01,506
Thank you for your viewing.

69
00:05:01,506 --> 00:05:03,506
It's not fun.

70
00:05:04,226 --> 00:05:10,066
I'm so excited when I see the teeth.

71
00:05:10,066 --> 00:05:13,066
It's so much fun.

72
00:05:13,066 --> 00:05:15,066
Do you feel good?

73
00:05:15,066 --> 00:05:17,066
Yes, I feel good.

74
00:05:17,066 --> 00:05:19,066
It's a spot.

75
00:05:19,066 --> 00:05:21,066
It's a spot.

76
00:05:21,066 --> 00:05:24,066
I feel like I'm going to do it when I
take a picture.

77
00:05:24,066 --> 00:05:26,066
It's a spot.

78
00:05:26,066 --> 00:05:28,066
It's so much fun.

79
00:05:28,066 --> 00:05:30,066
Even for girls.

80
00:05:30,066 --> 00:05:32,066
I'm going to do it.

81
00:05:32,066 --> 00:05:34,066
I see.

82
00:05:34,066 --> 00:05:38,066
I think I know what it is.

83
00:05:38,066 --> 00:05:40,066
It's okay.

84
00:05:40,066 --> 00:05:42,066
Wow.

85
00:05:42,066 --> 00:05:44,066
It's amazing.

86
00:05:44,066 --> 00:05:48,066
It's so much fun.

87
00:05:48,066 --> 00:05:54,066
I'm going to paint it after this.

88
00:05:54,066 --> 00:05:56,066
I don't know if I'm going to do it.

89
00:05:56,066 --> 00:06:00,066
Please look forward to it.

90
00:06:00,066 --> 00:06:02,066
I'm going to eat.

91
00:06:02,066 --> 00:06:04,066
I'm going to eat.

92
00:06:04,066 --> 00:06:06,066
I'm going to eat.

93
00:06:06,066 --> 00:06:08,066
I made fried rice with fried chicken.

94
00:06:08,066 --> 00:06:10,066
I'm going to eat.

95
00:06:10,066 --> 00:06:12,066
I'm going to eat.

96
00:06:12,066 --> 00:06:14,066
I'm going to eat white rice.

97
00:06:14,066 --> 00:06:16,066
It looks delicious.

98
00:06:16,066 --> 00:06:18,066
It looks delicious.

99
00:06:26,066 --> 00:06:28,066
I'm going to eat from the left corner of
the white rice.

100
00:06:32,066 --> 00:06:34,066
Fried chicken is also in here.

101
00:06:34,066 --> 00:06:36,066
I'm going to eat.

102
00:06:36,066 --> 00:06:38,066
It's delicious.

103
00:06:44,066 --> 00:06:46,066
It's delicious.

104
00:06:46,066 --> 00:06:52,066
Of course, I enjoyed cutting the green
onions.

105
00:06:52,066 --> 00:06:58,066
I cut it in half when I was assembling
it.

106
00:06:58,066 --> 00:07:02,066
I used tongkachi to clean up the bumpy
part.

107
00:07:02,066 --> 00:07:06,066
I like it.

108
00:07:06,066 --> 00:07:10,066
It was a fun job.

109
00:07:10,066 --> 00:07:12,066
I was doing it.

110
00:07:12,066 --> 00:07:14,066
I was doing it.

111
00:07:14,066 --> 00:07:16,066
It was like a salmon flake.

112
00:07:16,066 --> 00:07:20,066
The trees were beautiful and flat.

113
00:07:20,066 --> 00:07:24,066
I was interested in love.

114
00:07:24,066 --> 00:07:26,066
I don't know if I can do it.

115
00:07:26,066 --> 00:07:32,066
I'm happy because I'm with DAIKU today.

116
00:07:32,066 --> 00:07:35,202
If I were alone, I would have a big
problem.

117
00:07:35,202 --> 00:07:37,202
I'm not sure if I can do it.

118
00:07:37,202 --> 00:07:41,202
I think I can't do it when I'm done with
it.

119
00:07:41,202 --> 00:07:44,202
But I'm interested in it.

120
00:07:44,202 --> 00:07:46,202
So I want to try it.

121
00:07:46,202 --> 00:07:51,202
I'm eating under the nice weather.

122
00:07:51,202 --> 00:07:55,202
Would you like to eat with me?

123
00:07:55,202 --> 00:07:57,202
Let's eat!

124
00:07:58,202 --> 00:08:00,202
The rice is the best!

125
00:08:00,202 --> 00:08:05,202
I'm hungry!

126
00:08:05,202 --> 00:08:09,202
Let's cut the legs.

127
00:08:09,202 --> 00:08:19,202
I'm scared because I have a lot of thick
wood.

128
00:08:19,202 --> 00:08:23,202
I think it's okay to cut the same way.

129
00:08:23,202 --> 00:08:31,202
I'll cut the legs first.

130
00:08:36,202 --> 00:08:38,202
Are you okay?

131
00:08:38,202 --> 00:08:40,202
I'm okay.

132
00:08:42,202 --> 00:08:45,202
I cut it like this.

133
00:08:45,202 --> 00:08:53,202
I'm getting used to it.

134
00:08:53,202 --> 00:08:57,202
I cut it smoothly.

135
00:08:57,202 --> 00:09:02,202
I'm getting used to it.

136
00:09:02,202 --> 00:09:07,202
I feel like I'm doing DIY.

137
00:09:07,202 --> 00:09:11,202
I want to make a shelf.

138
00:09:11,202 --> 00:09:15,202
I want to make a bookshelf.

139
00:09:15,202 --> 00:09:17,202
I don't say much.

140
00:09:17,202 --> 00:09:46,202
I want to make a bookshelf that can hold
small things.

141
00:09:46,202 --> 00:09:52,202
I'm done!

142
00:09:52,202 --> 00:09:54,202
Thank you for watching!

143
00:09:54,202 --> 00:09:56,202
Thank you for watching!

144
00:09:56,202 --> 00:09:59,202
Please subscribe to my channel!

145
00:09:59,202 --> 00:10:04,202
I said this before I made the video.

146
00:10:04,202 --> 00:10:08,226
I was a DIY beginner.

147
00:10:08,226 --> 00:10:15,566
I was able to make something that I
didn't expect.

148
00:10:15,566 --> 00:10:17,826
It was so much fun.

149
00:10:17,826 --> 00:10:29,106
Today, I was able to make something
because my teacher told me.

150
00:10:29,106 --> 00:10:35,026
Next time, I'll make something by
myself.

151
00:10:35,026 --> 00:10:41,026
I also want tools like electric
screwdriver.

152
00:10:41,026 --> 00:10:46,306
I want impact driver.

153
00:10:46,306 --> 00:10:49,026
I want to open a home center.

154
00:10:49,026 --> 00:10:52,506
What are the tips for making a home
center?

155
00:10:52,506 --> 00:10:58,666
My teacher taught me some tips when I
was doing it.

156
00:10:58,666 --> 00:11:03,346
I improved when I did it as it was.

157
00:11:03,346 --> 00:11:09,346
I was able to make it smoothly when I
was hitting the screw.

158
00:11:09,346 --> 00:11:11,266
I was very happy.

159
00:11:11,266 --> 00:11:17,346
I'm going to tell you what happened.

160
00:11:17,346 --> 00:11:21,746
Please watch the video.

161
00:11:21,746 --> 00:11:24,506
Bye bye.

162
00:11:24,506 --> 00:11:48,506
It was fun.
