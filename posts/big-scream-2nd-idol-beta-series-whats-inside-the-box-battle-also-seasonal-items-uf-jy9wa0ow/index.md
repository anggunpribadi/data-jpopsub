This video is
Part 2 without Sakuma P!

"Idol Beta Series" A battle to find out what's inside the box! ”

One of the projects that idols often do, "Guess what's inside the box". Divide into high school team and older sister team and compete! Challenge one person at a time, The team with the most correct answers wins.

Ho Tae Sung is also divided into teams! (Takeru...high school team/Shogo...sister team)

People around you know the correct answer and try it while encouraging you, Try it without anyone knowing what it is! The contents of the box start from solid items. I even tried something a little different.

This is also “idol variety training”!
Please enjoy until the end!
