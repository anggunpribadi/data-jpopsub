1
00:00:00,218 --> 00:00:07,218
Nogizaka, let's go!

2
00:00:07,218 --> 00:00:08,218
Don!

3
00:00:08,218 --> 00:00:11,218
We are Nogizaka Gojichu, and I am your
host, Banana Man.

4
00:00:11,218 --> 00:00:12,218
Nice to meet you!

5
00:00:12,218 --> 00:00:14,218
Welcome, Nogizaka-chan!

6
00:00:14,218 --> 00:00:16,218
Yay!

7
00:00:16,218 --> 00:00:18,218
Yay!

8
00:00:18,218 --> 00:00:26,218
Yay!

9
00:00:26,218 --> 00:00:27,568
Thank you.

10
00:00:28,568 --> 00:00:31,568
Here's what's not here.

11
00:00:31,568 --> 00:00:33,568
Let's get started.

12
00:00:33,568 --> 00:00:35,568
The 31st single, Hitkiga!

13
00:00:37,568 --> 00:00:39,568
So, this is the 31st single.

14
00:00:39,568 --> 00:00:42,568
It was released on December 7th.

15
00:00:42,568 --> 00:00:44,568
It's a cocoa stew.

16
00:00:46,568 --> 00:00:48,568
That sounds bad.

17
00:00:48,568 --> 00:00:50,568
It's a cocoa stew.

18
00:00:50,568 --> 00:00:54,568
Everyone is predicting how much you'll
get it wrong.

19
00:00:54,568 --> 00:00:57,568
I'm just saying it randomly.

20
00:00:57,568 --> 00:00:59,568
I'm not predicting.

21
00:00:59,568 --> 00:01:01,568
I'm sure no one will get it right.

22
00:01:01,568 --> 00:01:03,568
It's not here.

23
00:01:03,568 --> 00:01:06,568
Asuka announced her graduation.

24
00:01:06,568 --> 00:01:08,568
She'll be active until December 1st.

25
00:01:08,568 --> 00:01:10,568
But she'll be on this show forever.

26
00:01:10,568 --> 00:01:12,568
I heard that.

27
00:01:12,568 --> 00:01:14,568
I didn't hear that.

28
00:01:14,568 --> 00:01:16,568
So, it's coming soon?

29
00:01:16,568 --> 00:01:18,568
It's the end of the year.

30
00:01:18,568 --> 00:01:20,568
That's sad.

31
00:01:20,568 --> 00:01:22,568
So, you're going alone this time?

32
00:01:22,568 --> 00:01:24,568
Yes, I am.

33
00:01:24,568 --> 00:01:25,568
Really?

34
00:01:25,568 --> 00:01:28,568
You're not going to climb a hill by
yourself, are you?

35
00:01:28,568 --> 00:01:31,296
No way.

36
00:01:32,296 --> 00:01:36,296
The 31st single, Hit Kigan!

37
00:01:37,296 --> 00:01:38,296
Where is this?

38
00:01:42,296 --> 00:01:52,296
This hit Kigan is not only about the
single hit, but also about the last
student, Asuka Saito, who has seen the
history of Nogizaka Kesseiji.

39
00:01:53,296 --> 00:01:59,296
The rest of the members will make a
journey to wish for further activities.

40
00:01:59,296 --> 00:02:07,296
So, on the way to the trip, the members
will think of a passionate message for
each of the 40 people.

41
00:02:08,296 --> 00:02:13,296
At the end, with that thought, we will
make a hit wish at the shrine in the
destination.

42
00:02:14,296 --> 00:02:18,296
And the location is Asuka, Nara
Prefecture.

43
00:02:19,296 --> 00:02:24,296
Please make a wish to connect to the
future of Nogizaka in Asuka Yukari's
land.

44
00:02:24,296 --> 00:02:25,296
Oh!

45
00:02:26,296 --> 00:02:27,296
Asuka station.

46
00:02:28,296 --> 00:02:29,296
Asuka station.

47
00:02:30,296 --> 00:02:31,296
Hello, Bal, I was brought here.

48
00:02:32,296 --> 00:02:35,296
So, this time we came to Nara
Prefecture.

49
00:02:36,296 --> 00:02:41,296
A relaxing journey to wish for the
members in Asuka, a land where Yukari is
not yet.

50
00:02:42,296 --> 00:02:49,296
It's a location where nothing happens,
but will you find something that is not
here that leads to the future of
Nogizaka?

51
00:02:49,296 --> 00:02:54,296
I came here for the first time. I came
to Nara.

52
00:02:55,296 --> 00:02:56,296
How is it?

53
00:02:57,296 --> 00:03:01,296
No, but I brought Asuka to Asuka.

54
00:03:02,296 --> 00:03:06,296
Everyone thinks of it at first, so no
one did it.

55
00:03:07,296 --> 00:03:13,296
I came here and did what no one had
done, and I can do it at the end.

56
00:03:14,296 --> 00:03:16,296
But it's really full of Asuka.

57
00:03:16,296 --> 00:03:18,296
It's really Asuka.

58
00:03:19,296 --> 00:03:20,296
It's written there, too.

59
00:03:21,296 --> 00:03:23,296
It's written from Asuka in Japan to
Asuka in the world.

60
00:03:24,296 --> 00:03:25,296
What is Asuka?

61
00:03:26,296 --> 00:03:28,296
I really want to take a picture of that.

62
00:03:29,296 --> 00:03:30,296
It's like I got a message.

63
00:03:31,296 --> 00:03:32,296
Asuka is really good.

64
00:03:32,296 --> 00:03:33,952
It's true.

65
00:03:34,952 --> 00:03:35,952
It's me.

66
00:03:35,952 --> 00:03:36,952
What do you mean?

67
00:03:37,952 --> 00:03:38,952
Asuka is really good.

68
00:03:38,952 --> 00:03:39,952
What?

69
00:03:39,952 --> 00:03:40,952
I feel good.

70
00:03:40,952 --> 00:03:46,952
Asuka is really good.

71
00:03:50,152 --> 00:03:53,152
There is a Japanese future and origin.

72
00:03:54,152 --> 00:03:55,152
It's amazing.

73
00:03:56,152 --> 00:03:58,152
It's like a cheap prank.

74
00:03:58,152 --> 00:04:00,152
It's the future and origin.

75
00:04:00,152 --> 00:04:02,152
I was told that for a while.

76
00:04:04,152 --> 00:04:06,152
I was young and energetic.

77
00:04:11,152 --> 00:04:13,152
Asuka's dream sales place.

78
00:04:13,152 --> 00:04:15,152
I'm going to buy a lot of Asuka's.

79
00:04:17,152 --> 00:04:19,152
I'm excited.

80
00:04:19,152 --> 00:04:21,152
I've heard of Asuka Ruby.

81
00:04:22,152 --> 00:04:23,152
Strawberry?

82
00:04:24,152 --> 00:04:29,152
Asuka found the Asuka Ruby's cream.

83
00:04:29,152 --> 00:04:31,152
This is the last Asuka mission.

84
00:04:33,152 --> 00:04:36,152
Let's get permission from the shop.

85
00:04:36,152 --> 00:04:39,152
Let's enjoy the soft.

86
00:04:40,152 --> 00:04:42,152
Hello.

87
00:04:42,152 --> 00:04:44,152
You are cute.

88
00:04:44,152 --> 00:04:46,152
Thank you.

89
00:04:46,152 --> 00:04:50,152
I'm an idol in Tokyo.

90
00:04:51,152 --> 00:04:52,152
Really?

91
00:04:53,152 --> 00:04:54,152
I'm glad.

92
00:04:54,152 --> 00:04:56,152
Why do you know?

93
00:04:56,152 --> 00:04:57,152
I know.

94
00:04:57,152 --> 00:04:58,152
Really?

95
00:04:58,152 --> 00:04:59,152
I'm glad.

96
00:04:59,152 --> 00:05:03,152
I'm in Asuka.

97
00:05:03,152 --> 00:05:07,152
I was told that there is Asuka Ruby's
soft.

98
00:05:07,152 --> 00:05:10,152
Can I eat it?

99
00:05:10,152 --> 00:05:12,152
Thank you.

100
00:05:12,152 --> 00:05:14,152
I'm glad.

101
00:05:16,152 --> 00:05:21,152
She got the cream.

102
00:05:22,152 --> 00:05:24,152
It smells good.

103
00:05:24,152 --> 00:05:27,152
She will eat it.

104
00:05:30,152 --> 00:05:33,152
I want to be seen eating the cream.

105
00:05:34,152 --> 00:05:35,152
I hate it.

106
00:05:35,152 --> 00:05:37,152
I'm not.

107
00:05:37,152 --> 00:05:39,152
You are too conscious.

108
00:05:39,152 --> 00:05:40,152
I hate it.

109
00:05:40,152 --> 00:05:41,152
It's good.

110
00:05:41,152 --> 00:05:42,152
It's good.

111
00:05:42,152 --> 00:05:44,152
It's refreshing.

112
00:05:44,152 --> 00:05:46,152
It's sour.

113
00:05:47,152 --> 00:05:48,152
It's a little sour.

114
00:05:49,152 --> 00:05:51,152
She is eating it secretly.

115
00:05:51,152 --> 00:05:54,152
She is listening to the shop's thoughts.

116
00:05:54,152 --> 00:06:00,768
I've been a fan of Sanki since I was a
child.

117
00:06:01,768 --> 00:06:06,768
I've been a fan of Sanki since I was a
child.

118
00:06:06,768 --> 00:06:12,768
I've been a fan of Sanki since I was a
child.

119
00:06:12,768 --> 00:06:16,768
I've been a fan of Sanki since I was a
child.

120
00:06:16,768 --> 00:06:20,768
I've been a fan of Sanki since I was a
child.

121
00:06:20,768 --> 00:06:26,768
At that time, Sanki students were having
a meeting to talk about their memories
with Asuka.

122
00:06:26,768 --> 00:06:30,768
I heard that Sanki is going to the
concert alone.

123
00:06:30,768 --> 00:06:34,768
I wanted to go with her.

124
00:06:34,768 --> 00:06:36,768
I didn't want her to come.

125
00:06:36,768 --> 00:06:38,768
I like her alone.

126
00:06:38,768 --> 00:06:40,768
Do you like her alone?

127
00:06:40,768 --> 00:06:42,768
How do you feel?

128
00:06:42,768 --> 00:06:46,768
I was strangled in the past during the
concert.

129
00:06:46,768 --> 00:06:49,768
I was strangled in the past during the
concert.

130
00:06:49,768 --> 00:06:53,768
The first time I was strangled was at
the Oide Shampoo concert.

131
00:06:53,768 --> 00:07:01,768
I was strangled in the place where I was
cleaning.

132
00:07:01,768 --> 00:07:03,768
I was very happy.

133
00:07:03,768 --> 00:07:05,768
I was very happy.

134
00:07:05,768 --> 00:07:07,768
I was very happy.

135
00:07:07,768 --> 00:07:11,768
Asuka is a person who is very shy.

136
00:07:11,768 --> 00:07:13,768
Asuka is a person who is very shy.

137
00:07:13,768 --> 00:07:15,768
Yoda is very persistent.

138
00:07:15,768 --> 00:07:17,768
Yoda is very persistent.

139
00:07:17,768 --> 00:07:21,768
I can't see him anymore after
graduation.

140
00:07:21,768 --> 00:07:27,768
I always say that I want to take a
picture and go to dinner with him.

141
00:07:27,768 --> 00:07:29,768
I always refuse.

142
00:07:29,768 --> 00:07:32,768
I understand it once.

143
00:07:32,768 --> 00:07:34,768
I'm glad he said that.

144
00:07:34,768 --> 00:07:35,768
I said, OK.

145
00:07:35,768 --> 00:07:39,768
I could not feel my joy at that time.

146
00:07:39,768 --> 00:07:40,768
I said, OK.

147
00:07:40,768 --> 00:07:41,768
I said, OK.

148
00:07:41,768 --> 00:07:42,768
I said, OK.

149
00:07:42,768 --> 00:07:43,768
I said, OK.

150
00:07:43,768 --> 00:07:45,948
oh the TV has changed

151
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:51,560
Asuka Saito summarizes such a night talk
in one word.

152
00:07:51,560 --> 00:07:56,560
The night talk is simply a bomb rice
ball.

153
00:07:56,560 --> 00:08:00,560
What is this?

154
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:02,560
The face is cute.

155
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:07,560
It's funny and the singing voice is
cute.

156
00:08:07,560 --> 00:08:14,560
The dance is normal, but I think it's a
delicious type no matter where you bite
it.

157
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:21,560
It's a bomb rice ball, but I've been
growing up lately, so I feel a little
mature.

158
00:08:21,560 --> 00:08:29,560
I want to plant a bomb somewhere and
have an incredible funny incident
someday.

159
00:08:29,560 --> 00:08:31,560
It's a bomb rice ball.

160
00:08:31,560 --> 00:08:33,560
It's really hard.

161
00:08:33,560 --> 00:08:34,560
I'm looking forward to it.

162
00:08:34,560 --> 00:08:39,560
Asuka's new Asuka.

163
00:08:39,560 --> 00:08:44,560
It's a very embarrassing story.

164
00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:47,560
I haven't changed my lesson shoes since
I joined.

165
00:08:47,560 --> 00:08:54,560
When I was rehearsing in the next
position with Asuka, there was a hole in
my shoes.

166
00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:59,560
I could see the white socks and I was
hiding them all the time, but Asuka
found out.

167
00:08:59,560 --> 00:09:13,560
About a month after she found out, she
bought the same size as my feet.

168
00:09:13,560 --> 00:09:17,560
She bought it for me and I'm still using
it.

169
00:09:17,560 --> 00:09:19,560
At that time, I said,

170
00:09:19,560 --> 00:09:22,560
Don't stop until this hole opens.

171
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:25,560
She said,

172
00:09:25,560 --> 00:09:29,560
I can't stop until this hole opens.

173
00:09:29,560 --> 00:09:33,560
I was so happy that I had no right to
stop.

174
00:09:33,560 --> 00:09:38,560
I like Kubo.

175
00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:42,560
I think it's easier to understand how to
worry and how to feel down.

176
00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:46,560
I think I'm the one who listens to the
story.

177
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:51,560
I think Kubo has a lot of those
characteristics.

178
00:09:51,560 --> 00:09:55,560
I think he's forgotten what he did.

179
00:09:55,560 --> 00:10:01,344
I don't think he's been taking care of
me much.

180
00:10:02,344 --> 00:10:04,344
Asuka's one word for Kubo.

181
00:10:05,344 --> 00:10:09,344
Kubo is the best translucent.

182
00:10:10,344 --> 00:10:11,344
What?

183
00:10:13,344 --> 00:10:15,344
She's happy but not happy.

184
00:10:16,344 --> 00:10:19,344
In a good way, he has love.

185
00:10:19,344 --> 00:10:22,344
I always think that Kubo is not good at
something.

186
00:10:23,344 --> 00:10:24,344
But Kubo can do anything.

187
00:10:24,344 --> 00:10:29,344
Singing, dancing, acting, he can do
anything.

188
00:10:29,344 --> 00:10:34,344
If he shows his true self, it's too
bright for us.

189
00:10:35,344 --> 00:10:37,344
So I think he's trying to suppress it.

190
00:10:37,344 --> 00:10:39,344
He's giving half of everything.

191
00:10:40,344 --> 00:10:45,344
He's giving only half of the happiness
that all humans can get.

192
00:10:45,344 --> 00:10:51,344
But I think he's cute and talented in
translucent.

193
00:10:51,344 --> 00:10:53,344
He's the best.

194
00:10:53,344 --> 00:10:55,984
What is Kubo's true self?

195
00:10:56,984 --> 00:11:01,984
I was the first one to stand in the
center.

196
00:11:01,984 --> 00:11:07,984
I was the first one to perform as an
influencer.

197
00:11:07,984 --> 00:11:14,984
I was the first one to be off the
microphone during a live broadcast.

198
00:11:14,984 --> 00:11:17,984
I was in a lot of trouble.

199
00:11:17,984 --> 00:11:20,984
I made a big mistake.

200
00:11:20,984 --> 00:11:27,984
I was angry at myself for not being able
to tell anyone.

201
00:11:27,984 --> 00:11:30,984
I got a call.

202
00:11:30,984 --> 00:11:32,984
I was frustrated.

203
00:11:32,984 --> 00:11:40,984
I thought I was the only one who could
be an influencer.

204
00:11:40,984 --> 00:11:42,984
I got a lot of calls.

205
00:11:42,984 --> 00:11:45,984
I got a lot of calls.

206
00:11:45,984 --> 00:11:50,984
I remember that call the most.

207
00:11:50,984 --> 00:11:58,984
I wanted to be able to be a person who
can be a double center.

208
00:11:58,984 --> 00:12:07,984
I was able to be a person who can be a
double center because I was able to be a
double center.

209
00:12:07,984 --> 00:12:10,984
That was the start of my hard work.

210
00:12:10,984 --> 00:12:13,984
I was chosen as a new face after that.

211
00:12:13,984 --> 00:12:17,984
I knew that I was not as good as her.

212
00:12:17,984 --> 00:12:21,984
But I was able to catch up with her.

213
00:12:21,984 --> 00:12:25,984
That was the start of my hard work.

214
00:12:25,984 --> 00:12:31,984
She gave me the best advice at the best
time.

215
00:12:31,984 --> 00:12:40,984
Yamashita said the first thing she felt
lonely when she announced her
graduation.

216
00:12:40,984 --> 00:12:42,984
I was surprised.

217
00:12:42,984 --> 00:12:46,984
I thought I was able to predict her
graduation.

218
00:12:46,984 --> 00:12:49,984
I thought she would not think anything.

219
00:12:49,984 --> 00:12:51,984
She cried a lot.

220
00:12:51,984 --> 00:12:55,984
She said, isn't it too early?

221
00:12:55,984 --> 00:12:59,120
I was happy.

222
00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:02,688
Mizuki Yamashita's one word labeling

223
00:13:02,688 --> 00:13:04,688
Captain Humebaki.

224
00:13:08,688 --> 00:13:09,688
That's a bad word.

225
00:13:09,688 --> 00:13:11,688
He always has his eyes wide open.

226
00:13:11,688 --> 00:13:12,688
He's praising you.

227
00:13:12,688 --> 00:13:16,688
He always appears in the dorm.

228
00:13:16,688 --> 00:13:19,688
He's always in the rough.

229
00:13:19,688 --> 00:13:21,688
He's always doing his best.

230
00:13:21,688 --> 00:13:24,688
He's always doing his best.

231
00:13:24,688 --> 00:13:26,688
That's why he's Captain Humebaki.

232
00:13:26,688 --> 00:13:30,688
He's the captain of Yamashita Maru now.

233
00:13:30,688 --> 00:13:32,688
He's been doing his best in Asadora.

234
00:13:32,688 --> 00:13:34,688
That's what makes him great.

235
00:13:34,688 --> 00:13:37,688
If Yamashita, the third and fourth
generation,

236
00:13:37,688 --> 00:13:39,688
become the leader,

237
00:13:39,688 --> 00:13:45,688
I want him to be the captain of Nogizaka
Maru.

238
00:13:45,688 --> 00:13:51,728
I want Yamashita to do his best.

239
00:13:52,728 --> 00:13:54,728
Asuka in Asuka.

240
00:13:54,728 --> 00:13:55,728
Asuka in the world.

241
00:13:55,728 --> 00:13:56,728
Asuka in Asuka.

242
00:13:56,728 --> 00:13:59,728
You were really mad at me.

243
00:13:59,728 --> 00:14:02,728
I don't remember the adrenaline.

244
00:14:02,728 --> 00:14:03,728
But I was so happy.

245
00:14:03,728 --> 00:14:06,728
I kept saying, please make me mad again.

246
00:14:06,728 --> 00:14:11,312
If you don't listen to this, it will be
an odd story.

247
00:14:12,312 --> 00:14:14,312
I think I'm the most involved in the
group.

248
00:14:15,312 --> 00:14:19,312
I don't want to say that I have a lot of
memories with Asuka.

249
00:14:20,312 --> 00:14:22,312
Asuka is a very different person.

250
00:14:23,312 --> 00:14:27,312
I don't want to say it myself.

251
00:14:28,312 --> 00:14:33,312
When I was in the middle of my own, I
was chosen as the first selection.

252
00:14:34,312 --> 00:14:37,312
I didn't talk to her at all.

253
00:14:37,312 --> 00:14:42,312
After the National Academy of Arts, I
got an email.

254
00:14:43,312 --> 00:14:46,312
I'm not interested in people.

255
00:14:47,312 --> 00:14:51,312
I was told that I had high expectations
for the Donezawa family.

256
00:14:52,312 --> 00:14:56,312
I didn't talk to her at all.

257
00:14:57,312 --> 00:14:58,312
I was very happy.

258
00:14:59,312 --> 00:15:01,312
I was doing my best to see it.

259
00:15:02,312 --> 00:15:03,312
I wasn't confident.

260
00:15:04,312 --> 00:15:05,312
That's not kindness.

261
00:15:05,312 --> 00:15:07,312
I think she's really like that.

262
00:15:08,312 --> 00:15:14,312
I'm the only one who stayed overnight
with Ume.

263
00:15:15,312 --> 00:15:17,312
I'm wrong.

264
00:15:18,312 --> 00:15:19,312
I did a video call.

265
00:15:20,312 --> 00:15:22,312
I talked to Ume for the first time.

266
00:15:23,312 --> 00:15:25,312
I thought it was interesting.

267
00:15:26,312 --> 00:15:31,312
I told the staff that this person is
interesting.

268
00:15:31,312 --> 00:15:40,312
I was happy that Ume was evaluated by
various people and became a captain.

269
00:15:41,312 --> 00:15:42,312
I'm proud of it.

270
00:15:43,312 --> 00:15:48,312
I was a junior at the time, but I was
spoiled.

271
00:15:49,312 --> 00:15:54,312
I went home because of that.

272
00:15:55,312 --> 00:15:57,312
Asuka is a lonely person.

273
00:15:57,312 --> 00:16:02,312
I bought a birthday present for Asuka
the day before her birthday.

274
00:16:03,312 --> 00:16:04,312
She said,

275
00:16:05,312 --> 00:16:08,312
I'm looking forward to my birthday
tomorrow.

276
00:16:09,312 --> 00:16:11,312
I said, I know.

277
00:16:12,312 --> 00:16:13,312
She's cute.

278
00:16:14,312 --> 00:16:17,312
I'm happy to see Asuka being spoiled.

279
00:16:18,312 --> 00:16:19,312
I'm really happy.

280
00:16:20,312 --> 00:16:21,312
Thank you.

281
00:16:22,312 --> 00:16:24,312
I want to continue this relationship.

282
00:16:24,312 --> 00:16:29,312
I like Ume being spoiled.

283
00:16:30,312 --> 00:16:33,312
Ume is a lovely type.

284
00:16:34,312 --> 00:16:35,312
Is it a little big?

285
00:16:36,312 --> 00:16:37,312
Wait a minute.

286
00:16:38,312 --> 00:16:41,312
I have a lot of one-sided love.

287
00:16:44,312 --> 00:16:45,312
What do you mean?

288
00:16:46,312 --> 00:16:49,312
Ume has a great presence.

289
00:16:49,312 --> 00:16:56,312
He's hiding his presence, but he's very
particular about his makeup.

290
00:16:57,312 --> 00:17:04,312
Ume is also very particular about
beauty.

291
00:17:05,312 --> 00:17:06,312
He's a good person.

292
00:17:08,312 --> 00:17:14,312
I don't know at all, but I have the
image of bringing a lot of people
together.

293
00:17:14,312 --> 00:17:20,312
I want Ume to be a good person.

294
00:17:21,312 --> 00:17:22,312
Asuka's hot pot.

295
00:17:23,312 --> 00:17:24,312
Asuka in Asuka.

296
00:17:25,312 --> 00:17:26,312
What's in it?

297
00:17:26,312 --> 00:17:29,424
If you assist us, we will be very happy.

298
00:17:30,424 --> 00:17:32,424
I feel like I'm a different person.

299
00:17:33,424 --> 00:17:36,424
I feel like there are more pure girls
than I thought.

300
00:17:37,424 --> 00:17:38,424
That's why I feel like I'm being
attacked.

301
00:17:39,424 --> 00:17:43,424
Everyone knows me like this.

302
00:17:44,424 --> 00:17:49,424
I may get cold reactions from people.

303
00:17:50,424 --> 00:17:52,424
But I still contact them and say,

304
00:17:52,424 --> 00:17:57,424
I'm so cute.

305
00:17:58,424 --> 00:18:02,424
I felt like I was a big part of the
group.

306
00:18:03,424 --> 00:18:07,424
I feel like I'm a new wind.

307
00:18:08,424 --> 00:18:12,424
And the five students are talking about
their memories with Asuka.

308
00:18:13,424 --> 00:18:16,424
I started playing the drums because I
admired Asuka.

309
00:18:17,424 --> 00:18:18,424
I'm a fan.

310
00:18:18,424 --> 00:18:19,424
I'm a fan.

311
00:18:20,424 --> 00:18:21,424
I'm a fan.

312
00:18:22,424 --> 00:18:24,424
I send letters on Sundays.

313
00:18:25,424 --> 00:18:26,424
I'm a fan.

314
00:18:27,424 --> 00:18:28,424
I'm a fan.

315
00:18:29,424 --> 00:18:30,424
I've never heard of it.

316
00:18:31,424 --> 00:18:33,424
Have you ever taken a picture with
Asuka?

317
00:18:34,424 --> 00:18:35,424
No.

318
00:18:36,424 --> 00:18:37,424
I've never.

319
00:18:38,424 --> 00:18:40,424
I'm the only one who can boast.

320
00:18:41,424 --> 00:18:45,424
I think I'm the only one who took a
picture with her.

321
00:18:45,424 --> 00:18:48,424
I took a picture with her once.

322
00:18:49,424 --> 00:18:50,424
You were hiding it.

323
00:18:51,424 --> 00:18:53,424
So, I'm the only one.

324
00:18:54,424 --> 00:18:55,424
I'm the only one.

325
00:18:56,424 --> 00:18:57,424
I'm so cute.

326
00:18:58,424 --> 00:18:59,424
I'm so cute.

327
00:18:59,424 --> 00:19:01,104
I'm the only one.

328
00:19:01,104 --> 00:19:06,104
The message that couldn't be written in
the bulletin board was added in Tokyo.

329
00:19:06,448 --> 00:19:11,448
Ogawa is Asuka who reaches her
grandchild's age.

330
00:19:11,448 --> 00:19:13,448
I don't know what that means.

331
00:19:13,448 --> 00:19:15,448
What is that?

332
00:19:17,448 --> 00:19:23,448
When I was introduced to him, he said I
looked like Asuka.

333
00:19:23,448 --> 00:19:28,448
I apologized to him, saying I'm sorry.

334
00:19:28,448 --> 00:19:31,448
I apologized to him, saying I'm sorry
that I'm cute.

335
00:19:31,448 --> 00:19:35,448
But he was very happy about it.

336
00:19:35,448 --> 00:19:41,448
He's been so nice to me since I started
playing drums.

337
00:19:41,448 --> 00:19:44,448
I think he's cute like a grandchild.

338
00:19:44,448 --> 00:19:50,448
I'm glad that Asuka has reached such a
young age.

339
00:19:50,448 --> 00:19:53,448
I'm often asked to talk to him.

340
00:19:53,448 --> 00:19:56,448
But when I go to talk to him, he cries.

341
00:19:56,448 --> 00:20:07,448
I remember a flashback of a girl who
came to me and cried.

342
00:20:07,448 --> 00:20:15,448
I want to talk to him again, but I'm
afraid I'll cry again.

343
00:20:15,448 --> 00:20:19,448
I talk to him a little bit.

344
00:20:19,448 --> 00:20:26,448
The first time I talked to him, he
refused to give me a watermelon.

345
00:20:26,448 --> 00:20:27,448
Why?

346
00:20:27,448 --> 00:20:29,448
I was depressed.

347
00:20:29,448 --> 00:20:32,448
I asked him if he wanted to eat it, and
he said he didn't want it.

348
00:20:32,448 --> 00:20:37,448
I was crying, and he was smiling.

349
00:20:37,448 --> 00:20:40,448
He was smiling with me.

350
00:20:40,448 --> 00:20:42,448
I thought he was a good guy.

351
00:20:42,448 --> 00:20:45,448
He didn't look like he was crying.

352
00:20:45,448 --> 00:20:48,448
He was honest.

353
00:20:48,448 --> 00:20:50,448
He said he didn't want it.

354
00:20:50,448 --> 00:20:53,448
His nickname is Akutori Daikichi.

355
00:20:53,448 --> 00:20:54,448
What?

356
00:20:55,448 --> 00:20:58,448
Akutori Daikichi?

357
00:20:58,448 --> 00:21:00,448
There's a nickname called Shokichi.

358
00:21:00,448 --> 00:21:04,448
I thought that nickname was perfect.

359
00:21:04,448 --> 00:21:07,448
I'm so jealous of that nickname.

360
00:21:07,448 --> 00:21:10,448
I think Shitara is a genius.

361
00:21:10,448 --> 00:21:14,448
I think Daikichi is the one who can get
such a nickname.

362
00:21:14,448 --> 00:21:20,448
I think Daikichi will be a great person
someday.

363
00:21:20,448 --> 00:21:25,448
Akutori has a strong personality.

364
00:21:25,448 --> 00:21:29,448
I'm wondering how to put it together.

365
00:21:29,448 --> 00:21:33,448
Sugawara is also an MC.

366
00:21:33,448 --> 00:21:50,448
I think Sugawara's MC is a person who
can express the strong personality of
the MC.

367
00:21:50,448 --> 00:21:56,608
Who will be the next MC?

368
00:21:56,608 --> 00:22:02,608
Nakanishi has a great sense of humor and
a calm personality.

369
00:22:02,608 --> 00:22:06,608
Nakanishi is a person who is very calm
and calm.

370
00:22:06,608 --> 00:22:09,608
I think he has a great sense of humor,

371
00:22:09,608 --> 00:22:16,608
such as the content of his speech, the
sentences he writes, and the way he
looks at people.

372
00:22:16,608 --> 00:22:20,608
I think he has a very funny personality.

373
00:22:20,608 --> 00:22:27,608
But I think that his personality is
twisted, so I don't think he will be
accepted by the audience.

374
00:22:27,608 --> 00:22:33,608
But I think he will be stronger if he
conveys his personality.

375
00:22:33,608 --> 00:22:37,608
It's difficult for him to convey his
personality.

376
00:22:37,608 --> 00:22:40,608
He is a very normal person,

377
00:22:40,608 --> 00:22:47,608
so he has a great sense of humor and a
calm personality.

378
00:22:47,608 --> 00:22:52,608
If he can do that, he will be a very
interesting person.

379
00:22:52,608 --> 00:22:55,608
He is an idol, or rather, he is a very
interesting person.

380
00:22:55,608 --> 00:23:00,608
I think he will be a person who does not
fit in the framework of an idol.

381
00:23:00,608 --> 00:23:05,608
Anyway, I want him to do his best to
convey his personality.

382
00:23:05,608 --> 00:23:09,608
I think it's a little weird to say that
he is too kind.

383
00:23:09,608 --> 00:23:13,608
Before I did the actual performance at
the Nissan Stadium,

384
00:23:13,608 --> 00:23:18,608
I was alone in the backstage.

385
00:23:18,608 --> 00:23:23,608
At that time, Asuka came to me.

386
00:23:23,608 --> 00:23:26,608
I didn't ask her, Are you okay?

387
00:23:26,608 --> 00:23:31,608
I asked her, Are you okay?

388
00:23:31,608 --> 00:23:34,608
I think she made me feel better.

389
00:23:34,608 --> 00:23:43,608
I've been helped a lot, so I don't have
anything in return.

390
00:23:43,608 --> 00:23:55,608
I've been helped too much, so I'm sad
that I'm graduating without anything in
return.

391
00:23:55,608 --> 00:24:01,608
After this, Asuka finally made a hit
with Asuka.

392
00:24:04,344 --> 00:24:08,344
I'm going to say some bad things about
her.

393
00:24:09,344 --> 00:24:14,344
But her shoe episode was a super star
episode.

394
00:24:15,344 --> 00:24:18,344
And she was poor, so she was in trouble.

395
00:24:19,344 --> 00:24:21,344
She wore a shoe with a hole in it.

396
00:24:21,344 --> 00:24:23,344
It was like a Takeshita episode.

397
00:24:23,344 --> 00:24:26,344
Everyone told me to use it if it sold.

398
00:24:26,344 --> 00:24:29,344
Asuka is amazing.

399
00:24:29,344 --> 00:24:34,344
At first, she was like a baby.

400
00:24:34,344 --> 00:24:37,344
But she's grown up a lot.

401
00:24:37,344 --> 00:24:39,344
Asuka is a good girl.

402
00:24:40,344 --> 00:24:44,344
I laughed at her, but I felt
comfortable.

403
00:24:45,344 --> 00:24:50,344
Birthday Live will be held at 4days in
February.

404
00:24:50,344 --> 00:24:55,344
Under Live tickets will be available
from December 10th.

405
00:24:55,344 --> 00:24:59,344
Next, the tearful episode.

406
00:25:03,312 --> 00:25:10,312
I'm sorry for facing the camera.

407
00:25:10,312 --> 00:25:19,312
I'm sorry for my costume being torn when
I danced hard during the live.

408
00:25:19,312 --> 00:25:35,312
