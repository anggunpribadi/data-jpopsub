During the construction of Nogizaka this time, "Prayer for the 31st single hit"!
Saito Asuka, who graduated with this single, travels alone to spin her feelings for the members
Asuka, who has seen the entire history of Nogizaka46 since its formation, thinks of a passionate message for each remaining member.
Along with praying for a single hit, we will pray for the future of Nogizaka46 in a place related to Asuka.
Asuka's last hit prayer! The last is a sudden development of tears!
