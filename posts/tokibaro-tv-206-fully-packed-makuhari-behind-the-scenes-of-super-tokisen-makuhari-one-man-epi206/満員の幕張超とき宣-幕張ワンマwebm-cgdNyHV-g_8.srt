1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,000
We used to give out tissues at the
station near Makairi Messe, and we used
to do free live shows at Iomola Makairi
Shintoshin.

2
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:17,000
At that time, I said that I would do a
live show at Makairi Messe someday.

3
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:24,000
I'm really surprised that it's now
coming true.

4
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:35,000
It's not only fun, but we've been able
to overcome everything and keep running
towards our dreams.

5
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:42,000
It's really hard to join a group that
has already existed, but I think it's a
great thing to join.

6
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:56,000
Julia, Aki-chan, who decided to join us,
the staff who always thinks about us and
supports us, and the kind publicity
staff who have always been there.

7
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:15,000
I'm really grateful to everyone who is
here.

8
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:41,946
Thank you for your support.

9
00:01:41,946 --> 00:01:43,946
I'll do my best.

10
00:01:53,818 --> 00:01:55,818
I'm going to the hospital.

11
00:01:55,818 --> 00:01:57,818
That's all.

12
00:01:57,818 --> 00:01:59,818
I'm going to the hospital.

13
00:01:59,818 --> 00:02:01,818
I'm going to the hospital.

14
00:02:01,818 --> 00:02:13,178
I'm going to the hospital.

15
00:02:13,178 --> 00:02:22,178
Thank you for coming to the Super
Exciting Advertising Club in Makuhari
Messe.

16
00:02:22,178 --> 00:02:26,178
I'm Minako Tanami, the leader of the
Super Exciting Crew.

17
00:02:26,178 --> 00:02:29,664
Thank you.

18
00:02:29,664 --> 00:02:34,664
We would like to ask you to pay
attention to the following.

19
00:02:34,664 --> 00:02:41,664
We would like to say that the photo
shooting, recording, and photographing
in the venue are strictly prohibited.

20
00:02:41,664 --> 00:02:46,664
You can stand up and enjoy yourself
within your seat during the performance.

21
00:02:46,664 --> 00:02:51,664
You cannot watch the performance while
standing up.

22
00:02:51,664 --> 00:02:55,664
We would like to ask you to sit down and
enjoy the performance.

23
00:02:55,664 --> 00:03:00,664
You are not allowed to make a loud voice
during the performance.

24
00:03:00,664 --> 00:03:04,664
You are allowed to clap your hands and
enjoy the performance.

25
00:03:04,664 --> 00:03:10,664
We would like to ask you to pay
attention to the following.

26
00:03:11,568 --> 00:03:16,168
Anyway everyone, I will start soon

27
00:03:16,828 --> 00:03:18,068
Ehehe

28
00:03:20,188 --> 00:03:21,868
I am definitely organising the entrance.

29
00:03:21,868 --> 00:03:23,208
Dad!

30
00:03:24,248 --> 00:03:26,248
Hello everyone!

31
00:03:26,208 --> 00:03:28,368
This is Hori's late birthday speech

32
00:03:28,368 --> 00:03:30,928
I was looking forward to this day

33
00:03:30,928 --> 00:03:35,088
Because everyone is there, we can stand
on the stage today

34
00:03:35,088 --> 00:03:39,088
Let's make the best live together!

35
00:03:39,088 --> 00:03:41,808
Thank you for today!

36
00:03:41,808 --> 00:03:45,008
Then wait for me!

37
00:03:45,008 --> 00:03:48,048
Oh my god, oh my god, oh my god, oh my
god

38
00:03:48,048 --> 00:03:48,848
What's wrong? What's wrong?

39
00:03:48,848 --> 00:03:49,808
I was there!

40
00:03:49,808 --> 00:03:50,608
I was there!

41
00:03:50,608 --> 00:03:51,248
What's wrong?

42
00:03:51,248 --> 00:03:52,288
Oh, sorry, sorry, sorry

43
00:03:52,288 --> 00:03:53,168
It's okay, it's okay

44
00:03:53,168 --> 00:03:57,568
It's definitely different, it's
completely different

45
00:03:58,568 --> 00:04:00,568
Let's enjoy it together.

46
00:04:01,568 --> 00:04:03,568
Let's enjoy it.

47
00:04:03,568 --> 00:04:05,568
Let's do our best.

48
00:04:05,568 --> 00:04:07,568
Let's enjoy it.

49
00:04:08,616 --> 00:04:12,616
Kanami, Junia, Hitoka, Haruka, Aki,
Hiyori.

50
00:04:12,616 --> 00:04:14,616
We are Takimeki Senden.

51
00:04:14,616 --> 00:04:37,616
Go!

52
00:04:37,658 --> 00:04:39,658
Let's go.

53
00:04:39,658 --> 00:04:41,658
Can you do this?

54
00:04:41,658 --> 00:04:43,658
We'll do our best!

55
00:04:43,658 --> 00:04:45,658
Let's have fun!

56
00:04:45,658 --> 00:04:47,658
Let's have fun!

57
00:04:47,658 --> 00:04:49,658
Thank you for watching.

58
00:05:06,842 --> 00:05:09,842
This was a promise.

59
00:06:31,110 --> 00:06:35,610
Thank you for watching!

60
00:06:37,594 --> 00:06:43,314
Singing in a boy group

61
00:06:51,434 --> 00:06:55,434
It is a truly realistic atmosphere.

62
00:06:55,434 --> 00:07:07,434
It was the most beautiful fan live I've
ever seen.

63
00:07:07,434 --> 00:07:09,434
I'm glad I've been able to continue this
far.

64
00:07:09,434 --> 00:07:13,434
I think it was a live that I could feel
again.

65
00:07:13,434 --> 00:07:15,434
I'm having fun with the internet.

66
00:07:15,434 --> 00:07:19,434
It's always in our hearts.

67
00:07:19,434 --> 00:07:29,434
I hope I can continue to update and see
a lot of beautiful scenery.

68
00:07:29,434 --> 00:07:33,434
Let's make the best live together.

69
00:07:33,434 --> 00:07:46,434
At the center stage, there were four
screens for 360 degrees.

70
00:07:46,434 --> 00:07:49,434
I saw the penlight through the screen.

71
00:07:49,434 --> 00:07:53,434
I thought it was our live.

72
00:07:53,434 --> 00:07:56,434
I saw a lot of lights.

73
00:07:56,434 --> 00:08:00,434
All the members were surprised.

74
00:08:00,434 --> 00:08:08,434
Before the first song started, we all
went into our own world and shared our
feelings.

75
00:08:08,434 --> 00:08:11,434
It was a dreamlike time.

76
00:08:11,434 --> 00:08:24,434
I thought it was a long time, but it was
a very short time.

77
00:08:24,434 --> 00:08:30,434
It was a very short time.

78
00:08:30,434 --> 00:08:38,434
I was able to realize that it was a
great memory.

79
00:08:38,434 --> 00:08:40,434
It was a strange time.

80
00:08:40,434 --> 00:08:47,434
I was able to shine a lot of lights with
the penlight.

81
00:08:47,434 --> 00:08:54,434
I performed my best to answer the power
of the penlight.

82
00:08:54,434 --> 00:08:57,434
Did you enjoy it?

83
00:08:57,434 --> 00:09:01,434
I couldn't have done it without Sendai
V.

84
00:09:01,434 --> 00:09:04,434
I'm really grateful to everyone.

85
00:09:04,434 --> 00:09:06,434
Thank you very much.

86
00:09:06,434 --> 00:09:09,434
I want to go back to the WAKUHARI MUSE.

87
00:09:09,434 --> 00:09:18,434
I want to do my best to go to a bigger
stage.

88
00:09:18,434 --> 00:09:23,434
I will do my best to keep up with you.

89
00:09:23,434 --> 00:09:26,434
Let's go together.

90
00:09:26,434 --> 00:09:29,434
Let's go to a bigger stage.

91
00:09:29,434 --> 00:09:31,434
Please follow me.

92
00:09:31,434 --> 00:09:33,434
Thank you very much.

93
00:09:33,434 --> 00:09:46,434
When I stood by, there were more
penlights than I imagined.

94
00:09:46,434 --> 00:09:56,434
I thought there were many people who
supported us.

95
00:09:56,434 --> 00:10:08,434
I was happy to see that there were
people who wanted to see us.

96
00:10:08,434 --> 00:10:14,434
I was looking forward to the rehearsal.

97
00:10:14,434 --> 00:10:20,434
I was looking forward to the rehearsal.

98
00:10:20,434 --> 00:10:28,434
I was happy to perform on stage.

99
00:10:28,434 --> 00:10:34,434
I was able to stand on stage with
confidence.

100
00:10:34,434 --> 00:10:38,434
I was worried about what to do if I sang
the wrong song.

101
00:10:38,434 --> 00:10:41,434
I was worried about my hair.

102
00:10:41,434 --> 00:10:45,434
Sometimes I lost confidence.

103
00:10:45,434 --> 00:10:50,434
I was able to stand on stage with
confidence.

104
00:10:50,434 --> 00:10:55,434
I think everyone enjoyed it.

105
00:10:55,434 --> 00:10:57,434
It was a lot of fun.

106
00:10:57,434 --> 00:11:01,434
When I went to the second floor of the
TROCK,

107
00:11:01,434 --> 00:11:09,434
everyone was waving their hands and were
happy.

108
00:11:09,434 --> 00:11:13,434
I was able to see a happy face.

109
00:11:13,434 --> 00:11:19,434
I was glad to be an idol.

110
00:11:19,434 --> 00:11:23,434
I think it's not natural to be asked for
so much.

111
00:11:23,434 --> 00:11:27,434
I was happy to be asked for it.

112
00:11:27,434 --> 00:11:33,434
I was aiming for the star's star.

113
00:11:33,434 --> 00:11:35,434
I was very nervous.

114
00:11:35,434 --> 00:11:40,434
I was in the middle of the stage with
Ha-chan.

115
00:11:40,434 --> 00:11:43,434
I thought it was an important scene.

116
00:11:43,434 --> 00:11:45,434
I thought I couldn't make a mistake in
timing.

117
00:11:45,434 --> 00:11:48,434
I thought I couldn't turn it over.

118
00:11:48,434 --> 00:11:50,434
I was very nervous.

119
00:11:50,434 --> 00:11:53,434
I was able to say,

120
00:11:53,434 --> 00:11:55,434
I was aiming for the star's star.

121
00:11:55,434 --> 00:12:07,434
I hope everyone thinks that I'm shining.

122
00:12:07,434 --> 00:12:11,434
I'm going to go to the second floor.

123
00:12:12,434 --> 00:12:15,434
I'm going to the second floor.

124
00:12:15,434 --> 00:12:18,848
It was fun.

125
00:12:18,848 --> 00:12:21,488
This is Gyosei.

126
00:12:22,744 --> 00:12:25,744
It was announced last December.

127
00:12:25,744 --> 00:12:27,744
It's been 10 months since then.

128
00:12:27,744 --> 00:12:30,744
I just had a live performance at
Makuhari Messe.

129
00:12:30,744 --> 00:12:33,744
There were so many people who were
promoting the song.

130
00:12:33,744 --> 00:12:37,744
There were people who were promoting the
song everywhere.

131
00:12:37,744 --> 00:12:42,744
I'm really impressed by the wonderful
scenery.

132
00:12:44,744 --> 00:12:49,744
I didn't even dream of standing on the
stage at the beginning of the festival.

133
00:12:49,744 --> 00:12:54,744
I wanted to stand on the stage, but I
didn't think I could do it.

134
00:12:54,744 --> 00:12:57,744
It was a dream come true.

135
00:12:57,744 --> 00:13:01,744
I'm not a star singer, but I thought so.

136
00:13:01,744 --> 00:13:03,744
I was able to make it happen.

137
00:13:03,744 --> 00:13:09,744
I thought there was nothing I couldn't
do with you.

138
00:13:09,744 --> 00:13:12,744
I thought there was no limit to my
dreams.

139
00:13:12,744 --> 00:13:18,744
Thank you for always supporting us and
making us stronger.

140
00:13:18,744 --> 00:13:23,744
I felt that I was helped by everyone.

141
00:13:23,744 --> 00:13:25,744
It was a miracle to meet everyone.

142
00:13:25,744 --> 00:13:27,744
I'm glad I met everyone.

143
00:13:27,744 --> 00:13:29,744
It was a day I felt strongly.

144
00:13:29,744 --> 00:13:33,504
Thank you very much.

145
00:13:33,504 --> 00:13:35,504
Thank you for your hard work.

146
00:13:35,504 --> 00:13:39,504
I remember the moment when we all came
out and said,

147
00:13:39,504 --> 00:13:41,504
Let's do our best!

148
00:13:41,504 --> 00:13:47,504
and we got on the center stage and
opened the door.

149
00:13:47,504 --> 00:13:51,504
I was so happy to be able to get on the
truck and go to see you.

150
00:13:51,504 --> 00:13:58,504
I was so happy to be able to get on the
truck and go to see you.

151
00:13:58,504 --> 00:14:03,504
There were 12 trucks in total for the
second floor.

152
00:14:03,504 --> 00:14:06,504
The set was gorgeous.

153
00:14:06,504 --> 00:14:09,504
There were two seats on the end stage.

154
00:14:09,504 --> 00:14:13,504
The people on the top of the wing
connected to the second floor.

155
00:14:13,504 --> 00:14:18,504
I was able to perform at a concert hall
of an unimaginable size,

156
00:14:18,504 --> 00:14:21,504
called Wakahari Messe.

157
00:14:21,504 --> 00:14:24,504
I was happy to be able to perform.

158
00:14:24,504 --> 00:14:29,504
I was prepared to be in trouble,

159
00:14:29,504 --> 00:14:36,504
but I couldn't hold back my excitement
when I saw you.

160
00:14:36,504 --> 00:14:40,504
I remember that moment very well.

161
00:14:40,504 --> 00:14:44,504
Thank you very much for always
supporting us.

162
00:14:44,504 --> 00:14:52,504
It's because of you that we have the
courage and confidence.

163
00:14:52,504 --> 00:14:55,504
I think it's all thanks to you.

164
00:14:55,504 --> 00:14:57,504
So, from now on...

165
00:14:59,504 --> 00:15:01,504
So, from now on...

166
00:15:01,504 --> 00:15:04,504
I'd be happy if you could continue to
support us.

167
00:15:04,504 --> 00:15:07,504
Thank you so much for today.

168
00:15:07,504 --> 00:15:11,504
Sleep well, eat delicious cookies, and
rest.

169
00:15:11,504 --> 00:15:13,504
See you next time!

170
00:15:13,504 --> 00:15:14,504
See you!

171
00:15:14,504 --> 00:15:17,200
Bye bye!

172
00:15:18,200 --> 00:15:26,200
I felt like I was in a dream that we had
a concert.

173
00:15:26,200 --> 00:15:31,200
I felt like we had a concert even after
the concert.

174
00:15:31,200 --> 00:15:34,200
I felt strange.

175
00:15:34,200 --> 00:15:41,200
But when I saw us dancing on the stage,

176
00:15:41,200 --> 00:15:48,200
I thought it was a good memory.

177
00:15:48,200 --> 00:15:52,200
We went to see everyone.

178
00:15:52,200 --> 00:16:01,200
It was the most popular one-man live
we've ever seen.

179
00:16:01,200 --> 00:16:08,200
I was prepared at first, but I was so
nervous.

180
00:16:08,200 --> 00:16:14,200
I was so nervous.

181
00:16:14,200 --> 00:16:25,200
But I was so happy that many people
thought that they wanted to see us.

182
00:16:25,200 --> 00:16:30,200
I remember it well.

183
00:16:30,200 --> 00:16:34,200
It was fun.

184
00:16:34,200 --> 00:16:41,200
There were so many different scenes in
the live.

185
00:16:41,200 --> 00:16:45,200
It was like a second.

186
00:16:45,200 --> 00:16:51,200
I want to go home and look back on it.

187
00:16:51,200 --> 00:16:53,200
I like the encore.

188
00:16:53,200 --> 00:16:59,200
It was a good time.

189
00:16:59,200 --> 00:17:05,200
Thank you for watching the live.

190
00:17:05,200 --> 00:17:09,200
I was happy.

191
00:17:09,376 --> 00:17:14,376
Because I can be invincible

192
00:17:14,376 --> 00:17:21,030
Thank you for watching!

193
00:17:51,030 --> 00:18:05,030
La La La...

194
00:18:21,030 --> 00:18:26,030
La La La...

195
00:18:26,810 --> 00:18:33,810
Thank you for showing us such a
beautiful view!

196
00:18:42,202 --> 00:18:49,202
The 9th place of each block is...

197
00:18:50,202 --> 00:18:52,202
Thank you for your hard work!

198
00:18:53,202 --> 00:18:56,202

It's over.

206
00:19:21,802 --> 00:19:23,802
Oh my god.

207
00:19:23,802 --> 00:19:25,802
It's over.

208
00:19:25,802 --> 00:19:27,802
It's like a dream.

209
00:19:27,802 --> 00:19:29,802
I can't feel the time.

210
00:19:29,802 --> 00:19:31,802
Is this the time like a dream?

211
00:19:31,802 --> 00:19:33,802
My hair is not dry at all.

212
00:19:33,802 --> 00:19:35,802
Is it over?

213
00:19:35,802 --> 00:19:37,802
I can still go.

214
00:19:39,802 --> 00:19:41,802
It was really fun.

215
00:19:41,802 --> 00:19:43,802
It was really fun.

216
00:19:45,802 --> 00:19:47,802
The moment I was on the stage,

217
00:19:47,802 --> 00:19:49,802
there were so many people.

218
00:19:49,802 --> 00:19:51,802
There were so many people.

219
00:19:53,802 --> 00:19:55,802
I was so happy.

220
00:19:55,802 --> 00:19:57,802
I cried.

221
00:19:57,802 --> 00:19:59,802
Everyone was crying.

222
00:19:59,802 --> 00:20:01,802
Everyone was crying when we were on the
stage.

223
00:20:01,802 --> 00:20:03,802
I cried.

224
00:20:03,802 --> 00:20:05,802
It was wonderful.

225
00:20:05,802 --> 00:20:07,802
I want to do it again.

226
00:20:07,802 --> 00:20:09,802

227
00:20:09,802 --> 00:20:11,802

The tour was announced.

229
00:20:13,802 --> 00:20:15,802
20,000 people will be in the same place.

230

It was beautiful.

238
00:20:31,802 --> 00:20:33,802
The scenery of the sea of ​​Andite.

239
00:20:33,802 --> 00:20:35,802
That's right.

240
00:20:35,802 --> 00:20:37,802
It was really clear up to the top.

241
00:20:39,802 --> 00:20:41,802
There was no gap.

242
00:20:41,802 --> 00:20:43,802
I was so happy.

243
00:20:43,802 --> 00:20:45,802
No matter where I wave my hand,

244
00:20:45,802 --> 00:20:47,802
someone will definitely wave it back.

245
00:20:49,802 --> 00:20:51,802
I wanted to be more visible.

246
00:20:53,802 --> 00:20:55,802

See you again.

254
00:21:13,608 --> 00:21:17,608
The world is shining

255
00:21:17,608 --> 00:21:21,608
I can turn my umbrella and be relaxed

256
00:21:21,608 --> 00:21:25,608
I can't walk without it

257
00:21:25,608 --> 00:21:28,608
Someone is crying somewhere

258
00:21:28,608 --> 00:21:30,608
I'll get wet somewhere again

259
00:21:30,608 --> 00:21:33,608
I hope it's not cold

260
00:21:33,608 --> 00:21:36,608
Someone is crying somewhere

261
00:21:36,608 --> 00:21:42,608
I want to share my feelings

262
00:21:42,608 --> 00:21:46,608
I still have a view in front of me

263
00:21:46,608 --> 00:21:51,608
Let's go anywhere

264
00:21:52,880 --> 00:21:57,080
Goodbye, goodbye, thank you for
yesterday

265
00:21:57,080 --> 00:22:01,180
The city after the rain is colorful

266
00:22:01,180 --> 00:22:05,380
I'll draw a fragment of the future on
the canvas of my damaged heart

267
00:22:05,380 --> 00:22:25,380
It will lead me to you

268
00:22:25,466 --> 00:22:30,466
I can say it now, the reason for my
tears

269
00:22:30,466 --> 00:22:34,466
When I'm lost, I remember right away

270
00:22:34,466 --> 00:22:38,466
Even if it rains, I'll smile

271
00:22:38,466 --> 00:22:42,466
Look, let's go anywhere

272
00:22:42,466 --> 00:22:46,466
Goodbye, goodbye, to me of yesterday

273
00:22:46,466 --> 00:22:50,466
The city lights after the rain are
sparkling

274
00:22:50,466 --> 00:22:54,466
My heart is like a sunny day, the sound
of the rain drops

275
00:22:54,466 --> 00:22:58,466
I play the rainbow piano

276
00:22:58,466 --> 00:23:03,466
Goodbye, goodbye, to me of yesterday

277
00:23:03,466 --> 00:23:07,466
The city lights after the rain are
sparkling

278
00:23:07,466 --> 00:23:11,466

of the rain drops

279
