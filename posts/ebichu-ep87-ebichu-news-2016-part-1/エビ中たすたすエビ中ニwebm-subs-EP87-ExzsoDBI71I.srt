00:00:00,602 --> 00:00:06,602
This week, we have the big news for the
new year, Ebichu Tastasu!

2
00:00:06,602 --> 00:00:07,602
And so...

3
00:00:10,602 --> 00:00:11,602
Mayama-chan!

4
00:00:13,602 --> 00:00:15,602
Mayama's new catchphrase has been born!

5
00:00:15,602 --> 00:00:20,864
Ebichu Tastasu, start!

6
00:00:20,864 --> 00:00:31,864
Ikemo Nante Mo Irarenai Modokashii
Kanjou Kakeru Hyaku

7
00:00:33,818 --> 00:00:35,818
I'm so into you that I can't stop

8
00:00:35,818 --> 00:00:40,818
What should I do with my heart?

9
00:00:41,818 --> 00:00:44,818
Monotrium, Monotrium, Monotrium

10
00:00:44,818 --> 00:00:46,818
Middle school, Monotrium

11
00:00:46,818 --> 00:00:50,818
Try adding various things to private
Ebisu Middle School

12
00:00:51,818 --> 00:00:55,818
Ebisu Middle School

13
00:00:55,818 --> 00:00:57,818
Why?

14
00:00:57,818 --> 00:00:58,426
I'm so into you that I can't stop

15
00:00:58,426 --> 00:01:03,426
This program is brought to you by the
following sponsors.

16
00:01:12,154 --> 00:01:14,154
It's cold.

17
00:01:15,770 --> 00:01:18,770
Today, we are at the Wangan Studio

18
00:01:18,770 --> 00:01:22,570
Mirei-chan, since when have you been
absent from university?

19
00:01:23,070 --> 00:01:24,070
I'm Mirei

20
00:01:24,170 --> 00:01:26,770
You have a smaller face than usual today

21
00:01:28,070 --> 00:01:29,770
You don't have legs

22
00:01:29,770 --> 00:01:30,770
I have a little

23
00:01:30,770 --> 00:01:34,770
Is it because Hoshina is absent today?

24
00:01:34,770 --> 00:01:37,770
I'm absent from university today

25
00:01:37,770 --> 00:01:39,770
It's been a long time since I saw a
mannequin

26
00:01:39,770 --> 00:01:42,770
You have a smaller face than usual

27
00:01:42,770 --> 00:01:43,770
It's very small

28
00:01:43,770 --> 00:01:46,770
What are you going to do today?

29
00:01:46,770 --> 00:01:48,770
I'm going to announce

30
00:01:48,770 --> 00:01:53,770
It's the year-end event, Ebitu Tastasu,
the big news of 2016

31
00:01:53,770 --> 00:01:58,770
I'd like to look back on the memorable
events of this year

32
00:02:00,770 --> 00:02:01,770
You did it last year, didn't you?

33
00:02:01,770 --> 00:02:03,770
Yes, I did it last year

34
00:02:03,770 --> 00:02:09,770
Ebitu Tastasu, which had a lot of events
this year, is just a little bit away
from 2016

35
00:02:09,770 --> 00:02:16,770
So, we are going to announce the
memorable events as the big news of
Ebitu Tastasu

36
00:02:16,770 --> 00:02:20,770
The Grand Prix will be decided from the
event

37
00:02:21,770 --> 00:02:24,770
By the way, do you have any personal
news?

38
00:02:24,770 --> 00:02:25,770
Yes, we do

39
00:02:25,770 --> 00:02:27,770
Matsuno-san, what is it?

40
00:02:27,770 --> 00:02:29,770
I bought a dog

41
00:02:29,770 --> 00:02:31,770
What is it?

42
00:02:31,770 --> 00:02:32,770
It's a poodle

43
00:02:32,770 --> 00:02:34,770
Toy-toy poodle

44
00:02:34,770 --> 00:02:36,770
Why did you buy it at this timing?

45
00:02:36,770 --> 00:02:40,770
Because it's a Kameido, and you didn't
see a toy poodle?

46
00:02:40,770 --> 00:02:42,770
I saw it, but I think it has nothing to
do with it

47
00:02:42,770 --> 00:02:44,770
It has nothing to do with it?

48
00:02:44,770 --> 00:02:47,770
Hoshina has a big arm

49
00:02:47,770 --> 00:02:49,770
It's a big arm

50
00:02:49,770 --> 00:02:51,770
It's broken into pieces

51
00:02:51,770 --> 00:02:54,770
Let's get started

52
00:02:54,770 --> 00:02:58,770
Ebitu Tastasu, the big news of 2016

53
00:02:58,770 --> 00:03:01,770
The first big news is here

54
00:03:01,770 --> 00:03:03,770
What is it?

55
00:03:03,770 --> 00:03:05,072
Jyan!

56
00:03:06,072 --> 00:03:10,072
Hoshina is a college student and Mayama
is 20 years old!

57
00:03:12,072 --> 00:03:14,072
I'm really surprised

58
00:03:15,072 --> 00:03:17,072
Hoshina is also a college student

59
00:03:18,072 --> 00:03:21,072
Is there anything that changed about
Hoshina?

60
00:03:21,072 --> 00:03:23,072
Like what changed?

61
00:03:24,072 --> 00:03:28,072
Sometimes when I'm on vacation I do my
nails

62
00:03:28,072 --> 00:03:31,072
I'm like a girl's boy

63
00:03:31,072 --> 00:03:33,072
I don't know

64
00:03:34,072 --> 00:03:36,072
You were like a feather

65
00:03:37,072 --> 00:03:39,072
I was like a fluffy feather

66
00:03:40,072 --> 00:03:42,072
You were like a fluffy feather

67
00:03:43,072 --> 00:03:45,072
Where is she going?

68
00:03:47,072 --> 00:03:50,072
And Mayama's birthday is 2 days after
this show

69
00:03:53,072 --> 00:03:55,072
That's when you turned 20

70
00:03:55,072 --> 00:04:01,072
Mayama is 20 years old, so there is a
big problem

71
00:04:03,728 --> 00:04:07,648
What is the Mayama 20th problem?

72
00:04:07,648 --> 00:04:10,648
What is the catchphrase of Mayama?

73
00:04:10,648 --> 00:04:12,648
It's a high tension girl

74
00:04:12,648 --> 00:04:15,648
It's a girl at 20

75
00:04:16,648 --> 00:04:18,648
20 is a girl

76
00:04:18,648 --> 00:04:20,648
It's up to teens

77
00:04:20,648 --> 00:04:24,648
So let's make a new catchphrase

78
00:04:25,648 --> 00:04:27,648
Because you are 20

79
00:04:28,648 --> 00:04:35,648
So we will think of a catchphrase for
Mayama at 20

80
00:04:35,648 --> 00:04:40,648
Mayama will pick the catchphrase she
likes the most

81
00:04:43,288 --> 00:04:47,288
If it's quick, it will be used at the
end of the year at the university

82
00:04:48,288 --> 00:04:50,288
If you think about it properly

83
00:04:51,288 --> 00:04:52,288
Everyone, Yasumoto is not joking right?

84
00:04:52,288 --> 00:04:53,288
I'm not joking

85
00:04:54,288 --> 00:04:56,288
Ah, she's not joking

86
00:04:56,288 --> 00:04:58,288
Yasumoto's face is not joking

87
00:04:58,288 --> 00:04:59,288
I'm joking

88
00:04:59,288 --> 00:05:01,288
I'm not joking

89
00:05:01,288 --> 00:05:02,288
This is not joking

90
00:05:02,288 --> 00:05:08,192
What is the catchphrase that Yasumoto
thought seriously?

91
00:05:09,192 --> 00:05:12,192
Gari Gari Ramen Junior High School

92
00:05:13,192 --> 00:05:19,192
Leave this Gari Gari Ramen to me, and I
want junior high school students to do
this

93
00:05:20,192 --> 00:05:21,192
Yasumoto, you're not joking right?

94
00:05:21,192 --> 00:05:22,192
I'm joking

95
00:05:23,192 --> 00:05:24,192
I'm joking!

96
00:05:24,192 --> 00:05:26,192
Why are you so angry?

97
00:05:26,192 --> 00:05:28,192
I'm not joking, I'm serious

98
00:05:28,192 --> 00:05:29,192
You're serious right?

99
00:05:29,192 --> 00:05:30,192
I'm serious

100
00:05:30,192 --> 00:05:35,192
Next is Hirota's catchphrase

101
00:05:36,792 --> 00:05:40,792
Muscle, muscular, angel, doll

102
00:05:40,792 --> 00:05:42,792
That's good

103
00:05:42,792 --> 00:05:43,792
That's good

104
00:05:43,792 --> 00:05:45,792
It's perfect for Ayama

105
00:05:45,792 --> 00:05:47,792
Girl is impossible but doll is

106
00:05:47,792 --> 00:05:49,792
I see, you're stepping on the line

107
00:05:49,792 --> 00:05:51,792
Girl is possible

108
00:05:51,792 --> 00:05:53,792
Girl is impossible but doll is

109
00:05:53,792 --> 00:05:54,792
Girl is possible

110
00:05:54,792 --> 00:05:55,792
Give up on girl

111
00:05:55,792 --> 00:05:57,792
Why?

112
00:05:57,792 --> 00:06:03,792
Next is Kobayashi Kouan's catchphrase

113
00:06:05,368 --> 00:06:07,368
Teenager middle school student, Mayama T

114
00:06:08,368 --> 00:06:10,368
What is Mayama T?

115
00:06:11,368 --> 00:06:13,368
20 is 20, right?

116
00:06:13,368 --> 00:06:15,368
That's why I wrote Mayama

117
00:06:15,368 --> 00:06:16,368
I see

118
00:06:16,368 --> 00:06:17,368
I think this is good too

119
00:06:17,368 --> 00:06:18,368
Thank you

120
00:06:18,368 --> 00:06:19,368
That's good

121
00:06:19,368 --> 00:06:20,368
T is T

122
00:06:22,368 --> 00:06:23,368
Mayama T is 5

123
00:06:23,368 --> 00:06:24,368
You are tied up to that

124
00:06:24,368 --> 00:06:30,368
What is Nakayama Kouan's catchphrase?

125
00:06:32,312 --> 00:06:35,312
Ebichu's Hosomatcho 3

126
00:06:35,312 --> 00:06:37,312
What is 3?

127
00:06:37,312 --> 00:06:39,312
It's number 3

128
00:06:39,312 --> 00:06:42,312
I see. Is there any movement?

129
00:06:42,312 --> 00:06:48,312
Hosomatcho is slow and 3 is loud

130
00:06:48,312 --> 00:06:50,312
It's like a technique

131
00:06:50,312 --> 00:06:52,312
It's like listening to the movement

132
00:06:52,312 --> 00:06:54,312
There is no movement

133
00:06:54,312 --> 00:06:55,312
There is no movement?

134
00:06:55,312 --> 00:06:57,312
Let's try it

135
00:06:57,312 --> 00:07:02,312
Ebichu's Hosomatcho 3

136
00:07:02,312 --> 00:07:04,312
Like this

137
00:07:04,312 --> 00:07:11,312
Ebichu's Hosomatcho 3 2 1

138
00:07:11,312 --> 00:07:13,312
Gari Gari Ramen Chugaku

139
00:07:13,312 --> 00:07:17,712
Thank you for watching!

140
00:07:18,712 --> 00:07:21,712
Now, everyone has their catchphrases

141
00:07:22,712 --> 00:07:26,712
Who will Mayama choose?

142
00:07:27,712 --> 00:07:30,712
Muscle, muscular, thin, and muscular

143
00:07:30,712 --> 00:07:33,712
3,2,1

144
00:07:33,712 --> 00:07:37,712
Mayama

145
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:40,240
It's so cool

146
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:42,240
I'm so happy

147
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:44,240
So you're going to do this next time

148
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:45,240
Yes

149
00:07:45,240 --> 00:07:47,240
Do we have to do this on such a big
stage?

150
00:07:47,240 --> 00:07:49,240
Yes, it's a big stage

151
00:07:49,240 --> 00:07:52,240
Why did you choose this place?

152
00:07:53,240 --> 00:07:56,240
Ebichu Tastasu's big news

153
00:07:56,240 --> 00:07:58,240
Next is

154
00:07:58,240 --> 00:08:00,240
Next news is

155
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:06,240
Nakayama's big news

156
00:08:08,840 --> 00:08:10,840
There is a Nakayama project

157
00:08:10,840 --> 00:08:13,840
Is there a Kobayashi project in a year?

158
00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:15,840
Yes, there is

159
00:08:16,840 --> 00:08:20,840
Following the Nakayama project, the
second member project in November

160
00:08:20,840 --> 00:08:23,840
Ebituutasu Kobayashi will be held

161
00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:29,840
He challenged to make a giant paper
airplane

162
00:08:32,984 --> 00:08:35,984
By the way, we've seen Nakayama and
Kobayashi so far.

163
00:08:35,984 --> 00:08:37,984
Is there anyone who wants to try next?

164
00:08:38,984 --> 00:08:40,984
I've never thought about it.

165
00:08:42,984 --> 00:08:43,984
Yasumoto, you?

166
00:08:43,984 --> 00:08:44,984
Me?

167
00:08:46,984 --> 00:08:47,984
Me?

168
00:08:47,984 --> 00:08:49,984
Origami?

169
00:08:49,984 --> 00:08:50,984
Origami?

170
00:08:50,984 --> 00:08:51,984
I've done it.

171
00:08:51,984 --> 00:08:52,984
Origami?

172
00:08:52,984 --> 00:08:53,984
I've done it.

173
00:08:53,984 --> 00:08:55,984
But Origami is really good.

174
00:08:55,984 --> 00:08:57,984
Yasumoto, you're good at Origami?

175
00:08:57,984 --> 00:09:02,984
Sometimes, you can make a dinosaur with
Origami.

176
00:09:02,984 --> 00:09:03,984
3D?

177
00:09:03,984 --> 00:09:04,984
What about you, Ayano?

178
00:09:04,984 --> 00:09:06,984
I can make a Pakupaku.

179
00:09:07,984 --> 00:09:08,984
Pakupaku?

180
00:09:08,984 --> 00:09:10,984
So, you want to make a Pakupaku?

181
00:09:10,984 --> 00:09:12,984
A giant Pakupaku.

182
00:09:12,984 --> 00:09:14,984
A giant series?

183
00:09:14,984 --> 00:09:15,984
It won't fly.

184
00:09:15,984 --> 00:09:17,984
You mean, you drop it from the roof?

185
00:09:19,984 --> 00:09:21,984
But it looks like it will fly.

186
00:09:21,984 --> 00:09:22,984
It won't fly.

187
00:09:22,984 --> 00:09:24,984
It won't fly.

188
00:09:24,984 --> 00:09:26,984
What's this?

189
00:09:26,984 --> 00:09:28,984
Ebichu Tastasu, the big news.

190
00:09:28,984 --> 00:09:31,696
Next.

191
00:09:32,696 --> 00:09:35,696
Shandong!

192
00:09:35,696 --> 00:09:39,696
Fashion competition, 3 consecutive wins.
Ebichu's fashion leader, Yasumoto.

193
00:09:42,696 --> 00:09:50,696
The first winner of the popular project,
Ebichu Fashion Coordinate Battle is the
Yasumoto-Kashiwagi pair.

194
00:09:50,696 --> 00:10:00,696
The second time, Yasumoto won.

195
00:10:02,340 --> 00:10:10,180
They headed to Kameido in Hiroshima to
visit で honestly, Yasumoto still won.

196
00:10:10,180 --> 00:10:14,460
And they ended theiracknowledged fashion
competition.

197
00:10:16,280 --> 00:10:21,280
I'm sure they'll talk to me about the
clothes I'm wearing.

198
00:10:21,280 --> 00:10:23,280
Like, it's nice.

199
00:10:23,280 --> 00:10:25,280
Are you sure?

200
00:10:25,280 --> 00:10:26,280
Who?

201
00:10:26,280 --> 00:10:27,280
I don't know.

202
00:10:27,280 --> 00:10:28,280
Who said that?

203
00:10:28,280 --> 00:10:29,280
You can say anything.

204
00:10:29,280 --> 00:10:31,280
Yasumoto-chan, who told you that?

205
00:10:31,280 --> 00:10:35,280
Today, I thought the fluffy muffler
looked warm.

206
00:10:35,280 --> 00:10:37,280
No, it looked warm.

207
00:10:37,280 --> 00:10:38,280
It looked cool.

208
00:10:38,280 --> 00:10:40,280
It wasn't fashionable.

209
00:10:40,280 --> 00:10:47,280
The fashion leader's feelings are not
well conveyed, so we'll show you
Yasumoto's latest fashion.

210
00:10:50,024 --> 00:10:55,024
After this, we'll show you the fashion
leader's unique fashion.

211
00:10:56,024 --> 00:10:58,024
Black is not good.

212
00:11:02,024 --> 00:11:08,024
The fashion leader Yasumoto will show
you the latest fashion.

213
00:11:09,024 --> 00:11:11,024
First, this.

214
00:11:11,024 --> 00:11:13,024
Chidori-bo!

215
00:11:13,024 --> 00:11:14,928
Chidori-bo!

216
00:11:15,928 --> 00:11:18,928
I like matching the patterns.

217
00:11:18,928 --> 00:11:22,928
I like matching the patterns, so I made
it as a theme.

218
00:11:22,928 --> 00:11:23,928
You have a high sense.

219
00:11:23,928 --> 00:11:25,928
My student said, you have a high sense.

220
00:11:25,928 --> 00:11:27,928
A student without sense said that.

221
00:11:28,928 --> 00:11:29,928
I see.

222
00:11:29,928 --> 00:11:31,928
Let's continue.

223
00:11:31,928 --> 00:11:32,928
Here.

224
00:11:34,928 --> 00:11:35,928
Who is this?

225
00:11:35,928 --> 00:11:36,928
Who is this?

226
00:11:36,928 --> 00:11:40,928
I took this after taking a bath, so I
thought I'd hide my face with a hat.

227
00:11:40,928 --> 00:11:41,928
No, no, no.

228
00:11:41,928 --> 00:11:43,928
It's a coordination that started with a
hat.

229
00:11:43,928 --> 00:11:44,928
It started with a hat.

230
00:11:44,928 --> 00:11:46,928
It's udon.

231
00:11:46,928 --> 00:11:47,928
It's true. It's udon.

232
00:11:47,928 --> 00:11:49,928
It's a pattern of udon.

233
00:11:49,928 --> 00:11:51,928
My favorite is the fluffy one.

234
00:11:51,928 --> 00:11:53,928
It's like deep-fried tofu.

235
00:11:53,928 --> 00:11:54,928
It's like deep-fried tofu.

236
00:11:54,928 --> 00:11:55,928
It's like Kitsune.

237
00:11:55,928 --> 00:11:56,928
It's like Kitsune.

238
00:11:57,928 --> 00:11:58,928
This is a wall, right?

239
00:11:58,928 --> 00:12:00,928
It's a pattern of a wall.

240
00:12:00,928 --> 00:12:01,928
It's a sticker.

241
00:12:02,928 --> 00:12:04,928
It's almost the same as udon.

242
00:12:04,928 --> 00:12:06,928
It's integrated with the wall.

243
00:12:06,928 --> 00:12:09,928
It's great that you can match the
fashion with the wall.

244
00:12:09,928 --> 00:12:10,928
Where are you praising?

245
00:12:10,928 --> 00:12:11,928
Thank you.

246
00:12:11,928 --> 00:12:13,928
You're praising the wall and the
pattern.

247
00:12:13,928 --> 00:12:14,928
Thank you.

248
00:12:14,928 --> 00:12:15,928
As expected of a disciple.

249
00:12:15,928 --> 00:12:16,928
Let's go to the last one.

250
00:12:17,928 --> 00:12:18,928
Here.

251
00:12:20,928 --> 00:12:21,928
It's scary.

252
00:12:21,928 --> 00:12:22,928
Is this Yasumoto?

253
00:12:22,928 --> 00:12:23,928
It's Yasumoto.

254
00:12:23,928 --> 00:12:25,928
Is this a straight bangs?

255
00:12:25,928 --> 00:12:27,928
Yes, I'm wearing straight bangs.

256
00:12:27,928 --> 00:12:28,928
I see.

257
00:12:28,928 --> 00:12:31,928
This is a trendy black outfit.

258
00:12:32,928 --> 00:12:33,928
Is it a trend?

259
00:12:33,928 --> 00:12:34,928
Yes, black.

260
00:12:34,928 --> 00:12:35,928
Matsuno is bitter.

261
00:12:35,928 --> 00:12:36,928
It's amazing.

262
00:12:36,928 --> 00:12:38,928
Matsuno, is that so?

263
00:12:38,928 --> 00:12:40,928
Is it a trendy black outfit?

264
00:12:40,928 --> 00:12:42,928
You're involved in this.

265
00:12:43,928 --> 00:12:45,928
I want to get out of here.

266
00:12:45,928 --> 00:12:46,928
It's a black outfit.

267
00:12:46,928 --> 00:12:50,928
I can't finish it with just a trendy
style.

268
00:12:50,928 --> 00:12:52,928
I like patterns.

269
00:12:52,928 --> 00:12:53,928
You often say that.

270
00:12:53,928 --> 00:12:55,928
I like patterns.

271
00:12:55,928 --> 00:12:58,928
I chose a muffler pattern around my
neck.

272
00:12:59,928 --> 00:13:01,928
By the way, how do you feel?

273
00:13:01,928 --> 00:13:02,928
How do you feel?

274
00:13:03,928 --> 00:13:04,928
Mayama, how do you feel?

275
00:13:04,928 --> 00:13:06,928
It's a strange atmosphere.

276
00:13:07,928 --> 00:13:08,928
Did you notice?

277
00:13:08,928 --> 00:13:09,928
What should I do?

278
00:13:09,928 --> 00:13:11,928
I'm upset.

279
00:13:11,928 --> 00:13:12,928
Are you upset?

280
00:13:13,928 --> 00:13:15,928
Chijiwa was here.

281
00:13:15,928 --> 00:13:18,928
Chijiwa gave me these three evaluations.

282
00:13:18,928 --> 00:13:19,928
Thank you.

283
00:13:19,928 --> 00:13:20,928
Let's go.

284
00:13:21,928 --> 00:13:24,928
The evaluation of the members was not
good.

285
00:13:24,928 --> 00:13:25,928
Yasumoto's fashion.

286
00:13:25,928 --> 00:13:30,272
How did the professional see it?

287
00:13:31,272 --> 00:13:33,272
Let's look at the comments one by one

288
00:13:33,272 --> 00:13:36,272
First, the fashion is unique with the
different patterns

289
00:13:36,272 --> 00:13:39,272
The trend color terracotta is a fashion
trend

290
00:13:39,272 --> 00:13:42,272
The retro glasses are cute

291
00:13:42,272 --> 00:13:44,272
This fashion is amazing

292
00:13:45,272 --> 00:13:47,272
What is terracotta?

293
00:13:47,272 --> 00:13:48,272
I don't know

294
00:13:48,272 --> 00:13:49,272
You don't know?

295
00:13:49,272 --> 00:13:51,272
That's amazing!

296
00:13:51,272 --> 00:13:56,272
What is this udon-style clothing?

297
00:13:57,560 --> 00:14:01,560
I collaborated with the wall paper
pattern and the T-shirt pattern and got
200,000 yen!

298
00:14:02,560 --> 00:14:03,560
Wow!

299
00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:05,560
That's amazing!

300
00:14:05,560 --> 00:14:06,560
Really?

301
00:14:07,560 --> 00:14:09,560
You're praising me too much, aren't you?

302
00:14:09,560 --> 00:14:12,560
Are you a disciple of Chijiwa-san?

303
00:14:13,560 --> 00:14:14,560
That's strange, isn't it?

304
00:14:15,560 --> 00:14:18,560
So far, it's been a high-rated video
without any complaints.

305
00:14:18,560 --> 00:14:23,056
Next time, the black outfit of Nigawarai
in Matsu.

306
00:14:24,056 --> 00:14:26,056
This year's trend is the color of the
clothes.

307
00:14:27,056 --> 00:14:29,056
On the other hand, the one-color outfit
is the trend.

308
00:14:30,056 --> 00:14:33,056
The outfit is a combination of a coat
and a cardigan.

309
00:14:34,056 --> 00:14:35,056
The size is a little big.

310
00:14:36,056 --> 00:14:37,056
It's a big outfit for an adult.

311
00:14:37,056 --> 00:14:41,408
It's a scary outfit.

312
00:14:42,408 --> 00:14:44,408
Yasumoto-san, what do you think?

313
00:14:44,408 --> 00:14:47,408
I heard that it's a scary outfit.

314
00:14:47,408 --> 00:14:56,408
I don't know how to say it, but
Yasumoto's fashion is praised in a
strange way.

315
00:14:56,408 --> 00:14:58,408
I see. You're not used to being praised.

316
00:15:01,408 --> 00:15:03,408
Ebichu Tastasu's big news.

317
00:15:03,408 --> 00:15:06,576
Next.

318
00:15:07,576 --> 00:15:08,576
What is it?

319
00:15:10,576 --> 00:15:13,576
Hinata's Hiding the Secret of the Snow-
Covered Oogiri

320
00:15:16,576 --> 00:15:19,576
Oogiri, a popular segment in the Mini
Corner Festival

321
00:15:20,576 --> 00:15:23,576
Here, Kashiwagi showed her hidden talent

322
00:15:24,576 --> 00:15:26,576
Both of them have love, right?

323
00:15:27,576 --> 00:15:29,576
The topic is, is it a person in a photo?

324
00:15:30,576 --> 00:15:33,576
The answer that Kashiwagi gave to Oogiri
is...

325
00:15:33,576 --> 00:15:34,576
Yes!

326
00:15:36,328 --> 00:15:39,328
I think I'm the only gorilla in this
village.

327
00:15:41,328 --> 00:15:42,328
Kashiwagi, you got 2 points!

328
00:15:43,328 --> 00:15:45,328
You noticed after I got this big?

329
00:15:46,328 --> 00:15:48,328
Special project!

330
00:15:48,328 --> 00:15:50,328
Special project!

331
00:15:50,328 --> 00:15:56,864
Special project! Kashiwagi vs. Ebichu
Tastasu vs. Oogiri Challenge!

332
00:15:57,864 --> 00:15:59,864
This is not the top!

333
00:16:01,864 --> 00:16:04,864
Let's take a look at this photo

334
00:16:09,864 --> 00:16:10,864
What is this?

335
00:16:13,864 --> 00:16:16,864
It's raining. I thought I'd bring an
umbrella but it's just a green onion

336
00:16:19,864 --> 00:16:20,864
I'm not going to quit

337
00:16:20,864 --> 00:16:24,864
I'm not going to quit. I'm going to do
Kashiwagi

338
00:16:25,536 --> 00:16:28,192
Hi baby, I'm not scared.

339
00:16:29,192 --> 00:16:31,192
Are you scared?

340
00:16:31,192 --> 00:16:33,192
I'm definitely scared.

341
00:16:33,192 --> 00:16:35,192
That's good.

342
00:16:35,192 --> 00:16:37,192
Let's stop.

343
00:16:37,192 --> 00:16:40,192
I noticed something.

344
00:16:40,192 --> 00:16:42,192
I noticed something.

345
00:16:42,192 --> 00:16:46,192
In this program, there is no one who is
good at playing the game.

346
00:16:50,192 --> 00:16:55,192
Let's take a break from the important
news and move on to the next segment.

347
00:16:55,192 --> 00:17:04,192
I asked the people who watch TASTASU
often to tell me their favorite scenes.

348
00:17:04,192 --> 00:17:12,192
Who are the people who watch this
program?

349
00:17:13,704 --> 00:17:19,704
Kobayashi Grandpa and Yasumoto Papa's
Pick! Ebichu Tatsusatsu!

350
00:17:21,704 --> 00:17:24,704
Kobayashi Grandpa is watching this
program?

351
00:17:24,704 --> 00:17:26,704
He is always watching this program

352
00:17:26,704 --> 00:17:31,704
He called me and said he was glad

353
00:17:32,704 --> 00:17:38,704
Kobayashi Grandpa and Yasumoto Papa are
watching this program every time

354
00:17:38,704 --> 00:17:42,704
They chose the best scene of this year

355
00:17:42,704 --> 00:17:49,808
Kobayashi Grandpa's Pick! Ebichu
Tatsutatsu!

356
00:17:50,808 --> 00:17:52,808
Kobayashi's Birthday Special!

357
00:17:54,808 --> 00:17:56,808
What's with this grandpa?

358
00:17:57,808 --> 00:17:59,808
In the end, it's just a grandchild.

359
00:18:00,808 --> 00:18:02,808
That's the result of all the things
we've done.

360
00:18:02,808 --> 00:18:04,808
It just happened.

361
00:18:04,808 --> 00:18:07,808
It's not like it's a special because we
have a grandchild.

362
00:18:07,808 --> 00:18:17,808
Kobayashi's Grandpa's Pick!

363
00:18:18,048 --> 00:18:22,048
The family members sang the song,

364
00:18:22,048 --> 00:18:24,048
and the audience was excited.

365
00:18:24,048 --> 00:18:27,048
I think it was a very harmonious
performance.

366
00:18:27,048 --> 00:18:28,048
I'm so embarrassed.

367
00:18:28,048 --> 00:18:29,048
That's what it is.

368
00:18:30,048 --> 00:18:31,048
I'm so embarrassed.

369
00:18:31,048 --> 00:18:32,048
Grandpa said,

370
00:18:32,048 --> 00:18:34,048
Absolute Anarchy!

371
00:18:36,048 --> 00:18:37,048
Grandpa doesn't say that.

372
00:18:38,048 --> 00:18:40,048
He doesn't say Absolute or Anarchy.

373
00:18:41,048 --> 00:18:42,048
Next,

374
00:18:42,048 --> 00:18:47,048
Yasumoto Papa's Pick! Tastasu's Famous
Scene

375
00:18:48,344 --> 00:18:49,344
The chosen one is...

376
00:18:49,344 --> 00:18:52,344
Tastasu's Pick! Tastasu's Pick!
Tastasu's Pick!

377
00:18:54,344 --> 00:18:55,344
According to Yasumoto Papa,

378
00:18:55,344 --> 00:18:58,344
It was natural for TV to see Aya-chan
asking the clerk,

379
00:18:58,344 --> 00:19:02,344
What do you recommend about this shop?

380
00:19:02,344 --> 00:19:04,344
But from Aya-chan's perspective,

381
00:19:04,344 --> 00:19:05,344
It was a surprising action.

382
00:19:05,344 --> 00:19:10,344
Actually, Aya-chan is not the type of
person who can ask the clerk anything.

383
00:19:10,344 --> 00:19:12,344
That's what it means.

384
00:19:13,344 --> 00:19:17,344
This is the scene where Yasumoto asked
the clerk for a recommendation.

385
00:19:18,344 --> 00:19:19,344
Did you choose?

386
00:19:19,344 --> 00:19:20,344
I chose!

387
00:19:20,344 --> 00:19:23,344
Excuse me, but do you have any
recommendations for this shop?

388
00:19:23,344 --> 00:19:25,344
Like, what do you recommend?

389
00:19:25,344 --> 00:19:27,344
I'm sure the clerk was like,

390
00:19:27,344 --> 00:19:28,344
Eh? Aya-chan?

391
00:19:29,344 --> 00:19:30,344
I don't know!

392
00:19:30,344 --> 00:19:32,344
I don't know Aya-chan usually.

393
00:19:33,344 --> 00:19:37,344
But usually, you definitely ask your
parents, right?

394
00:19:37,344 --> 00:19:39,344
I usually ask them to whisper in my ear.

395
00:19:39,344 --> 00:19:40,344
You're a princess!

396
00:19:41,344 --> 00:19:43,344
What's the name of the person?

397
00:19:46,344 --> 00:19:48,344
University of Arts and Letters News

398
00:19:49,344 --> 00:19:52,344
The first draft meeting in the history
of Ebichu.

399
00:19:53,344 --> 00:19:56,344
The first unit in history has been born.

400
00:19:57,344 --> 00:19:58,344
So, tonight,

401
00:19:58,344 --> 00:20:02,344
We're finally going to show you the
recording.

402
00:20:02,344 --> 00:20:05,344
And we're going to announce the title of
the song.

403
00:20:05,344 --> 00:20:09,344
You might only be able to hear one
phrase.

404
00:20:10,344 --> 00:20:14,344
Let's go straight to the studio and
shoot the producer Ogata.

405
00:20:15,344 --> 00:20:18,344
The theme of the song was Isoginchaku.

406
00:20:19,344 --> 00:20:23,344
Usually, when Isoginchaku and other fish
are in contact with each other,

407
00:20:23,344 --> 00:20:26,344
It's said that it's poisoned.

408
00:20:26,344 --> 00:20:28,344
But I'm fine with just bear meat.

409
00:20:28,344 --> 00:20:30,344
I'm going to pay a little attention to
that.

410
00:20:30,344 --> 00:20:35,344
I'm going to make a love song between
bear meat and Isoginchaku.

411
00:20:36,344 --> 00:20:40,344
I don't think you've ever imagined what
it's like.

412
00:20:40,344 --> 00:20:46,344
I think it's enough if you keep in mind
that Isoginchaku and fun are in your
head.

413
00:20:48,344 --> 00:20:51,344
Even if it's the first time you hear it,
you'll get really excited.

414
00:20:51,344 --> 00:20:54,344
I'm getting excited.

415
00:20:54,344 --> 00:21:00,344
Let's get Isoginchaku naturally and
dance in the venue.

416
00:21:01,344 --> 00:21:05,344
I hope you can enjoy it with your
family.

417
00:21:05,344 --> 00:21:13,344
There's a rumor that there's a high-
pitched response.

418
00:21:13,344 --> 00:21:15,344
Please look forward to it.

419
00:21:15,344 --> 00:21:18,344
Let's sing together.

420
00:21:18,344 --> 00:21:26,344
The title of the song is...

421
00:21:26,344 --> 00:21:29,344
Tamageta Koi no El Niño

422
00:21:29,344 --> 00:21:32,344
Tamageta Koi no El Niño

423
00:21:39,344 --> 00:21:43,344
Next, the unit produced by Tenkomori
Satsuki.

424
00:21:43,344 --> 00:21:47,344
The theme of the song was bear meat.

425
00:21:48,344 --> 00:21:57,344
I'm going to show you a song that will
make the whole venue a bear meat crowd.

426
00:21:57,344 --> 00:22:00,344
Please look forward to it.

427
00:22:00,344 --> 00:22:05,344
It's a new song in many ways.

428
00:22:05,344 --> 00:22:07,344
I think it's fun.

429
00:22:07,344 --> 00:22:11,344
Please play the bad bear meat part.

430
00:22:11,344 --> 00:22:13,344
It's a story.

431
00:22:13,344 --> 00:22:16,344
I'm looking forward to it.

432
00:22:16,344 --> 00:22:19,344
It's a bad bear meat.

433
00:22:20,344 --> 00:22:27,344
The title of the song is...

434
00:22:27,344 --> 00:22:30,344
Shintairiku

435
00:22:30,344 --> 00:22:41,344
Shintairiku

436
00:22:42,344 --> 00:22:46,344
Next, the unit produced by Takuta.

437
00:22:47,344 --> 00:22:50,344
The theme of the song was crab.

438
00:22:51,344 --> 00:22:55,344
Why do you have a crab on a holy night?

439
00:22:55,344 --> 00:23:00,344
I hope you don't get fooled by the crab.

440
00:23:00,344 --> 00:23:04,344
I hope you enjoy it.

441
00:23:04,344 --> 00:23:09,344
I think the truth of why it's a crab
will be revealed.

442
00:23:09,344 --> 00:23:13,344
I hope you enjoy it.

443
00:23:13,344 --> 00:23:17,344
Takuta, Tokyo 03, who mixed crab and
Christmas.

444
00:23:18,344 --> 00:23:22,344
Crab and Christmas.

445
00:23:22,344 --> 00:23:25,344
What's in the way?

446
00:23:27,344 --> 00:23:30,344
The title of the song is...

447
00:23:30,344 --> 00:23:33,344
Dinner Christmas

448
00:23:33,344 --> 00:23:35,920
Only one phrase.

449
00:23:37,816 --> 00:23:39,816
The unit name has been decided.

450
00:23:40,816 --> 00:23:42,816
First, the unit that Ogata Kaiki went to
is...

451
00:23:43,816 --> 00:23:45,816
Heisei Isokin Trio.

452
00:23:46,816 --> 00:23:49,816
This is a gathering of geniuses.

453
00:23:50,816 --> 00:23:52,816
Their talent is exploding.

454
00:23:53,816 --> 00:23:55,816
Please look forward to it.

455
00:23:57,816 --> 00:23:59,816
The unit that Satsuki and Tenkomori went
to is...

456
00:24:00,816 --> 00:24:01,816
Puku Puku.

457
00:24:02,816 --> 00:24:04,816
The unit that I, Satsuki, and Tenkomori
went to is...

458
00:24:04,816 --> 00:24:06,816
Puku Puku.

459
00:24:09,160 --> 00:24:12,160
It's a song that makes you feel like
you're being attacked by a bear.

460
00:24:12,160 --> 00:24:14,160
I hope you enjoy it.

461
00:24:17,544 --> 00:24:20,544
And the unit that Kakuta, the Tokyo 03,
chose is...

462
00:24:20,544 --> 00:24:22,544
Sankaku Kanita-san.

463
00:24:23,544 --> 00:24:25,544
Please enjoy the live!

The Ebichu Tastas News Grand Prix is
finally decided.

471
00:24:48,544 --> 00:24:51,544
That's no good. No good. No good.

472
00:24:51,544 --> 00:24:55,088
What kind of news is it?

473
00:24:55,088 --> 00:25:01,088

I can't do it!

475

Why are you sitting there?
