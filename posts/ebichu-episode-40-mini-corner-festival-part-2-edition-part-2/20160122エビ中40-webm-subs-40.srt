1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,580
The members are divided into three teams
and each challenge a completely
different project.

2
00:00:04,580 --> 00:00:07,680
In the last week's broadcast, what is
the routine?

3
00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:12,000
Teens who wear boot socks.

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:18,000
The new interpretation of the routine
was born in the self-talk of Kobayashi
Yasumoto.

5
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,340
And this week,

6
00:00:20,340 --> 00:00:22,000
Men!

7
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:23,620
With a shrimp-chewing cut,

8
00:00:23,620 --> 00:00:25,000
Don't go over there.

9
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:00,000
The members are

10
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Let loose.

11
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:13,000
Apparently a

12
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:17,960
A new interpretation of the routine was
born in the self-talk of the local
Kobayashi

13
00:00:17,960 --> 00:00:19,960
And this week

14
00:00:19,960 --> 00:00:21,960
No, no

15
00:00:21,960 --> 00:00:23,960
With shrimp chou

16
00:00:23,960 --> 00:00:24,960
Don't go there

17
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:27,960
What will happen to the members?

18
00:00:27,960 --> 00:00:31,960
In addition, the second half of the
Mayama Ayai walk

19
00:00:31,960 --> 00:00:33,960
Looks delicious

20
00:00:33,960 --> 00:00:35,960
What?

21
00:00:35,960 --> 00:00:37,960
Full of shopping street foods

22
00:00:37,960 --> 00:00:43,960
This week, the shrimp chou tastas start

23
00:01:08,920 --> 00:01:10,920
The second half is four

24
00:01:10,920 --> 00:01:16,920
High school, high school, high school,
high school

25
00:01:16,920 --> 00:01:20,920
Never ending school

26
00:01:20,920 --> 00:01:26,920
Never ending school

27
00:01:26,920 --> 00:01:30,920
Add various things to private shrimp
chou school

28
00:01:30,920 --> 00:01:34,920
Shrimp chou tastas

29
00:01:34,920 --> 00:01:40,920
This program is provided by the sponsor
you see

30
00:01:40,920 --> 00:01:42,920
This is also delicious

31
00:01:42,920 --> 00:01:46,920
Let's eat the shrimp chou

32
00:01:50,920 --> 00:01:52,920
Shrimp chou mini-corner festival

33
00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:54,920
First of all

34
00:01:54,920 --> 00:01:56,920
Mayama Rikato

35
00:01:56,920 --> 00:02:00,920
Hirata Aika's Mayama Ayai walk

36
00:02:00,920 --> 00:02:06,920
This program fully conveys the charm of
Yanaka Ginza shopping street

37
00:02:06,920 --> 00:02:08,920
Wow

38
00:02:08,920 --> 00:02:12,920
What is this?

39
00:02:12,920 --> 00:02:14,920
Looks delicious

40
00:02:14,920 --> 00:02:20,920
Eat all the shopping street foods from
one side

41
00:02:20,920 --> 00:02:24,920
And the takiue who should be together

42
00:02:24,920 --> 00:02:26,920
I'll sell this

43
00:02:26,920 --> 00:02:30,920
While walking, he sells the omen he
bought on his own

44
00:02:30,920 --> 00:02:32,920
However

45
00:02:32,920 --> 00:02:34,920
1000 yen

46
00:02:34,920 --> 00:02:36,920
What?

47
00:02:36,920 --> 00:02:42,920
The price of the omen he bought for
20,000 yen is only 1000 yen

48
00:02:42,920 --> 00:02:44,920
Yanaka Ginza is delicious

49
00:02:44,920 --> 00:02:48,920
What will happen after this?

50
00:02:48,920 --> 00:02:50,920
The second half starts

51
00:02:50,920 --> 00:02:56,920
Two people who are eager to eat shopping
street foods from the end

52
00:02:56,920 --> 00:03:00,920
What came into their eyes?

53
00:03:00,920 --> 00:03:02,920
What?

54
00:03:02,920 --> 00:03:04,920
Hey

55
00:03:04,920 --> 00:03:06,920
Are you doing it?

56
00:03:06,920 --> 00:03:08,920
What?

57
00:03:08,920 --> 00:03:10,920
What is this?

58
00:03:10,920 --> 00:03:12,920
What do you have in your hand?

59
00:03:12,920 --> 00:03:14,920
What?

60
00:03:14,920 --> 00:03:18,920
The omen he should have sold is in his
hand

61
00:03:18,920 --> 00:03:20,920
Right?

62
00:03:20,920 --> 00:03:24,920
Why do you have this?

63
00:03:24,920 --> 00:03:26,920
I want you to know

64
00:03:26,920 --> 00:03:30,920
The omen he bought for 20,000 yen

65
00:03:30,920 --> 00:03:36,920
The price of the omen was 1100 yen

66
00:03:36,920 --> 00:03:39,920
It's a little bit half

67
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:41,920
That's right

68
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:44,920
Actually, when he was selling

69
00:03:44,920 --> 00:03:48,920
1000 yen

70
00:03:48,920 --> 00:03:52,920
Takiue was not convinced by the price of
1000 yen

71
00:03:52,920 --> 00:03:54,920
So

72
00:03:54,920 --> 00:03:58,920
Takiue has used this many times

73
00:03:58,920 --> 00:04:00,920
Please give me more than 1000 yen

74
00:04:00,920 --> 00:04:06,920
He added the value of the top star
Takiue

75
00:04:06,920 --> 00:04:08,920
I will give you 10%

76
00:04:08,920 --> 00:04:12,920
I will buy it for 1100 yen

77
00:04:12,920 --> 00:04:16,920
He made 100 yen with the value of the
top star

78
00:04:16,920 --> 00:04:18,920
But

79
00:04:18,920 --> 00:04:22,920
I can't let go of this cute girl

80
00:04:22,920 --> 00:04:24,920
I can't let go of her

81
00:04:24,920 --> 00:04:30,920
I can't let go of her

82
00:04:30,920 --> 00:04:35,920
Takiue is in the omen

83
00:04:35,920 --> 00:04:39,920
What are they going to do next?

84
00:04:39,920 --> 00:04:43,920
It looks delicious

85
00:04:43,920 --> 00:04:45,920
It looks delicious

86
00:04:45,920 --> 00:04:48,920
Is this a donut?

87
00:04:48,920 --> 00:04:52,920
He is interested in food

88
00:04:52,920 --> 00:04:54,920
I can't eat the tail

89
00:04:54,920 --> 00:04:56,920
It's not bad

90
00:04:56,920 --> 00:04:58,920
I can't eat the tail

91
00:04:58,920 --> 00:05:03,920
Yanaka Ginza shopping street is famous
for cats

92
00:05:03,920 --> 00:05:10,920
Yanaka Ginza sells donuts with a cat
tail motif

93
00:05:10,920 --> 00:05:12,920
I want to eat

94
00:05:12,920 --> 00:05:14,920
You ate a lot

95
00:05:14,920 --> 00:05:16,920
I ate a lot, but if I see this

96
00:05:16,920 --> 00:05:20,920
Please like the four colors

97
00:05:20,920 --> 00:05:22,920
Which one is recommended?

98
00:05:22,920 --> 00:05:24,920
Pumpkin rice

99
00:05:24,920 --> 00:05:26,920
Pumpkin

100
00:05:26,920 --> 00:05:30,920
Pumpkin is delicious

101
00:05:30,920 --> 00:05:34,920
Mayama is interested in pumpkin

102
00:05:34,920 --> 00:05:36,920
What is Mayama?

103
00:05:36,920 --> 00:05:38,920
Really?

104
00:05:38,920 --> 00:05:41,920
Do you want to make it a marigold?

105
00:05:41,920 --> 00:05:43,920
The hero recommends pumpkin

106
00:05:43,920 --> 00:05:45,920
Don't ignore it

107
00:05:45,920 --> 00:05:47,920
I will make it a pumpkin

108
00:05:47,920 --> 00:05:51,920
Mayama, you have a place to go

109
00:05:51,920 --> 00:05:54,920
Let's eat

110
00:05:54,920 --> 00:05:56,920
It's warm

111
00:05:56,920 --> 00:06:00,920
I will eat

112
00:06:00,920 --> 00:06:04,920
What is inside?

113
00:06:04,920 --> 00:06:06,920
It's delicious

114
00:06:06,920 --> 00:06:09,920
The usual eating insert

115
00:06:09,920 --> 00:06:13,920
Eating insert is strange

116
00:06:13,920 --> 00:06:15,920
It's kind

117
00:06:15,920 --> 00:06:17,920
The dough is kind

118
00:06:17,920 --> 00:06:21,920
The outside is crispy and the inside is
fluffy

119
00:06:21,920 --> 00:06:26,920
If this is the insert, I will be excited

120
00:06:26,920 --> 00:06:29,920
What is the insert?

121
00:06:29,920 --> 00:06:33,920
I want to eat delicious food

122
00:06:33,920 --> 00:06:38,920
If it's Hinata, I will definitely know
it's chocolate

123
00:06:38,920 --> 00:06:40,920
If it's Mirei, it's this

124
00:06:40,920 --> 00:06:43,920
Mirei is definitely a maiden

125
00:06:43,920 --> 00:06:46,920
Ayu is a camel

126
00:06:46,920 --> 00:06:52,920
There are many members

127
00:06:52,920 --> 00:06:56,920
Members are coming out of the food

128
00:06:56,920 --> 00:07:00,920
Is it a feast during the day?

129
00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:04,920
They still have no appetite

130
00:07:04,920 --> 00:07:06,920
Hello, father

131
00:07:06,920 --> 00:07:08,920
Is it delicious?

132
00:07:08,920 --> 00:07:10,920
It's delicious

133
00:07:10,920 --> 00:07:12,920
Thank you

134
00:07:12,920 --> 00:07:14,920
It's delicious

135
00:07:14,920 --> 00:07:17,920
It's good to eat like this

136
00:07:17,920 --> 00:07:21,920
I want to come here in private

137
00:07:21,920 --> 00:07:24,920
Cute

138
00:07:24,920 --> 00:07:26,920
It's Shin-chan

139
00:07:26,920 --> 00:07:31,920
They are interested in other than food

140
00:07:31,920 --> 00:07:33,920
Cat

141
00:07:33,920 --> 00:07:36,920
There are only cats

142
00:07:36,920 --> 00:07:38,920
Amazing

143
00:07:38,920 --> 00:07:41,920
I tried to eat

144
00:07:41,920 --> 00:07:44,920
This is strange

145
00:07:44,920 --> 00:07:46,920
It's a strange thing

146
00:07:46,920 --> 00:07:48,920
It's not a cat

147
00:07:48,920 --> 00:07:52,920
They found a store that is full of cat
goods

148
00:07:52,920 --> 00:07:56,920
What is going on inside the store?

149
00:07:56,920 --> 00:07:59,920
There are many black cats

150
00:07:59,920 --> 00:08:02,920
Excuse me

151
00:08:02,920 --> 00:08:06,920
They have to move fast

152
00:08:06,920 --> 00:08:09,920
Hello

153
00:08:09,920 --> 00:08:11,920
Amazing

154
00:08:11,920 --> 00:08:13,920
Is this Shin-chan?

155
00:08:13,920 --> 00:08:15,920
Shin-chan

156
00:08:15,920 --> 00:08:18,920
The store is full of black cats

157
00:08:18,920 --> 00:08:20,920
How old are you?

158
00:08:20,920 --> 00:08:21,920
6 years old

159
00:08:21,920 --> 00:08:22,920
I'm also Shin-chan

160
00:08:22,920 --> 00:08:24,920
Really?

161
00:08:24,920 --> 00:08:28,920
It's a cat

162
00:08:28,920 --> 00:08:30,920
Shin-chan, hello

163
00:08:30,920 --> 00:08:32,920
I'm scared

164
00:08:32,920 --> 00:08:35,920
You are scared

165
00:08:35,920 --> 00:08:39,920
I'm sorry

166
00:08:39,920 --> 00:08:45,920
I have something to decorate this mask

167
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:49,920
It's a problem to be told like that

168
00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:53,920
I will wear this

169
00:08:53,920 --> 00:08:55,920
Cat ears that look good on the mask

170
00:08:55,920 --> 00:08:57,920
Can you wear it?

171
00:08:57,920 --> 00:08:59,920
I think it's a problem

172
00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:01,920
You can wear it

173
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:05,920
I will wear it

174
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:07,920
Shin-chan is saying

175
00:09:07,920 --> 00:09:09,920
You wear it

176
00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:12,920
I didn't say

177
00:09:12,920 --> 00:09:14,920
I didn't say

178
00:09:14,920 --> 00:09:16,920
OK

179
00:09:16,920 --> 00:09:19,920
Cat ears that look good on the mask

180
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:21,920
Cat ears

181
00:09:21,920 --> 00:09:23,920
It's a shrimp ball

182
00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:25,920
It doesn't matter

183
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:28,920
Shin-chan, look

184
00:09:28,920 --> 00:09:34,920
Let's leave the cat Shin-chan alone

185
00:09:34,920 --> 00:09:36,920
Thank you

186
00:09:36,920 --> 00:09:38,920
Shin-chan, bye

187
00:09:38,920 --> 00:09:41,920
You got a good one

188
00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:43,920
I'm glad

189
00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:48,920
Mayama-san found something again

190
00:09:48,920 --> 00:09:50,920
What is this?

191
00:09:50,920 --> 00:09:52,920
What is this?

192
00:09:52,920 --> 00:09:56,920
Mayama-san found a shop

193
00:09:56,920 --> 00:09:58,920
This is Zakro

194
00:09:58,920 --> 00:10:04,920
It's a restaurant where you can taste
the local food of Iran, Turkey and
Uzbekistan

195
00:10:04,920 --> 00:10:06,920
I think it's good

196
00:10:06,920 --> 00:10:08,920
Hello

197
00:10:08,920 --> 00:10:10,920
Cute

198
00:10:10,920 --> 00:10:14,920
You two go to the shop next to that man

199
00:10:14,920 --> 00:10:17,920
Why are you going there?

200
00:10:17,920 --> 00:10:20,920
That person is used to the TV

201
00:10:20,920 --> 00:10:22,920
Did you say something?

202
00:10:22,920 --> 00:10:24,920
I didn't say anything

203
00:10:24,920 --> 00:10:27,920
Let's go inside the shop

204
00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:30,920
Come

205
00:10:30,920 --> 00:10:36,920
There are colorful torco lamps on the
ceiling

206
00:10:36,920 --> 00:10:38,920
Beautiful

207
00:10:38,920 --> 00:10:40,920
Wait, there is a camel

208
00:10:40,920 --> 00:10:42,920
Camel

209
00:10:42,920 --> 00:10:45,920
There is a big camel doll in the shop

210
00:10:45,920 --> 00:10:47,920
What is this?

211
00:10:47,920 --> 00:10:49,920
Come in

212
00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:54,920
We have to leave this to the flow

213
00:10:54,920 --> 00:10:57,920
You are getting angry all of a sudden

214
00:10:57,920 --> 00:10:59,920
Are you OK?

215
00:10:59,920 --> 00:11:01,920
Mayama

216
00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:09,920
This shop is doing free rental of
traditional costumes to enjoy local food
more

217
00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:11,920
Wait

218
00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:14,920
It's delicious

219
00:11:14,920 --> 00:11:16,920
I don't feel uncomfortable

220
00:11:16,920 --> 00:11:19,920
It's good

221
00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:23,920
Mayama-san is in a hurry

222
00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:29,920
Let's eat the recommended food before we
forget that this is a restaurant

223
00:11:29,920 --> 00:11:31,920
It's called Gyozlama

224
00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:33,920
Gyozlama?

225
00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:39,920
It's made by three grandmothers in the
market

226
00:11:39,920 --> 00:11:43,920
The taste of the Turkish home food

227
00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:45,920
What is this?

228
00:11:45,920 --> 00:11:47,920
It's delicious

229
00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:50,920
It's like pizza

230
00:11:50,920 --> 00:11:53,920
I've never seen this before

231
00:11:53,920 --> 00:11:55,920
It's like pizza

232
00:11:55,920 --> 00:11:58,920
How was the walk?

233
00:11:58,920 --> 00:12:04,920
It was fun to walk slowly

234
00:12:04,920 --> 00:12:06,920
It was a first experience

235
00:12:06,920 --> 00:12:08,920
It's different from the start

236
00:12:08,920 --> 00:12:11,920
I think everyone is young

237
00:12:11,920 --> 00:12:17,920
It was a shocking experience

238
00:12:17,920 --> 00:12:19,920
Next is Ebichu

239
00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:23,920
It's a project that tests the sense of
humor of the members

240
00:12:23,920 --> 00:12:25,920
Before that

241
00:12:25,920 --> 00:12:30,920
Ebichu Game Quest

242
00:12:30,920 --> 00:12:35,920
Ebichu game project is currently in
progress

243
00:12:35,920 --> 00:12:42,920
Ebichu songs are arranged in the game
and used as BGM

244
00:12:42,920 --> 00:12:46,920
So today we will reveal some of them

245
00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:51,920
Amazing

246
00:12:51,920 --> 00:12:53,920
Let's play

247
00:12:53,920 --> 00:12:55,920
Amazing

248
00:12:55,920 --> 00:12:57,920
The game is amazing

249
00:12:57,920 --> 00:13:02,920
The members have come up with various
ideas about the game

250
00:13:02,920 --> 00:13:08,920
This time they will think of the songs
they want to use in the game

251
00:13:08,920 --> 00:13:10,920
First is Mayama

252
00:13:10,920 --> 00:13:12,920
Esax

253
00:13:12,920 --> 00:13:14,920
Esax game

254
00:13:14,920 --> 00:13:16,920
Run more

255
00:13:16,920 --> 00:13:18,920
It's good to run more

256
00:13:18,920 --> 00:13:20,920
It's like playing more

257
00:13:20,920 --> 00:13:23,920
Next is Hoshina

258
00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:26,920
I'm a middle school student

259
00:13:26,920 --> 00:13:30,920
I'm doing this and that

260
00:13:30,920 --> 00:13:32,920
I'm doing this and that

261
00:13:32,920 --> 00:13:35,920
Next is Kobayashi

262
00:13:35,920 --> 00:13:36,920
Sting

263
00:13:36,920 --> 00:13:40,920
It's like a magic

264
00:13:40,920 --> 00:13:43,920
It's like a magic

265
00:13:43,920 --> 00:13:45,920
It's terrible

266
00:13:45,920 --> 00:13:47,920
It's like a magic

267
00:13:47,920 --> 00:13:50,920
It's like a magic

268
00:13:50,920 --> 00:13:52,920
It's like a magic

269
00:13:52,920 --> 00:13:55,920
The last one is Makayama

270
00:13:55,920 --> 00:13:58,920
I'm your manager

271
00:13:58,920 --> 00:14:01,920
Please open it

272
00:14:01,920 --> 00:14:03,920
It's not over yet

273
00:14:03,920 --> 00:14:05,920
I'm out of the mood

274
00:14:05,920 --> 00:14:08,920
I'm wearing school uniform

275
00:14:08,920 --> 00:14:11,920
So I don't look like a school girl

276
00:14:11,920 --> 00:14:14,920
The reason is reasonable

277
00:14:14,920 --> 00:14:16,920
How is this request?

278
00:14:16,920 --> 00:14:18,920
I hope you will have a good game

279
00:14:18,920 --> 00:14:20,920
Thank you

280
00:14:20,920 --> 00:14:25,920
Ebichu game project is still in progress

281
00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:28,920
I took a new sea fish

282
00:14:28,920 --> 00:14:33,920
After this, the legend of Matsu starts

283
00:14:33,920 --> 00:14:35,920
Mini corner festival

284
00:14:35,920 --> 00:15:04,920
Ebichu game

285
00:15:04,920 --> 00:15:20,920
Ebichu game

286
00:15:20,920 --> 00:15:24,920
Ebichu game started

287
00:15:24,920 --> 00:15:28,920
It's the end of the game

288
00:15:28,920 --> 00:15:35,920
Please introduce yourself

289
00:15:35,920 --> 00:15:38,920
I was told to wash my hands

290
00:15:38,920 --> 00:15:40,920
I washed my hands

291
00:15:40,920 --> 00:15:42,920
My hands became dry

292
00:15:42,920 --> 00:15:43,920
I'm Hoshinami Rei

293
00:15:43,920 --> 00:15:45,920
Thank you

294
00:15:45,920 --> 00:15:53,920
Recently, I was watching a magazine with
my mom

295
00:15:53,920 --> 00:15:56,920
My mom was too mobile

296
00:15:56,920 --> 00:16:02,920
I was surprised

297
00:16:02,920 --> 00:16:06,920
I'm worried about my mom's fun

298
00:16:06,920 --> 00:16:08,920
Please

299
00:16:08,920 --> 00:16:11,920
It's not a mobile screen

300
00:16:11,920 --> 00:16:14,920
I have a pet

301
00:16:14,920 --> 00:16:17,920
I'm not used to it

302
00:16:17,920 --> 00:16:19,920
I'm Kashiage Nata

303
00:16:19,920 --> 00:16:24,920

I'm Riko Nakayama

306
00:16:28,920 --> 00:16:30,920
Please

307
00:16:30,920 --> 00:16:35,920
Who will carry the futon?

308
00:16:35,920 --> 00:16:38,920
I will carry the futon and happiness

309
00:16:38,920 --> 00:16:40,920
Thank you

310
00:16:40,920 --> 00:16:42,920

00:17:15,920 --> 00:17:19,920
I like Ebichu

319
00:17:19,920 --> 00:17:21,920
The first answer is the best

320
00:17:21,920 --> 00:17:24,920
Bring the futon

321
00:17:24,920 --> 00:17:27,920
Kashiwaiki

Matsuno

330
00:17:53,920 --> 00:17:57,920
I like Takoyaki

331
00:17:57,920 --> 00:17:59,920
No

332
00:17:59,920 --> 00:18:01,920
Ebichu

333
00:18:01,920 --> 00:18:03,920
Matsuno

334
00:18:03,920 --> 00:18:05,920
Rina

335
00:18:05,920 --> 00:18:07,920
I see

336
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:09,920

337
00:18:09,920 --> 00:18:11,920
Yay

338
00:18:11,920 --> 00:18:13,920
Nakayama

339
00:18:13,920 --> 00:18:17,920
Not Taa

340
00:18:17,920 --> 00:18:20,920
To

341
00:18:20,920 --> 00:18:22,920
It's very hot

342
00:18:22,920 --> 00:18:27,920
I can't think

343
00:18:27,920 --> 00:18:29,920
It's a scary story

344
00:18:29,920 --> 00:18:31,920
Why did you change the Taa?

345
00:18:31,920 --> 00:18:33,920
It's hot

346
00:18:33,920 --> 00:18:36,920
You did it with Tosu?

347
00:18:36,920 --> 00:18:39,920
I wanted to start with Tosu

348
00:18:39,920 --> 00:18:41,920
Don't say that

349
00:18:41,920 --> 00:18:43,920
I wanted to start with Tosu

350
00:18:43,920 --> 00:18:49,920
Next question

351
00:18:49,920 --> 00:18:51,920
Here it is

352
00:18:51,920 --> 00:18:53,920
Hoshina

353
00:18:53,920 --> 00:18:57,920
Write the answer

354
00:18:57,920 --> 00:18:59,920
I will write with a young person

355
00:18:59,920 --> 00:19:01,920
Both are pretty

356
00:19:01,920 --> 00:19:05,920
It's pretty but it's not as I expected

357
00:19:05,920 --> 00:19:09,920
Peach Peach

358
00:19:09,920 --> 00:19:11,920
Nakayama

359
00:19:11,920 --> 00:19:13,920
Write with Chuuen

360
00:19:13,920 --> 00:19:16,920
I will write with a strong person

361
00:19:16,920 --> 00:19:20,920
Both are cute

362
00:19:20,920 --> 00:19:23,920
Let's give Nakayama one

363
00:19:23,920 --> 00:19:25,920
Yay

364
00:19:25,920 --> 00:19:27,920
Kashiwaiki

365
00:19:27,920 --> 00:19:29,920
I will write with Hirota Aika

366
00:19:29,920 --> 00:19:32,920
I will write with people who are getting
married

367
00:19:32,920 --> 00:19:36,920
Both are lovely

368
00:19:36,920 --> 00:19:38,920
It's pretty

369
00:19:38,920 --> 00:19:40,920
Open one

370
00:19:40,920 --> 00:19:43,920
My friends said that

371
00:19:43,920 --> 00:19:45,920
That's a thief

372
00:19:45,920 --> 00:19:50,920
There was a mystery class in elementary
school

373
00:19:50,920 --> 00:19:52,920
Mystery class?

374
00:19:52,920 --> 00:19:55,920
Sorry, I'm still thinking of mystery
class

375
00:19:55,920 --> 00:19:57,920
You can do that

376
00:19:57,920 --> 00:20:00,920
I wrote with a fan

377
00:20:00,920 --> 00:20:03,920
I wrote with a fan

378
00:20:03,920 --> 00:20:06,920
I will write with a fan

379
00:20:06,920 --> 00:20:08,920
I will send a signal

380
00:20:08,920 --> 00:20:11,920
Both have to be blue

381
00:20:11,920 --> 00:20:15,920
The fan is gone

382
00:20:15,920 --> 00:20:18,920
You were expressing it with your face

383
00:20:18,920 --> 00:20:21,920
I wrote with a fan

384
00:20:21,920 --> 00:20:23,920
After that

385
00:20:23,920 --> 00:20:26,920
Nakayama

386
00:20:26,920 --> 00:20:29,920
I wrote with a wrong face

387
00:20:29,920 --> 00:20:31,920
It's in the pot

388
00:20:31,920 --> 00:20:33,920
After that

389
00:20:33,920 --> 00:20:37,920
They got a lot of buttons

390
00:20:37,920 --> 00:20:41,920
The third one is Haranga

391
00:20:41,920 --> 00:20:43,920
Here is the topic

392
00:20:43,920 --> 00:20:46,920
Pay attention to the members' words

393
00:20:46,920 --> 00:20:48,920
Hiratsuka

394
00:20:48,920 --> 00:20:50,920
Bring me something

395
00:20:50,920 --> 00:20:52,920
From now on

396
00:20:52,920 --> 00:20:55,920
Everyone in the shrimp is a guard

397
00:20:55,920 --> 00:20:57,920
I will say go down

398
00:20:57,920 --> 00:21:00,920
I will ask what happened

399
00:21:00,920 --> 00:21:03,920
Please answer

400
00:21:03,920 --> 00:21:05,920
Go down

401
00:21:05,920 --> 00:21:07,920
Pay up

402
00:21:07,920 --> 00:21:08,920
What happened?

403
00:21:08,920 --> 00:21:10,920
I'm practicing live

404
00:21:10,920 --> 00:21:12,920
Good job

405
00:21:12,920 --> 00:21:14,920
Amazing

406
00:21:14,920 --> 00:21:17,920
It's like a show

407
00:21:17,920 --> 00:21:19,920
Nakayama

408
00:21:19,920 --> 00:21:22,920
Don't go

409
00:21:22,920 --> 00:21:24,920
One

410
00:21:24,920 --> 00:21:27,920
It's cute

411
00:21:27,920 --> 00:21:30,920
It's not related to the topic

412
00:21:30,920 --> 00:21:33,920
Please watch it

413
00:21:33,920 --> 00:21:35,920
Take two

414
00:21:35,920 --> 00:21:37,920
Pay up

415
00:21:37,920 --> 00:21:39,920
I'm surprised

416
00:21:39,920 --> 00:21:41,920
Take one

417
00:21:41,920 --> 00:21:43,920
Don't go

418
00:21:43,920 --> 00:21:45,920
Take one

419
00:21:45,920 --> 00:21:47,920
Hiratsuka

420
00:21:47,920 --> 00:21:49,920
Wait

421
00:21:49,920 --> 00:21:51,920
I'm hungry

422
00:21:51,920 --> 00:21:54,920
I'm hungry

423
00:21:54,920 --> 00:21:57,920
Nakayama

424
00:21:57,920 --> 00:21:59,920
One

425
00:21:59,920 --> 00:22:01,920
Here it is

426
00:22:01,920 --> 00:22:03,920
Matsuno

427
00:22:03,920 --> 00:22:06,920
I took a new picture

428
00:22:06,920 --> 00:22:08,920
Keep

429
00:22:08,920 --> 00:22:10,920
Nakayama

430
00:22:10,920 --> 00:22:12,920
Wait

431
00:22:12,920 --> 00:22:14,920
Kakashi

432
00:22:14,920 --> 00:22:16,920
One

433
00:22:16,920 --> 00:22:19,920
Here it is

434
00:22:19,920 --> 00:22:21,920
Matsuno

435
00:22:21,920 --> 00:22:23,920
You are cute

436
00:22:23,920 --> 00:22:27,920
Would you like to eat this fish with me
tonight?

437
00:22:27,920 --> 00:22:29,920
One

438
00:22:29,920 --> 00:22:31,920
I did it

439
00:22:31,920 --> 00:22:34,920
You were trying to show the fish

440
00:22:34,920 --> 00:22:36,920
Here it is

441
00:22:36,920 --> 00:22:38,920
The first hero

442
00:22:38,920 --> 00:22:40,920
One

443
00:22:40,920 --> 00:22:43,920
The technique is good

444
00:22:43,920 --> 00:22:46,920
Here it is

445
00:22:46,920 --> 00:22:49,920
The hamburger with the new fish

446
00:22:49,920 --> 00:22:51,920
One

447
00:22:51,920 --> 00:22:53,920
Here it is

448
00:22:53,920 --> 00:22:55,920
I did it

449
00:22:55,920 --> 00:22:58,920
What are you doing?

450
00:22:58,920 --> 00:23:00,920
Stop

451
00:23:00,920 --> 00:23:02,920
One

452
00:23:02,920 --> 00:23:05,920
Here it is

453
00:23:05,920 --> 00:23:07,920
Please

454
00:23:07,920 --> 00:23:11,920
The new fish is shining

455
00:23:11,920 --> 00:23:14,920
Take one

456
00:23:14,920 --> 00:23:16,920
It's over

457
00:23:16,920 --> 00:23:20,920
The new fish is funny

458
00:23:20,920 --> 00:23:22,920
The new fish is funny

459
00:23:22,920 --> 00:23:25,920
The new fish is funny

460
00:23:25,920 --> 00:23:29,920
We look forward to seeing the new fish

461
00:23:29,920 --> 00:23:34,920
The mini-conert festival is over

462
00:23:34,920 --> 00:23:36,920
What did the members think?

463
00:23:36,920 --> 00:23:38,920
We did it

464
00:23:38,920 --> 00:23:41,920
How was it?

465
00:23:41,920 --> 00:23:45,920
Maybe the next hero will be born

466
00:23:45,920 --> 00:23:47,920
Maybe

467
00:23:47,920 --> 00:23:49,920
The hero who can beat you

468
00:23:49,920 --> 00:23:51,920
Really?

469
00:23:51,920 --> 00:23:53,920
Okatsu

470
00:23:53,920 --> 00:23:57,920
I made a new legend

471
00:23:57,920 --> 00:24:00,920
I made a new legend

472
00:24:00,920 --> 00:24:03,920
We started from the reflection

473
00:24:03,920 --> 00:24:05,920
It's serious

474
00:24:05,920 --> 00:24:07,920
Okatsu is serious

475
00:24:07,920 --> 00:24:11,920
How was it?

476
00:24:11,920 --> 00:24:15,920
We have a new hero

477
00:24:15,920 --> 00:24:18,920
I want to draw

478
00:24:18,920 --> 00:24:20,920
I want to draw

479
00:24:20,920 --> 00:24:22,920
What?

480
00:24:22,920 --> 00:24:24,920
What?

481
00:24:24,920 --> 00:24:26,920
What is it?

482
00:24:26,920 --> 00:24:28,920
I saw it

483
00:24:28,920 --> 00:24:30,920
What is it?

484
00:24:30,920 --> 00:24:32,920
Pass

485
00:24:32,920 --> 00:24:37,920
Watch the VTR

486
00:24:37,920 --> 00:24:40,920
The mini-conert festival with two new
characters

487
00:24:40,920 --> 00:24:43,920
I look forward to the future

488
00:24:43,920 --> 00:24:46,920
Next episode

489
00:24:46,920 --> 00:24:50,920
New song special

490
00:24:50,920 --> 00:24:56,920
New song information

491
00:24:56,920 --> 00:25:02,920
What will happen to the big monster?

492
00:25:02,920 --> 00:25:07,920
And the person who missed Ebichu Tastas

493
00:25:07,920 --> 00:25:10,920
On the star dust channel of the school
video distribution site

494
00:25:10,920 --> 00:25:14,920
Ebichu Tastas is being released

495
00:25:14,920 --> 00:25:16,920
I'm not going

496
00:25:16,920 --> 00:25:18,920
I'm not going

497
00:25:18,920 --> 00:25:20,920
If you want to enjoy more like Nakayama

498
00:25:20,920 --> 00:25:24,920
Ebichu Tastas is free of charge for 400
yen per month

499
00:25:24,920 --> 00:25:28,920
There are also a lot of exclusive videos
that are not released

00:25:28,920 --> 00:25:32,920
Search for the details on the star dust
channel

501
00:25:32,920 --> 00:25:39,920
This program was provided by the sponsor
you see

502
00:25:39,920 --> 00:25:44,920
This is good

503
00:25:44,920 --> 00:25:46,920
I'm doing it

504
00:25:46,920 --> 00:25:48,920
I'm doing it

505
00:25:48,920 --> 00:25:52,920
A big number

506
00:25:52,920 --> 00:25:54,920
