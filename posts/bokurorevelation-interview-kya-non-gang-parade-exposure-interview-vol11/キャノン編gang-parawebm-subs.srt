1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,500
Hi, I'm Kouro.

2
00:00:01,500 --> 00:00:03,000
Hi, I'm Iggy.

3
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:04,500
Hi, I'm Moshi Moshi.

4
00:00:04,500 --> 00:00:08,000
The moment I got the call, they said it
was an animal park.

5
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,500
They said it was a gorilla group.

6
00:00:10,500 --> 00:00:30,906
I thought it was a place where I could
be in.

7
00:00:30,906 --> 00:00:35,906
It's a little embarrassing, but...

8
00:00:35,906 --> 00:00:40,906
So, KANOUN, I'd like to interview you
today.

9
00:00:40,906 --> 00:00:43,906
I'm sure no one's watching.

10
00:00:43,906 --> 00:00:48,906
I'd like you to talk roughly.

11
00:00:48,906 --> 00:00:51,906
It's an interview that follows history.

12
00:00:51,906 --> 00:01:00,906
So, I'd like to hear from you about the
Gang Parade.

13
00:01:00,906 --> 00:01:02,906
How did you feel?

14
00:01:02,906 --> 00:01:07,906
I liked the Gang Parade as a group.

15
00:01:07,906 --> 00:01:12,906
I was happy that the Gang Parade was
restarted.

16
00:01:12,906 --> 00:01:17,906
I was also happy to be there.

17
00:01:17,906 --> 00:01:19,168
Thank you for watching.

18
00:01:19,168 --> 00:01:28,168
I really liked the Gyanpare I saw in the
movie.

19
00:01:28,168 --> 00:01:37,168
I thought it was a kind of rebellious
spirit.

20
00:01:37,168 --> 00:01:42,168
I don't want to lose to anyone.

21
00:01:42,168 --> 00:01:45,168
Nice to meet you. We are

22
00:01:45,168 --> 00:01:51,168
Enjoy Play! We are the next Gyanpare!

23
00:01:51,168 --> 00:01:54,168
When did you start liking us?

24
00:01:54,168 --> 00:01:58,168
I started liking us in 2018 or 2017.

25
00:01:58,168 --> 00:02:03,168
Did you start working in 2017?

26
00:02:03,168 --> 00:02:05,168
Gyanpare?

27
00:02:05,168 --> 00:02:10,168
No, I was in a different group.

28
00:02:10,168 --> 00:02:16,168
Gyanpare was the group that I was in for
the first time.

29
00:02:16,168 --> 00:02:17,168
What about you, Baby?

30
00:02:17,168 --> 00:02:19,792
I was also in the same group.

31
00:02:19,792 --> 00:02:24,292
And then, Go to the別パラダイスズ, 5th one.

32
00:02:24,292 --> 00:02:27,292
1, 2, 3, 6th one?

33
00:02:27,292 --> 00:02:29,292
6th one.

34
00:02:29,292 --> 00:02:36,292
Which group was the most in the group?

35
00:02:36,292 --> 00:02:41,280
The last one was...

36
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:45,280
I think that was the hardest time.

37
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:49,280
I think it was hard because there were
so many people.

38
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:52,280
There are so many people in the gang.

39
00:02:52,280 --> 00:02:57,280
Who do you think is the most childish?

40
00:02:57,280 --> 00:02:59,280
Yuka Terashima?

41
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:02,280
That's an unexpected answer.

42
00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:08,280
Everyone was attacking me for not taking
the painkiller.

43
00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:12,280
I've been told that many times.

44
00:03:12,280 --> 00:03:17,280
I was told that I have a painkiller but
I can't carry it.

45
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:22,280
I was told that if there were 13 people,
someone would give it to me.

46
00:03:22,280 --> 00:03:25,280
I tried to hit him once.

47
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:27,280
That's right.

48
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:30,280
Interviewers are really difficult.

49
00:03:30,280 --> 00:03:33,280
I haven't decided to ask this.

50
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:38,280
The period of history has come.

51
00:03:38,280 --> 00:03:40,280
I think I was in the middle of that.

52
00:03:40,280 --> 00:03:42,280
Anything is fine.

53
00:03:42,280 --> 00:03:46,280
We participated in the training camp.

54
00:03:46,280 --> 00:03:50,280
There were so many things to gain at the
camp.

55
00:03:50,280 --> 00:03:55,280
We passed the test.

56
00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:57,280
I also participated in the canon.

57
00:03:57,280 --> 00:04:03,280
We lost the marathon at the camp.

58
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:05,280
How was it?

59
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:13,280
I was the last one to decide to go to
the camp.

60
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:16,280
I couldn't prepare at all.

61
00:04:16,280 --> 00:04:18,280
My legs were slow.

62
00:04:18,280 --> 00:04:24,280
I was running, but I didn't think
everyone was fast.

63
00:04:24,280 --> 00:04:27,280
You said you decided right before the
camp.

64
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:29,280
Did you have any problems?

65
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:32,280
I had a lot of problems.

66
00:04:32,280 --> 00:04:34,280
What kind of problems?

67
00:04:34,280 --> 00:04:36,280
Men?

68
00:04:36,280 --> 00:04:40,280
It has nothing to do with men.

69
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:44,280
I'll go back to the topic.

70
00:04:44,280 --> 00:04:50,280
It's not a cohabitation, but 13 people
are together.

71
00:04:50,280 --> 00:04:53,280
There are some difficult things.

72
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:57,280
I'm not good at group activities.

73
00:04:57,280 --> 00:05:01,280
I'm a busy person, so I can't wait.

74
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:05,280
I think everyone is kind.

75
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:11,280
What if you have a favorite type of man?

76
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:16,280
What if he's a little bit thick?

77
00:05:16,280 --> 00:05:18,280
I can't.

78
00:05:18,280 --> 00:05:20,280
I have a lot of types.

79
00:05:20,280 --> 00:05:22,280
It's impossible if you don't match your
personality.

80
00:05:22,280 --> 00:05:25,280
I don't like people who are loose on
time.

81
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:31,280
So you mean there's a man who's been
loose on time?

82
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:34,280
There's no one.

83
00:05:34,280 --> 00:05:42,280
I'm sure the people who are watching
this are thinking that they like the
camp.

84
00:05:42,280 --> 00:05:46,280
I don't think it's a little bit of a
problem.

85
00:05:46,280 --> 00:05:53,280
I want to hear about the men I've met so
far.

86
00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:55,280
Did you ask me?

87
00:05:55,280 --> 00:05:59,280
I was told to do it freely.

88
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:02,280
I'm going to do something different from
people.

89
00:06:02,280 --> 00:06:04,280
It's only at times like this.

90
00:06:04,280 --> 00:06:09,280
Ordinary interviews don't ask idols
about their love.

91
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:11,280
What was the problem?

92
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:13,280
The problem was...

93
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:17,280
I don't know.

94
00:06:17,978 --> 00:06:26,978
I don't think I've ever seen you
apologize to someone.

95
00:06:26,978 --> 00:06:32,978
I'm sorry. I'm sorry for what I did.

96
00:06:32,978 --> 00:06:36,978
Thank you for waiting for me.

97
00:06:36,978 --> 00:06:42,170
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

98
00:06:42,170 --> 00:06:44,170
I'm sorry.

99
00:06:44,170 --> 00:06:48,170
Why do you keep saying things that you
can't use?

100
00:06:48,170 --> 00:06:50,170
Please explain.

101
00:06:50,170 --> 00:06:57,170
It was an interview to ask a lot of P.

102
00:06:57,170 --> 00:06:59,170
Oh, really?

103
00:06:59,170 --> 00:07:02,170
A big success!

104
00:07:02,170 --> 00:07:08,170
Ask the next person more P.

105
00:07:08,170 --> 00:07:12,170
Okay.

106
00:07:20,090 --> 00:07:26,090
I pretended not to hear you, even though
I could hear you

107
00:07:26,090 --> 00:07:30,090
I pretended to be stupid and gave up

108
00:07:30,090 --> 00:07:34,098
I can't see the future
