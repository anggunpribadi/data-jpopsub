This time, in order to make the idea for the picture book that was presented at the previous location shoot more detailed and interesting, the youngest duo of Batten Girls' Corps, Rirumiyu, went to Fukuoka High School attached to Tokai University in order to borrow the help of the students. ! âœ¨

Colorhythm Risa, an art performer who actually supervised and illustrated this picture book, also came to visit us! ðŸŽ¨

What kind of picture book will it turn out to be? ? ðŸ“•âœ¨
