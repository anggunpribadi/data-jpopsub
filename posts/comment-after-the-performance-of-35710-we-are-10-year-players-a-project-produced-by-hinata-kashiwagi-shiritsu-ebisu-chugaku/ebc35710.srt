1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,000
We finished the 10th year competition
with Shirito Ebichu School Kajiwagi
Hina.

2
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:19,000
So, these 10 years have been made by
Mayama, Aya-chan, Mirei-chan, and me.

3
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:24,000
We've been friends since the time of the
major debut, Indie-z.

4
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:29,728
We've been friends for over 10 years, so
we're called the 10-year-old players.

5
00:00:29,728 --> 00:00:42,028
We've been together for over 10 years,
so we wanted to make a live performance
that felt like a live performance.

6
00:00:42,028 --> 00:00:45,028
That's why we made this set list.

7
00:00:45,028 --> 00:00:50,328
It's a nostalgic medley I used to play
when I was in Indies.

8
00:00:50,328 --> 00:00:57,328
I'm an adult now, so I can't do it
because I'm too old.

9
00:00:57,328 --> 00:00:57,392
I'm an adult now, so I can't do it
because I'm too old.

10
00:00:57,392 --> 00:01:04,892
I'm a mochi miko in the middle of the
night, and I'm the one who can do it
because I'm a member.

11
00:01:04,892 --> 00:01:09,692
The medley and the mochi miko are the
best.

12
00:01:09,692 --> 00:01:14,492
And the adult rock part.

13
00:01:14,492 --> 00:01:19,292
We've grown up and grown up.

14
00:01:19,292 --> 00:01:27,292
I'm glad that I was able to show
everything at once in a live show that
feels like history.

15
00:01:27,376 --> 00:01:31,376
I thought about various things.

16
00:01:31,376 --> 00:01:39,376
I think there were many people who
supported me in this era.

17
00:01:39,376 --> 00:01:43,376
And also people who supported me before
I debuted as a major.

18
00:01:43,376 --> 00:01:48,376
Today, I was in the front row, and
everyone was nostalgic.

19
00:01:48,376 --> 00:01:52,376
I'm having a lot of fun, and I'm
excited.

20
00:01:52,376 --> 00:01:54,376
I'm crying.

21
00:01:54,376 --> 00:01:54,992
Thank you for watching.

22
00:01:54,992 --> 00:02:01,992
I was impressed by all the people who
were looking forward to this.

23
00:02:01,992 --> 00:02:12,232
After all, the one that made me the eye
was the old indie medley.

24
00:02:12,232 --> 00:02:17,632
I was nervous. I did it in the five
songs.

25
00:02:17,632 --> 00:02:21,232
There are people who know it and there
are people who don't know it.

26
00:02:21,232 --> 00:02:22,896
I'm looking forward to it.

27
00:02:22,896 --> 00:02:30,256
I thought you would see it, but we were
also doing lessons.

28
00:02:30,256 --> 00:02:33,136
I remember the choreography
unexpectedly.

29
00:02:33,136 --> 00:02:37,024
It was like this last time, I mentioned
it like this, but you said it was like
this last time.

30
00:02:37,024 --> 00:02:40,424
It was really fun to do it with the
choreography.

31
00:02:41,424 --> 00:02:44,424
So, the one that impressed me was the
medley,

32
00:02:44,824 --> 00:02:48,824
and the last one, Fantastic Baby Love,

33
00:02:49,324 --> 00:02:53,724
I thought it was good to do it here.

34
00:02:54,124 --> 00:03:00,924
I'm glad I could hear from the fans,
too.

35
00:03:00,924 --> 00:03:06,924
I'm sorry for giving up for 8 years.

36
00:03:08,736 --> 00:03:11,496
I was really worried when I was making
it.

37
00:03:11,496 --> 00:03:23,296
After finishing it, I was happy to hear
that the other members had fun.

38
00:03:23,296 --> 00:03:27,396
I'm really relieved that I can finish it
safely.

39
00:03:27,396 --> 00:03:33,036
There is a performance and a singing
contest plan, so I would like to enjoy
it until the end.

40
00:03:33,036 --> 00:03:34,976
I had fun today.

41
00:03:34,976 --> 00:03:39,536
Thank you very much.
