00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Ebichu's video

00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:50,800
Movement of a

3
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,560
I'm really sorry

4
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:37,360
But look, look at the sky

5
00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:38,960
I want to be able to do it

6
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:44,080
I'm working hard, I'm working hard

7
00:01:44,080 --> 00:01:50,480
I want to be able to do it

8
00:01:50,480 --> 00:01:56,880
I'm working hard, I'm working hard

9
00:01:56,880 --> 00:02:02,000
I want to be able to do it

10
00:02:22,202 --> 00:02:23,202
What?

11
00:02:27,202 --> 00:02:28,202
Here it comes.

12
00:02:29,202 --> 00:02:30,202
Here it comes.

13
00:02:42,202 --> 00:02:44,202
Tenkai Pin!

14
00:02:44,202 --> 00:02:52,202
Tenkai Pin!

15
00:02:53,202 --> 00:02:57,202
Karin-kun, happy birthday!

16
00:02:57,202 --> 00:03:11,202
Karin, Karin, happy birthday!

17
00:03:11,202 --> 00:03:30,202
Thank you!

18
00:03:31,034 --> 00:03:33,034
I think it's a very nice chair.

19
00:03:33,034 --> 00:03:35,034
I'm not dead.

20
00:03:35,034 --> 00:03:37,034
I'm not dead.

21
00:03:37,034 --> 00:03:39,034
I'm not dead.

22
00:03:39,034 --> 00:03:41,034
I'm not dead.

23
00:03:41,034 --> 00:03:45,034
Manaprafest was also a very moving
stage.

24
00:03:45,034 --> 00:03:51,034
I'm crying because of the love of the
Tohoku group.

25
00:03:51,034 --> 00:03:53,034
I don't know what you're talking about,
but I'm crying.

26
00:03:53,034 --> 00:03:55,034
Thank you very much.

27
00:03:55,034 --> 00:03:57,034
Congratulations.

28
00:03:57,034 --> 00:04:01,034
Thank you.

29
00:04:01,034 --> 00:04:03,034
Thank you.

30
00:04:03,034 --> 00:04:05,034
3, 2, 1.

31
00:04:05,034 --> 00:04:07,034
I'll do it with a great smile.

32
00:04:07,034 --> 00:04:09,034
3, 2, 1.

33
00:04:09,034 --> 00:04:11,034
Smile, smile, smile.

34
00:04:11,034 --> 00:04:13,034
It's so cute.

35
00:04:13,034 --> 00:04:15,034
3, 2, 1.

36
00:04:15,034 --> 00:04:17,034
Thank you.

37
00:04:17,034 --> 00:04:35,034
Thank you.

38
00:04:35,258 --> 00:04:39,258
The first participant is this person.

39
00:04:42,258 --> 00:04:47,258
Welcome, everyone. This is the Akita
City Cultural Center's big hall.

40
00:04:47,258 --> 00:04:52,258
Mr. Yomuin, we are really happy to have
been able to enter the Akita Cultural
Center.

41
00:04:52,258 --> 00:04:56,258
I'm glad to hear that.

42
00:04:56,258 --> 00:05:01,258
Oh, it's the place where Ms. Satokagura,
the live-hage, will be performing.

43
00:05:01,258 --> 00:05:05,258
I want to see the live-hage for once.

44
00:05:05,258 --> 00:05:09,258
Live-hage? Stop saying that like
sashimi.

45
00:05:09,258 --> 00:05:11,258
What? I don't understand.

46
00:05:11,258 --> 00:05:13,258
You know, it's kind of...

47
00:05:13,258 --> 00:05:15,258
Then, do you have the grilled live-hage?

48
00:05:15,258 --> 00:05:17,258
Do you have the steamed live-hage?

49
00:05:17,258 --> 00:05:18,258
Wait, wait.

50
00:05:18,258 --> 00:05:21,258
Don't fight until you come to Akita.

51
00:05:21,258 --> 00:05:49,258
Hahaha, the new students this year are
in good spirits.

52
00:05:49,258 --> 00:05:51,258
The live-hage is over.

53
00:05:51,258 --> 00:05:53,258
It's over.

54
00:05:53,258 --> 00:05:58,874
The live-hage is over.

55
00:05:58,874 --> 00:06:02,874
It was cool.

56
00:06:02,874 --> 00:06:06,874
I was surprised to see it for the first
time.

57
00:06:06,874 --> 00:06:10,874
I was the first to see it.

58
00:06:10,874 --> 00:06:14,874
It was the closest.

59
00:06:14,874 --> 00:06:19,374
The power of the

60
00:06:19,374 --> 00:06:22,874
Taiko was amazing.

61
00:06:22,874 --> 00:06:26,874
I was very impressed.

62
00:06:26,874 --> 00:06:30,874
I'm looking forward to it.

63
00:06:30,874 --> 00:06:34,874
I'm going to show you the performance.

64
00:06:34,874 --> 00:07:00,874
Let's go.

65
00:07:04,874 --> 00:07:08,874
That's it.

66
00:07:08,874 --> 00:07:12,874
I'm going to show you the performance.

67
00:07:12,874 --> 00:07:16,874
Let's go.

68
00:07:16,874 --> 00:07:20,874
It was cool.

69
00:07:20,874 --> 00:07:24,874
I was very impressed.

70
00:07:24,874 --> 00:07:27,002
I'm going to show you the performance.

71
00:07:42,170 --> 00:07:44,570
I sweated a lot during rehearsal.

72
00:07:44,570 --> 00:07:46,870
It's really cold now.

73
00:07:46,870 --> 00:07:48,770
So I'm going to wear a parka.

74
00:07:50,170 --> 00:07:51,870
Go to the bathroom.

75
00:07:51,870 --> 00:07:52,870
Hurry up.

76
00:07:52,870 --> 00:07:53,870
Sorry.

77
00:07:53,870 --> 00:07:54,470
Hey.

78
00:07:54,470 --> 00:07:55,870
Sorry, Kanoi.

79
00:07:55,870 --> 00:07:56,770
Hey.

80
00:07:56,770 --> 00:07:57,770
Sorry.

81
00:07:57,770 --> 00:07:59,670
How many hours have passed?

82
00:07:59,670 --> 00:08:00,870
Sorry.

83
00:08:00,870 --> 00:08:02,270
It's not that painful.

84
00:08:02,270 --> 00:08:03,170
No.

85
00:08:03,170 --> 00:08:05,870
Let's go.

86
00:08:05,870 --> 00:08:08,370
Where's the kick time?

87
00:08:08,370 --> 00:08:12,170
I'm sorry.

88
00:08:12,218 --> 00:08:14,218
There is no big white one.

89
00:08:14,218 --> 00:08:16,218
There it is.

90
00:08:17,218 --> 00:08:19,218
This is good.

91
00:08:19,218 --> 00:08:21,218
What?

92
00:08:21,218 --> 00:08:28,442
Thank you.

93
00:08:28,442 --> 00:08:30,442
It's a chance to get a finger-in-the-
finger.

94
00:08:34,442 --> 00:08:36,442
Shiritu, F-shichiyu, Kukkut.

95
00:08:36,442 --> 00:08:38,442
Then, it will come out.

96
00:08:38,442 --> 00:08:40,442
Will you get angry?

97
00:08:40,442 --> 00:08:42,442
I was a little angry.

98
00:08:42,442 --> 00:08:44,442
I was a little angry.

99
00:08:46,442 --> 00:08:48,442
After that,

100
00:08:48,442 --> 00:08:52,442
I will do a rehearsal of the opening of
the Coddy.

101
00:08:52,442 --> 00:08:53,442
What?

102
00:08:53,442 --> 00:08:55,442
Shiritu, F-shichiyu, Kukkut.

103
00:08:55,442 --> 00:08:56,442
It's coming out.

104
00:08:56,442 --> 00:08:58,442
I will get a finger-in-the-finger.

105
00:08:58,442 --> 00:09:01,442
I've been watching Kamisoul Brothers
since then.

106
00:09:01,442 --> 00:09:03,442
It's very interesting.

107
00:09:12,442 --> 00:09:13,442
Please.

108
00:09:13,442 --> 00:09:27,442
Shiritu, F-shichiyu, Kukkut.

109
00:09:27,442 --> 00:09:28,442
It's coming out.

110
00:09:29,442 --> 00:09:30,442
I was a little angry.

111
00:09:30,442 --> 00:09:31,442
I was a little angry.

112
00:09:31,442 --> 00:09:41,442
Thank you for watching.

113
00:09:41,882 --> 00:09:43,882
I'm sorry.

114
00:09:45,882 --> 00:09:47,882
I'm here.

115
00:09:47,882 --> 00:09:49,882
Again.

116
00:09:49,882 --> 00:10:04,058
Again.

117
00:10:59,354 --> 00:11:01,354
Thank you.

118
00:11:37,802 --> 00:11:39,802
I'm sorry.

119
00:11:39,802 --> 00:11:41,802
Thank you.

120
00:11:41,802 --> 00:11:43,802
Thank you.

121
00:11:43,802 --> 00:11:45,802
Thank you.

122
00:11:45,802 --> 00:11:47,802
I can't see anything because it's dark.

123
00:11:47,802 --> 00:11:49,802
Thank you.

124
00:11:49,802 --> 00:11:51,802
I took a good picture.

125
00:11:51,802 --> 00:11:53,802
I can't see anything because it's dark.

126
00:11:53,802 --> 00:11:55,802
Turn around.

127
00:11:57,802 --> 00:11:59,802
It's very dark.

128
00:11:59,802 --> 00:12:01,802
I can't see anything.

129
00:12:01,802 --> 00:12:04,538
Thank you.

130
00:12:34,538 --> 00:12:39,482
Thank you for watching.

131
00:12:39,482 --> 00:12:43,962
Know your elementary school friends!

132
00:12:46,402 --> 00:13:00,142
Today, we invite all the pads Мы are not
changing the

133
00:13:00,142 --> 00:13:02,142
Thank you for watching.

134
00:13:05,978 --> 00:13:11,978
That's all for the photo shoot. Thank
you for your time during rehearsal.

135
00:13:11,978 --> 00:13:36,978
Now, please enjoy the live performance.

136
00:13:41,978 --> 00:13:43,978
Now, please enjoy the live performance.

137
00:14:07,802 --> 00:14:09,802
The second round is over.

138
00:14:11,802 --> 00:14:13,802
5 back jumps.

139
00:14:13,802 --> 00:14:18,802
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10.

140
00:14:18,802 --> 00:14:20,802
I'm done.

141
00:14:22,802 --> 00:14:24,802
Let's take a deep breath.

142
00:14:27,802 --> 00:14:29,802
How do you breathe?

143
00:14:29,802 --> 00:14:30,802
Breathe in.

144
00:14:30,802 --> 00:14:31,034
Thank you for your viewing.

145
00:14:31,034 --> 00:14:33,774
I'll come in naturally

146
00:14:33,774 --> 00:14:34,774
I got it

147
00:14:34,774 --> 00:14:37,274
Then I'll try to wear it

148
00:14:37,274 --> 00:14:39,274
Haa

149
00:14:39,274 --> 00:14:41,274
I wore it

150
00:14:41,274 --> 00:14:43,274
I'm tired so I'll do this

151
00:14:45,274 --> 00:14:46,274
I'm tired

152
00:14:46,274 --> 00:14:49,274
We couldn't do it last year

153
00:14:49,274 --> 00:14:54,274
It's really grateful that we can do a
big live once a year

154
00:14:54,274 --> 00:14:56,274
First of all, thank you to the
environment

155
00:14:56,274 --> 00:15:00,274
Thank you to the audience and viewers

156
00:15:00,274 --> 00:15:06,274
Even if there are various things, we are
perfect on stage

157
00:15:06,274 --> 00:15:10,274
We are the idol of Ebichu, so let's
enjoy

158
00:15:10,274 --> 00:15:12,274
Are you tired?

159
00:15:12,274 --> 00:15:13,274
Where are we?

160
00:15:13,274 --> 00:15:14,274
Aichi-chan!

161
00:15:14,274 --> 00:15:15,274
We are Ebichu!

162
00:15:15,274 --> 00:15:18,274
Let's go to the song Ebichu!

163
00:15:18,274 --> 00:15:22,586
Thank you for your hard work!

164
00:15:22,586 --> 00:15:34,146
SENTRAL FILM

165
00:16:55,130 --> 00:16:58,130
I got this from Kobayashi CFO.

166
00:16:58,130 --> 00:17:00,130
How is it?

167
00:17:04,130 --> 00:17:06,130
This is a painting by Kobayashi CFO.

168
00:17:06,130 --> 00:17:15,421
One of the world's most important
connections.
