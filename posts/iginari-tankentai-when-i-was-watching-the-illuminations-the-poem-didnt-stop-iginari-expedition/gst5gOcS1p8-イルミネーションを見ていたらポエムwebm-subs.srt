1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,600
Iinari Tanken Taisui! Iinari Tanken
Taisui!

2
00:00:03,600 --> 00:00:06,160
I'm Yasumori Waka! I'm Shichiro Shinji!

3
00:00:06,160 --> 00:00:08,880
Thank you for your cooperation!

4
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:11,400
We are Iinari Tanken Taisui!

5
00:00:11,400 --> 00:00:14,200
Today, these two are in their private
clothes, right?

6
00:00:14,200 --> 00:00:15,760
Yes!

7
00:00:15,760 --> 00:00:19,000
Yasuko-san is so cool!

8
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:20,760
So cool!

9
00:00:20,760 --> 00:00:21,600
It's all black!

10
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:22,720
It's the opposite of the color of the
back!

11
00:00:22,720 --> 00:00:24,240
That's true!

12
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:26,080
Coolness and cuteness!

13
00:00:26,080 --> 00:00:27,120
So cute!

14
00:00:27,120 --> 00:00:28,480
It's amazing!

15
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:29,424
So cute!

16
00:00:29,424 --> 00:00:31,424
I said it was amazing!

17
00:00:31,424 --> 00:00:33,424
Cute!

18
00:00:33,424 --> 00:00:37,424
We came in our personal clothes today.

19
00:00:37,424 --> 00:00:39,424
What are we going to do?

20
00:00:39,424 --> 00:00:41,424
What?

21
00:00:41,424 --> 00:00:43,424
Today's exploration is...

22
00:00:43,424 --> 00:00:45,424
Illumination!

23
00:00:45,424 --> 00:00:47,424
I'm scared!

24
00:00:49,424 --> 00:00:53,424
This year, we will also be at the 4th
floor of E-WINDS.

25
00:00:53,424 --> 00:00:55,424
It's a very old-fashioned way.

26
00:00:55,424 --> 00:00:58,944
We're going to see it together today.

27
00:00:58,944 --> 00:01:04,604
When you see beautiful illustrations,
you want to read poems, right?

28
00:01:04,604 --> 00:01:06,604
Some people are.

29
00:01:06,604 --> 00:01:08,604
Yes, it's a poem.

30
00:01:08,604 --> 00:01:10,604
Why?

31
00:01:10,604 --> 00:01:17,324
So we're going to read two poems that
are far apart.

32
00:01:17,324 --> 00:01:19,324
What kind of standard is that?

33
00:01:19,324 --> 00:01:23,584
Let's take a look at the illustrations
and make them into poems.

34
00:01:23,584 --> 00:01:27,584
Let's take that moment apart.

35
00:01:27,584 --> 00:01:27,616
ー ー ー ー

36
00:01:27,616 --> 00:01:31,896
ー ー New project. biography want to fly

37
00:01:31,896 --> 00:01:37,256
ー ー Ah, did youww • It's already
planned.

38
00:01:37,256 --> 00:01:40,776
competitions.

39
00:01:40,776 --> 00:01:46,356
ーI got injured.

40
00:01:46,356 --> 00:01:52,576
ー ーI thought the four countries friend.

41
00:01:53,336 --> 00:01:54,956
پ

42
00:01:54,956 --> 00:01:57,616
We have arrived at the 4th floor!

43
00:01:57,648 --> 00:02:03,648
Yes! It's raining!

44
00:02:03,648 --> 00:02:07,648
It's raining! It's raining!

45
00:02:07,648 --> 00:02:13,648
We are looking at the illumination of
the 4th floor of Ebins!

46
00:02:13,648 --> 00:02:15,648
It's amazing! It's so bright!

47
00:02:15,648 --> 00:02:19,648
Don't say it's bright!

48
00:02:19,648 --> 00:02:21,648
Let's take a look around!

49
00:02:21,648 --> 00:02:26,416
There is a tree in the middle of the
building!

50
00:02:26,416 --> 00:02:28,416
It's a green zone.

51
00:02:28,416 --> 00:02:30,416
The blue is beautiful.

52
00:02:30,416 --> 00:02:32,416
Let's go inside.

53
00:02:32,416 --> 00:02:34,416
Wow!

54
00:02:34,416 --> 00:02:38,416
This entrance is inviting us.

55
00:02:38,416 --> 00:02:40,416
I want to go inside.

56
00:02:40,416 --> 00:02:44,416
Don't put your hands in the door.

57
00:02:44,416 --> 00:02:48,416
If you put your hands in the door,
you'll be embarrassed.

58
00:02:48,416 --> 00:02:53,152
Let's take care of ourselves.

59
00:02:53,152 --> 00:02:55,152
I wanted to fill the space.

60
00:02:55,152 --> 00:02:59,152
I wanted to fill the strange tension
that flows through the field.

61
00:02:59,152 --> 00:03:00,152
I understand.

62
00:03:00,152 --> 00:03:01,152
That's right.

63
00:03:01,152 --> 00:03:03,152
It's funny.

64
00:03:03,152 --> 00:03:04,152
It's amazing.

65
00:03:04,152 --> 00:03:05,152
It's beautiful.

66
00:03:05,152 --> 00:03:08,152
Last year, it was colorful with flowers.

67
00:03:08,152 --> 00:03:09,152
That's right.

68
00:03:09,152 --> 00:03:11,152
It was a flower last year.

69
00:03:11,152 --> 00:03:14,152
There are flowers this year too.

70
00:03:14,152 --> 00:03:15,152
It's beautiful.

71
00:03:15,152 --> 00:03:16,152
It's beautiful.

72
00:03:16,152 --> 00:03:18,152
I feel like I'm a princess.

73
00:03:18,152 --> 00:03:22,688
I feel like I'm a princess.

74
00:03:22,688 --> 00:03:24,688
Great!

75
00:03:26,688 --> 00:03:28,688
I wonder if the tension in the
neighborhood is good.

76
00:03:28,688 --> 00:03:30,688
It's a trick.

77
00:03:34,688 --> 00:03:38,688
This butterfly can narrow the distance
between the two.

78
00:03:41,688 --> 00:03:43,688
Something is coming.

79
00:03:46,688 --> 00:03:48,688
You should be confident.

80
00:03:48,688 --> 00:03:52,688
It's a good butterfly.

81
00:03:53,850 --> 00:03:56,850
It's like the Earth.

82
00:03:58,850 --> 00:04:00,850
The Earth was blue.

83
00:04:00,850 --> 00:04:02,850
That's what it was originally.

84
00:04:02,850 --> 00:04:04,850
It's like a Gagarin.

85
00:04:04,850 --> 00:04:05,850
It's like a Wackerlin.

86
00:04:05,850 --> 00:04:06,850
It's not a Wackerlin.

87
00:04:06,850 --> 00:04:08,850
You're good at it.

88
00:04:09,850 --> 00:04:11,850
It's a human thing.

89
00:04:11,850 --> 00:04:12,850
It's a Wackerlin.

90
00:04:12,850 --> 00:04:14,850
That's not a poem.

91
00:04:14,850 --> 00:04:16,850
It's a poem.

92
00:04:17,850 --> 00:04:19,850
Look at that.

93
00:04:19,850 --> 00:04:21,850
Isn't it amazing?

94
00:04:21,850 --> 00:04:21,888
Thank you for watching.

95
00:04:21,888 --> 00:04:23,888
Look at this.

96
00:04:24,648 --> 00:04:26,648
This is a phenomenon.

97
00:04:26,648 --> 00:04:28,648
This is a phenomenon of snow.

98
00:04:28,648 --> 00:04:30,648
This is amazing.

99
00:04:30,648 --> 00:04:34,960
I hope you can see it even without snow.

100
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:36,960
Thank you.

101
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:38,960
I'm sorry.

102
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:40,960
You two shouldn't have hit each other.

103
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:42,960
I was watching.

104
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:44,960
I was watching.

105
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:46,960
Look at this.

106
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:48,960
This is a umbrella.

107
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:50,960
It's really cute.

108
00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:56,960
This is only seen when it rains.

109
00:04:56,960 --> 00:04:58,960
Of course.

110
00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:00,960
Don't poke.

111
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:02,960
Can't you all poke?

112
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:04,960
No.

113
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:08,960
You have to feel it and soak it.

114
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:10,960
You have to soak it.

115
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:12,960
That's right.

116
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:14,960
If you poke it in the air, you'll lose.

117
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:16,960
That's right.

118
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:18,960
If you go out here,

119
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:20,960
Go to the blue ball.

120
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:24,960
Is the blue ball blue?

121
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:28,432
Only blue.

122
00:05:28,432 --> 00:05:30,432
Who?

123
00:05:30,432 --> 00:05:32,432
Who?

124
00:05:32,432 --> 00:05:34,432
Who?

125
00:05:34,432 --> 00:05:36,432
I'll go there.

126
00:05:36,432 --> 00:05:38,432
I found a good place.

127
00:05:38,432 --> 00:05:40,432
Look at this.

128
00:05:40,432 --> 00:05:42,432
Oh!

129
00:05:42,432 --> 00:05:44,432
Oh!

130
00:05:44,432 --> 00:05:50,170
Who?

131
00:05:50,170 --> 00:05:52,170
It sounds amazing!

132
00:05:52,170 --> 00:05:56,170
Even if there is a place where the sound
does not sound

133
00:05:56,170 --> 00:05:58,170
Doremi Fasolassido

134
00:06:00,170 --> 00:06:02,170
It's a masterpiece

135
00:06:02,170 --> 00:06:06,768
Play your own Doremi Fasolassido

136
00:06:06,768 --> 00:06:08,768
Don't laugh

137
00:06:08,768 --> 00:06:15,768
Last year, Doremi Fasolassido was not in
the same group

138
00:06:15,768 --> 00:06:17,768
I see

139
00:06:17,768 --> 00:06:19,768
This year, Doremi Fasolassido is in the
same group

140
00:06:19,768 --> 00:06:23,768
Can you play a song?

141
00:06:26,768 --> 00:06:33,768
Last year, Hina and Rine were singing a
frog song

142
00:06:33,768 --> 00:06:36,506
Can you sing a song?

143
00:06:36,506 --> 00:06:45,338
Thank you for your viewing.

144
00:06:45,338 --> 00:07:00,338
I'm going to stop.

145
00:07:00,338 --> 00:07:04,338
What? You gave up?

146
00:07:04,338 --> 00:07:09,488
If you give up, the game is over.

147
00:07:09,488 --> 00:07:11,488
It's a human again.

148
00:07:11,488 --> 00:07:13,488
It's a Shinto tree.

149
00:07:13,488 --> 00:07:15,488
It's a safe zone.

150
00:07:15,488 --> 00:07:25,914
Thank you for your viewing.

151
00:07:25,914 --> 00:07:33,914
I'm sure I'm shining brighter than the
Illuminations, no matter how dark I
wear.

152
00:07:33,914 --> 00:07:37,344
I'm sure I'm shining brighter than the
Illuminations, no matter how dark I
wear.

153
00:07:37,344 --> 00:07:44,384
Are you wearing the costume that goes
with the performance?

154
00:07:44,384 --> 00:07:46,384
I came in black today.

155
00:07:46,384 --> 00:07:48,384
As expected.

156
00:07:48,384 --> 00:07:51,384
But the performance is different from
the preparation.

157
00:07:51,384 --> 00:07:53,384
From the costume?

158
00:07:53,384 --> 00:07:55,384
I see.

159
00:07:55,384 --> 00:07:58,384
I'm wearing black today to say this.

160
00:07:58,384 --> 00:08:00,384
The production is also solid.

161
00:08:00,384 --> 00:08:01,384
Of course.

162
00:08:01,384 --> 00:08:05,616
Hey, the Illumination is beautiful.

163
00:08:05,616 --> 00:08:08,216
But for me, you are more beautiful than
the Illumination of the

164
00:08:08,216 --> 00:08:14,616
few thousand flowers here.

165
00:08:18,116 --> 00:08:19,616
Yes!

166
00:08:19,616 --> 00:08:21,116
I got it!

167
00:08:21,116 --> 00:08:22,116
I won!

168
00:08:22,116 --> 00:08:23,116
I won!

169
00:08:23,116 --> 00:08:24,116
I won!

170
00:08:24,116 --> 00:08:25,116
I won!

171
00:08:25,116 --> 00:08:26,616
I want to make this video a paid one.

172
00:08:26,616 --> 00:08:27,616
I want to make this video a paid one.

173
00:08:27,616 --> 00:08:29,116
Who? Who?

174
00:08:29,116 --> 00:08:31,616
Who is this old man?

175
00:08:31,616 --> 00:08:35,264
Who is this?

176
00:08:35,264 --> 00:08:37,064
Prettypsychic

177
00:08:37,064 --> 00:08:39,084
This place is sooo damn cool

178
00:08:39,084 --> 00:08:53,784
I can see this soon

179
00:08:53,784 --> 00:08:55,024
So, Tchao Tchao

180
00:08:55,024 --> 00:09:03,344
Looking at Illuminati

181
00:09:03,344 --> 00:09:06,344
It's a world view that makes you feel
like you're going to die.

182
00:09:06,344 --> 00:09:11,344
As a poem artist, it's a little noisy.

183
00:09:11,344 --> 00:09:12,344
There's a customer.

184
00:09:12,344 --> 00:09:17,344
JK is playing the piano now.

185
00:09:17,344 --> 00:09:22,344
It's a normal poem-like contest.

186
00:09:22,344 --> 00:09:24,344
That's great.

187
00:09:24,344 --> 00:09:31,344
So, our illumination has nothing to do
with Christmas.

188
00:09:31,344 --> 00:09:33,344
We're going to do it until February 1st.

189
00:09:33,344 --> 00:09:35,344
Until Valentine's Day.

190
00:09:35,344 --> 00:09:37,344
Happy Valentine's Day.

191
00:09:37,344 --> 00:09:39,344
It's beautiful.

192
00:09:39,344 --> 00:09:41,760
It's beautiful.

193
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:47,760
We came here together on Christmas, but
we're so happy to be here on Valentine's
Day.

194
00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:48,760
I'm happy.

195
00:09:48,760 --> 00:09:49,760
Let's eat anything.

196
00:09:49,760 --> 00:09:50,760
Yeah.

197
00:09:50,760 --> 00:09:51,760
That's what I can do.

198
00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:53,760
What do you mean?

199
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:55,760
It's not a poem.

200
00:09:55,760 --> 00:10:02,760
I hope you guys can say this and it will
be more fun.

201
00:10:02,760 --> 00:10:05,760
It's not embarrassing.

202
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:08,760
You can say a lot of things without
being embarrassed.

203
00:10:08,760 --> 00:10:11,760
It's all because of Ilmi.

204
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:14,760
It's all because of Ilmi.

205
00:10:14,760 --> 00:10:17,760
It's nice. It looks like it's written on
the poster.

206
00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:22,760
Everyone, please come to Mori no Gawaden
Terrace to play.

207
00:10:22,760 --> 00:10:24,760
Thank you very much.

208
00:10:24,760 --> 00:10:25,760
See you.

209
00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:29,702
See you.
