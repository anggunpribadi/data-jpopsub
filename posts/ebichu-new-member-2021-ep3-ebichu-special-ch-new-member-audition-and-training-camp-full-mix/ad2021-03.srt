I forgot to wear my shoes during the

00:01:16,096 --> 00:01:20,096
I regret that.

22
00:01:21,096 --> 00:01:23,096
I was embarrassed.

23
00:01:24,096 --> 00:01:28,096

I'm worried.

60
00:05:02,970 --> 00:05:11,970
I've been doing ballet for a long time,
so I thought it would be nice if I could
use ballet well.

61
00:05:13,970 --> 00:05:16,970
And among the students...

62
00:05:17,970 --> 00:05:20,970
Do you divide the lines into English and
English?

63
00:05:20,970 --> 00:05:22,970
No, it's the production part.

64

70
00:05:42,336 --> 00:05:43,836
Are you a dancer?

00:05:43,836 --> 00:05:45,336
I am.

72
00:05:45,336 --> 00:05:47,336
What kind of dance do you do?

73
00:05:47,336 --> 00:06:05,336
I do the dance that the teacher made for
me.

74
00:06:05,336 --> 00:06:09,336
I was too nervous earlier that my lungs
were about to break.

75
00:06:09,336 --> 00:06:09,872
Thank you.

76
00:06:09,872 --> 00:06:11,312

77
00:06:11,312 --> 00:06:13,312
I'm 14 years old. 14歳です。

78
00:06:13,312 --> 00:06:14,752
Where do you live? 住まいは?

79
00:06:14,752 --> 00:06:16,752
Akita. 秋田ですよね。

80
00:06:16,752 --> 00:06:18,752
What do you do for a living? 部活は何かやってる?

81
00:06:18,752 --> 00:06:20,752
I'm an actress. 部活は演技部です。

82
00:06:20,752 --> 00:06:32,250
I'm an actor. 感生部長ですよね。

83
00:06:33,130 --> 00:06:49,390
and when I happened to watch anderen

84
00:06:49,390 --> 00:06:55,072
An audition in which sheilaл conference
preparations, while testing her
abilities

85
00:06:55,072 --> 00:07:02,072
Age, affiliation, and birthplace are all
different, but the feelings she has for
Ebichu are all the same.

86
00:07:03,072 --> 00:07:06,072
So, that group has already disappeared?

87
00:07:06,072 --> 00:07:07,072
I graduated.

88
00:07:07,072 --> 00:07:10,072
Oh, you graduated? Why did you graduate?

89
00:07:10,072 --> 00:07:18,072
I knew that there was an audition for
Ebichu, and I've always loved Ebichu
since I was little.

90
00:07:18,072 --> 00:07:28,072
I've always wanted to become an Ebichu
since I was in elementary school, so I
couldn't give up on it, so I graduated
and took this audition.

91
00:07:28,072 --> 00:07:32,624
Oh, that audition. I think it's the best
audition I've ever had.

92
00:07:32,624 --> 00:07:35,264
She wants to achieve her dream.

93
00:07:35,264 --> 00:07:38,364
She's determined to take the audition.

94
00:07:38,364 --> 00:07:41,964
I love Hinata Kashiage.

95
00:07:41,964 --> 00:07:47,464
But since 2013, she's been a great
singer.

96
00:07:47,464 --> 00:07:49,564
I was fascinated by her.

97
00:07:49,564 --> 00:08:04,104
I thought this was my last chance.

98
00:08:04,154 --> 00:08:13,154
Go your own way, no matter what happens

99
00:08:13,154 --> 00:08:18,800
You are you

100
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:28,800
I'm here because I want to be a shrimp.

101
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:34,800
I'm here because I want to be a shrimp.

102
00:08:34,800 --> 00:08:37,800
I was too nervous to be a shrimp.

103
00:08:37,800 --> 00:08:42,800
I'm here because I want to be a shrimp.

104
00:08:42,800 --> 00:08:48,800
I was too nervous to be a shrimp.

105
00:08:48,848 --> 00:08:53,848
How many people will be the final
judges?

106
00:08:54,848 --> 00:09:03,848
