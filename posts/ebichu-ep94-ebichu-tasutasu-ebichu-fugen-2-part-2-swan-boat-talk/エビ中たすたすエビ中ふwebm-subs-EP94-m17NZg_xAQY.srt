1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
This week's Ebichu Tastas is the end of
Fuyuen 2017.

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:11,000
They split into three teams and relax on
the swan boat.

3
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:13,000
Or so it should be.

4
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:16,000
We are the best team.

5
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:20,000
We are the best team.

6
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,000
What is it?

7
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:25,360
Ebichu Tastas, start!

8
00:00:25,360 --> 00:00:27,360
Bonus

9
00:00:37,946 --> 00:00:39,946
I'm so into you that I can't even
breathe

10
00:00:39,946 --> 00:00:44,946
What should I do with my heart that's
filled with tubulin?

11
00:00:45,946 --> 00:00:50,946
Monotrium, monotrium, monotrium, middle
school students

12
00:00:50,946 --> 00:00:54,946
Try adding all kinds of things to your
private Ebisu middle school!

13
00:00:54,946 --> 00:01:02,170
Ebisu Middle School!

14
00:01:02,170 --> 00:01:07,170
This program is brought to you by these
sponsors.

15
00:01:17,402 --> 00:01:24,402
The members enjoyed the Tokyo Doitsumura
so much in the winter festival, Fuyuen.

16
00:01:24,402 --> 00:01:27,402
The sun is about to set.

17
00:01:27,402 --> 00:01:33,402
We've come to the end of the winter
festival in Tokyo Doitsumura.

18
00:01:33,402 --> 00:01:37,402
The sun is about to set and it's getting
cold.

19
00:01:39,402 --> 00:01:42,402
Everything was cold.

20
00:01:42,402 --> 00:01:45,402
Everything was cold, but no one was
cold.

21
00:01:45,402 --> 00:01:48,402
Lastly, it's time for a boat ride.

22
00:01:48,402 --> 00:01:56,402
You can ride a tour boat and talk about
things you don't usually talk about.

23
00:01:56,402 --> 00:01:58,402
You can talk about anything.

24
00:01:58,402 --> 00:02:00,402
Let's go.

25
00:02:00,402 --> 00:02:10,272
The last part of the winter festival is
a relaxing talk with the members.

26
00:02:11,272 --> 00:02:16,272
The last time, Matsuno was absent, so
the members who are on the boat are

27
00:02:17,272 --> 00:02:21,272
the youngest Nakayama and the oldest
Mayama.

28
00:02:22,272 --> 00:02:27,272
Hirota and Hoshina, who formed a unit at
the end of last year's college game.

29
00:02:28,272 --> 00:02:33,272
The last is the three people who look
lively, Yasumoto, Kobayashi, and
Kashiwagi.

30
00:02:33,272 --> 00:02:41,272
Please go!

31
00:02:41,466 --> 00:02:42,928
Let's go

32
00:02:42,928 --> 00:02:47,548
Let's start our relaxing talk time on
the boat.

33
00:02:49,928 --> 00:02:51,228
It's time to relax on the boat.

34
00:02:51,228 --> 00:02:52,728
It's time to relax on the boat.

35
00:02:52,728 --> 00:02:54,548
It's time to relax on the boat.

36
00:02:55,268 --> 00:02:57,808
What are we talking about?

37
00:02:57,808 --> 00:02:59,508
What did we talk about last time?

38
00:02:59,508 --> 00:03:00,508
Last time?

39
00:03:00,508 --> 00:03:03,228
We talked about the hotel.

40
00:03:06,228 --> 00:03:08,348
A year ago,

41
00:03:08,348 --> 00:03:12,348
on the Ferris wheel talk on the boat.

42
00:03:13,592 --> 00:03:15,592
Yasumoto and Kobayashi are...

43
00:03:15,592 --> 00:03:18,592
Funny Soon

44
00:03:18,592 --> 00:03:20,452
Like this.

45
00:03:22,912 --> 00:03:24,912
LOL

46
00:03:24,912 --> 00:03:26,170
Thank you!

47
00:03:26,170 --> 00:03:28,170
I'm tired again.

48
00:03:28,170 --> 00:03:29,170
I'm tired.

49
00:03:30,170 --> 00:03:31,170
Oh, no.

50
00:03:31,170 --> 00:03:32,170
Meanwhile...

51
00:03:32,170 --> 00:03:34,170
I'm hungry.

52
00:03:34,170 --> 00:03:36,170
I'm hungry.

53
00:03:36,170 --> 00:03:37,170
I'm hungry.

54
00:03:37,170 --> 00:03:40,170
We didn't have enough food to cook.

55
00:03:40,170 --> 00:03:42,170
It was delicious.

56
00:03:42,170 --> 00:03:45,170
We should have had more rice.

57
00:03:45,170 --> 00:03:47,170
We didn't have enough time to eat.

58
00:03:48,170 --> 00:03:50,170
I was cooking.

59
00:03:50,170 --> 00:03:52,170
I was grilling the fish.

60
00:03:52,170 --> 00:03:52,864
I'm hungry.

61
00:03:53,864 --> 00:03:56,864
Next, the pair who began the chit-chat
with theداhos,

62
00:03:57,864 --> 00:03:58,864
Pat is saying…

63
00:03:59,864 --> 00:04:01,864
We'll really well in this game!

64
00:04:13,864 --> 00:04:16,864
She clashed the boat of Mayama and
Nakayama.

65
00:04:17,864 --> 00:04:18,864
In addition,

66
00:04:18,864 --> 00:04:20,864
We can move from here

67
00:04:20,864 --> 00:04:24,864
Let's go together

68
00:04:24,864 --> 00:04:26,864
I'll go first

69
00:04:26,864 --> 00:04:28,864
I'll go first

70
00:04:28,864 --> 00:04:30,864
I'll go first

71
00:04:30,864 --> 00:04:32,864
I'll go first

72
00:04:32,864 --> 00:04:34,864
I'm going first

73
00:04:36,864 --> 00:04:38,864
Why are you following me?

74
00:04:38,864 --> 00:04:40,864
I'm going first

75
00:04:40,864 --> 00:04:42,864
I'm going first

76
00:04:42,864 --> 00:04:44,864
What's going on?

77
00:04:44,864 --> 00:04:45,882
I'm going first

78
00:04:45,882 --> 00:04:47,882
Let's do it again

79
00:04:47,882 --> 00:04:48,882
Sorry, I'm so tired

80
00:04:48,882 --> 00:04:49,882
I went the wrong way

81
00:04:49,882 --> 00:04:50,882
Can you do it?

82
00:04:50,882 --> 00:04:51,882
I can

83
00:04:51,882 --> 00:04:52,882
Wait a minute

84
00:05:01,882 --> 00:05:05,882
We are all in the same row

85
00:05:05,882 --> 00:05:10,882
We are all in the same row

86
00:05:14,490 --> 00:05:19,490
Chuu-en, who was looking at the members
who were too free,

87
00:05:19,490 --> 00:05:22,490
Hi, everyone!

88
00:05:22,490 --> 00:05:25,490
Since we're a pair, please let us go.

89
00:05:26,490 --> 00:05:28,490
What are you doing?

90
00:05:29,490 --> 00:05:32,490
It's like a Mercedes logo.

91
00:05:33,490 --> 00:05:38,490
So the three groups were separated and
reunited.

92
00:05:38,490 --> 00:05:40,490
I'm dancing.

93
00:05:40,490 --> 00:05:41,498
I'm dancing.

94
00:05:41,498 --> 00:05:43,498
How was it today?

95
00:05:43,498 --> 00:05:44,498
Today?

96
00:05:44,498 --> 00:05:46,498
Which part was the best?

97
00:05:48,498 --> 00:05:51,498
I think Shibasuri was the best

98
00:05:51,498 --> 00:05:52,498
Shibasuri was the best?

99
00:05:53,498 --> 00:05:54,498
It was so hard to ride

100
00:05:54,498 --> 00:05:58,498
At first, I couldn't ride straight

101
00:05:58,498 --> 00:06:02,498
I started to ride in the back

102
00:06:02,498 --> 00:06:05,498
I thought I would fall down, but I was
able to ride fast

103
00:06:05,498 --> 00:06:07,498
I think it's better to ride in the front

104
00:06:07,498 --> 00:06:11,498
I feel like everyone is here

105
00:06:11,498 --> 00:06:15,498
Mayama and Riko's pair is quite
surprising

106
00:06:15,498 --> 00:06:16,498
It's a strange feeling

107
00:06:17,498 --> 00:06:22,498
This pair is a combination that members
think is rare

108
00:06:22,498 --> 00:06:29,498
What if we add Mayama to M2?

109
00:06:29,498 --> 00:06:30,498
What if we do that?

110
00:06:30,498 --> 00:06:32,498
What do you want to do?

111
00:06:32,498 --> 00:06:33,498
What should we do?

112
00:06:33,498 --> 00:06:37,498
What do you want to do with 8 yen?

113
00:06:37,498 --> 00:06:45,498
We will rent a hotel in Naska and make
something

114
00:06:45,498 --> 00:06:48,498
We will make a message from the ground

115
00:06:52,498 --> 00:06:58,498
We will make a huge domino

116
00:06:58,498 --> 00:07:00,498
I want to do it

117
00:07:00,498 --> 00:07:03,498
I want to do it

118
00:07:03,498 --> 00:07:05,498
It's hard

119
00:07:05,498 --> 00:07:12,752
Please subscribe to our channel!

120
00:07:13,752 --> 00:07:17,752
What do you want to add next?

121
00:07:17,752 --> 00:07:19,752
What do you want to add?

122
00:07:19,752 --> 00:07:22,752
They are also talking about what they
want to add.

123
00:07:22,752 --> 00:07:24,752
I want to add a lot.

124
00:07:24,752 --> 00:07:27,752
I don't know what I want to add.

125
00:07:27,752 --> 00:07:29,752
I don't know.

126
00:07:29,752 --> 00:07:33,752
I want to add a job experience.

127
00:07:33,752 --> 00:07:37,752
I want to go back to the beginning.

128
00:07:37,752 --> 00:07:40,752
I think it's good to go back to the
beginning.

129
00:07:40,752 --> 00:07:46,752
But, I want to add a staff experience.

130
00:07:46,752 --> 00:07:47,752
I don't know.

131
00:07:47,752 --> 00:07:51,752
I want to add it, but I don't usually do
it.

132
00:07:51,752 --> 00:07:55,752
I want to make a video with everyone.

133
00:07:55,752 --> 00:07:57,752
I want to add a live performance.

134
00:07:57,752 --> 00:08:01,752
I want to make a plan for a live
performance.

135
00:08:01,752 --> 00:08:04,752
I want to make a live performance.

136
00:08:04,752 --> 00:08:07,752
We can practice together.

137
00:08:07,752 --> 00:08:09,752
Then, we can make a plan.

138
00:08:09,752 --> 00:08:13,752
We have to do the Moratorium of TAKIUE.

139
00:08:13,752 --> 00:08:17,752
We have to learn the Moratorium of
TAKIUE.

140
00:08:17,752 --> 00:08:21,888
What is the Moratorium of TAKIUE?

141
00:08:22,888 --> 00:08:28,888
In the previous trial, TAKIUE was
accused of being affectionate towards
Ebichu.

142
00:08:28,888 --> 00:08:31,888
He was sentenced to life in prison.

143
00:08:34,888 --> 00:08:36,888
As a result...

144
00:08:36,888 --> 00:08:46,888
TAKIUE will be in prison for a month.

145
00:08:47,098 --> 00:08:51,098
So, if Tastas Live is realized,

146
00:08:51,098 --> 00:08:55,098
Takiue's Cancopy Moratorium Junior High
School may be unveiled.

147
00:08:55,098 --> 00:08:57,098
Isn't it good?

148
00:08:57,098 --> 00:08:58,098
It's good.

149
00:08:58,098 --> 00:09:00,098
The universe plus the doggie world.

150
00:09:00,098 --> 00:09:02,098
Yeah, it's decided.

151
00:09:02,098 --> 00:09:04,098
The universe plus the doggie world.

152
00:09:04,098 --> 00:09:05,098
It's decided.

153
00:09:05,098 --> 00:09:07,098
It will be held in the fall of this
year.

154
00:09:08,098 --> 00:09:12,098
It will be held in the fall of this
year, 2017.

155
00:09:12,098 --> 00:09:15,098
Everyone, look forward to it.

156
00:09:15,098 --> 00:09:17,098
We are waiting for you.

157
00:09:19,472 --> 00:09:23,472
And the one who will take care of the
boat is Tashiwagi.

158
00:09:26,296 --> 00:09:30,296
The driving skill is not good.

159
00:09:30,296 --> 00:09:33,296
I think I will be in trouble if I get in
the car.

160
00:09:34,296 --> 00:09:37,296
Can I get a driver's license?

161
00:09:37,296 --> 00:09:39,296
Yes, you can.

162
00:09:40,296 --> 00:09:42,296
I want to get a driver's license.

163
00:09:43,296 --> 00:09:47,296
I'm worried about the car.

164
00:09:47,296 --> 00:09:49,296
I think it's dangerous.

165
00:09:49,296 --> 00:09:51,296
I will drive.

166
00:09:51,296 --> 00:09:57,296
I have been longing for driving since I
was a child.

167
00:09:57,296 --> 00:09:58,296
You are cool.

168
00:09:58,296 --> 00:10:09,296
I thought that a man should drive.

169
00:10:09,296 --> 00:10:11,296
I have the image of a father.

170
00:10:11,296 --> 00:10:22,296
I thought that it was cool when a woman
drove.

171
00:10:22,296 --> 00:10:27,296
I thought that I would like to drive
when I grow up.

172
00:10:28,296 --> 00:10:32,296
I'm nervous when I get on the boat.

173
00:10:32,296 --> 00:10:40,296
I want to drive with the members.

174
00:10:40,296 --> 00:10:43,296
I want to drive with this camera.

175
00:10:43,296 --> 00:10:46,296
It would be nice if everyone's age
increased.

176
00:10:46,296 --> 00:10:49,296
It may be possible.

177
00:10:50,488 --> 00:10:54,488
Will they be able to drive?

178
00:10:55,488 --> 00:10:56,488
On the other hand...

179
00:10:56,488 --> 00:10:58,488
I'm getting sleepy.

180
00:10:58,488 --> 00:11:01,488
No, you're still working.

181
00:11:01,488 --> 00:11:04,488
You're still working.

182
00:11:04,488 --> 00:11:07,488
You're still working.

183
00:11:11,144 --> 00:11:12,144
What do you want to do?

184
00:11:12,144 --> 00:11:14,144
I want to do something like a
staycation.

185
00:11:14,144 --> 00:11:15,144
That's good.

186
00:11:15,144 --> 00:11:16,144
I went to Eritrea once.

187
00:11:16,144 --> 00:11:23,144
I want to set up a camera in my room and
take a video of us staying there.

188
00:11:23,144 --> 00:11:25,144
That sounds fun.

189
00:11:25,144 --> 00:11:30,144
We can share a house.

190
00:11:30,144 --> 00:11:32,144
I want to stay at someone's house.

191
00:11:32,144 --> 00:11:33,144
That's good.

192
00:11:33,144 --> 00:11:34,144
I want you to stay at my house.

193
00:11:34,144 --> 00:11:35,144
I want to.

194
00:11:35,144 --> 00:11:40,144
I haven't called you yet.

195
00:11:40,144 --> 00:11:42,144
I might be a little late.

196
00:11:42,144 --> 00:11:43,144
I'm not sure.

197
00:11:43,144 --> 00:11:44,144
OK.

198
00:11:44,144 --> 00:11:46,144
I'm going.

199
00:11:46,144 --> 00:11:48,144
That's good.

200
00:11:48,144 --> 00:11:54,144
It's not like we're all together all
day.

201
00:11:54,144 --> 00:11:56,144
We say goodbye halfway.

202
00:11:56,144 --> 00:11:57,144
We go home.

203
00:11:57,144 --> 00:12:01,144
I wonder what it's like to be together
all day.

204
00:12:01,144 --> 00:12:06,144
It must be fun to be with people who are
sick.

205
00:12:06,144 --> 00:12:10,144
It's hard to be sick.

206
00:12:10,144 --> 00:12:12,144
I have a bad sleeping habit.

207
00:12:12,144 --> 00:12:15,144
I have a bad sleeping habit.

208
00:12:15,144 --> 00:12:18,144
While they're talking about the
staycation,

209
00:12:18,144 --> 00:12:24,144
they're talking about when Kashiwagi and
Yasumoto shared a room at the hotel.

210
00:12:24,144 --> 00:12:27,144
I had a sexy pose once.

211
00:12:27,144 --> 00:12:28,144
Really?

212
00:12:28,144 --> 00:12:30,144
I was like this.

213
00:12:30,144 --> 00:12:35,144
I think it was the first time we shared
a room.

214
00:12:35,144 --> 00:12:43,144
I was told that I had a bad sleeping
habit.

215
00:12:43,144 --> 00:12:47,144
But we couldn't sleep in the same bed.

216
00:12:47,144 --> 00:12:50,144
I was like, I'm fine.

217
00:12:50,144 --> 00:12:52,144
I didn't have a bad sleeping habit.

218
00:12:52,144 --> 00:12:56,144
Aya and I sleep until the last minute.

219
00:12:56,144 --> 00:12:59,144
I wake up early.

220
00:12:59,144 --> 00:13:09,144
I look at the wall and my legs are up.

221
00:13:09,144 --> 00:13:16,144
I put my hands on my head and it feels
good.

222
00:13:16,144 --> 00:13:18,144
That's amazing.

223
00:13:18,144 --> 00:13:23,144
I want to put my hands under the
macaroon.

224
00:13:23,144 --> 00:13:26,144
I put my hands under the macaroon.

225
00:13:26,144 --> 00:13:32,144
It's warm and comfortable when I put my
hands under the macaroon.

226
00:13:32,144 --> 00:13:38,144
I used to have a bad sleeping habit.

227
00:13:38,144 --> 00:13:42,144
I used to fall down and my bed was torn.

228
00:13:42,144 --> 00:13:47,144
I used to sleep with my face up.

229
00:13:47,144 --> 00:13:52,144
But I've been sleeping with my face down
for about half a year.

230
00:13:52,144 --> 00:13:54,144
I'm sure I'll get sick.

231
00:13:54,144 --> 00:13:59,144
I'm not a sick person.

232
00:13:59,144 --> 00:14:03,144
I don't think I'll get sick when I wake
up.

233
00:14:03,144 --> 00:14:06,144
I sometimes sleep like a crushed frog.

234
00:14:06,144 --> 00:14:08,144
I do.

235
00:14:08,144 --> 00:14:10,144
I do sometimes.

236
00:14:10,144 --> 00:14:14,144
The three are excited about the story of
sleeping habits.

237
00:14:14,144 --> 00:14:20,144
Hoshina and Hirota are talking about the
live performance this month.

238
00:14:20,144 --> 00:14:23,120
It's not me. It's Taekwon Live.

239
00:14:24,120 --> 00:14:29,120
Ebichu has been participating in Taiwan
festivals for two consecutive years.

240
00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:32,120
This year, they will hold their first
one-man live.

241
00:14:32,120 --> 00:14:34,120
I've never been to Taiwan.

242
00:14:34,120 --> 00:14:36,120
It's the first time, and it's warm.

243
00:14:36,120 --> 00:14:38,120
But it's colder than here.

244
00:14:38,120 --> 00:14:41,120
It's warm. It's easy to live.

245
00:14:42,120 --> 00:14:45,120
Ko-chan said she wanted to participate
in Taiwan's Sudden Death.

246
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:46,120
I said that.

247
00:14:46,120 --> 00:14:49,120
I really like Sudden Death.

248
00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:51,120
I think it's a great song.

249
00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:55,120
I'm glad that we can do another exciting
song like that.

250
00:14:55,120 --> 00:14:58,120
I think it's going to be a great song.

251
00:14:58,120 --> 00:15:01,120
I'm looking forward to the live
performance.

252
00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:03,120
I really like Sudden Death.

253
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:08,120
I want to do a live performance of the
real-time version of Sudden Death.

254
00:15:08,120 --> 00:15:15,120
At the end, when there are two people
left, I want to revive the loser.

255
00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:17,120
Revival

256
00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:22,120
If I revive, I'll be a loser.

257
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:25,120
And these two people.

258
00:15:25,120 --> 00:15:29,120
The spring tour was very...

259
00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:33,120
The spring tour last year left a lot of
challenges.

260
00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:35,120
I'm a college student.

261
00:15:35,120 --> 00:15:38,120
So I want to do my best.

262
00:15:38,120 --> 00:15:42,120
There are many places this time, and
there are places for the first time.

263
00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:46,120
I'm glad that Riko-chan talked to me a
lot like this.

264
00:15:46,120 --> 00:15:48,120
Thank you.

265
00:15:48,120 --> 00:15:49,120
Thank you.

266
00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:52,688
Thank you.

267
00:15:53,688 --> 00:15:56,688
In this way, the peaceful time goes by
slowly.

268
00:15:56,688 --> 00:16:00,688
Swan boat time is over.

269
00:16:03,752 --> 00:16:06,752
What are these three talking about?

270
00:16:06,752 --> 00:16:08,752
TASU TASU

271
00:16:08,752 --> 00:16:11,752
What do you want to do?

272
00:16:11,752 --> 00:16:12,752
What about this pair?

273
00:16:12,752 --> 00:16:14,752
TASU TASU

274
00:16:14,752 --> 00:16:16,752
What do you want to add?

275
00:16:16,752 --> 00:16:18,752
The topic is the same

276
00:16:18,752 --> 00:16:22,752
And, Mayama and Takayama

277
00:16:23,264 --> 00:16:25,264
Did you guys fight?

278
00:16:25,264 --> 00:16:27,264
No, we didn't

279
00:16:27,264 --> 00:16:29,264
It's getting cold. Are you ok to talk to
us?

280
00:16:29,264 --> 00:16:31,264
Are you ok?

281
00:16:31,264 --> 00:16:33,264
We want to add something

282
00:16:33,264 --> 00:16:35,264
Really?

283
00:16:35,264 --> 00:16:37,264
We are not all here, but we are all here

284
00:16:37,264 --> 00:16:39,264
This is all on air

285
00:16:39,264 --> 00:16:41,264
Look at this, everyone

286
00:16:41,264 --> 00:16:43,264
The illumination

287
00:16:43,264 --> 00:16:45,264
Let's go home

288
00:16:45,264 --> 00:16:47,264
No, we can't

289
00:16:47,264 --> 00:16:49,264
We can't go home

290
00:16:49,264 --> 00:16:51,264
This episode will end when it gets
beautiful

291
00:16:51,264 --> 00:16:53,264
We will go home

292
00:16:53,264 --> 00:16:55,264
After this

293
00:16:55,264 --> 00:16:57,264
Members are screaming

294
00:16:57,264 --> 00:16:59,264
That episode will be

295
00:16:59,264 --> 00:17:01,264
Bring the ladder

296
00:17:01,264 --> 00:17:03,264
We can't go home

297
00:17:04,408 --> 00:17:06,408
They enjoyed the winter park

298
00:17:06,408 --> 00:17:11,408
While they were enjoying the park, a
member was called to a certain venue

299
00:17:12,408 --> 00:17:14,408
Come in

300
00:17:15,408 --> 00:17:17,408
What are you doing? You're late

301
00:17:18,408 --> 00:17:20,408
You're late

302
00:17:20,408 --> 00:17:22,408
Why are you guys late?

303
00:17:23,408 --> 00:17:27,408
The hellish plan was waiting for them

304
00:17:27,408 --> 00:17:29,408
To be continued

305
00:17:30,680 --> 00:17:32,680
Hashiraya-san, you look a little funny
now

306
00:17:32,680 --> 00:17:34,680
What's wrong?

307
00:17:36,680 --> 00:17:38,680
Don't worry!

308
00:17:38,680 --> 00:17:40,680
Take it!

309
00:17:40,680 --> 00:17:42,680
Take it!

310
00:17:42,680 --> 00:17:45,760
Thank you for watching!

311
00:17:45,760 --> 00:17:47,760
Bring the money!

312
00:17:49,760 --> 00:17:50,760
What's your name?

313
00:17:50,760 --> 00:17:51,760
When did you start?

314
00:17:52,760 --> 00:17:53,760
I'm not sure...

315
00:17:55,760 --> 00:17:56,760
Who are you?

316
00:17:56,760 --> 00:17:58,760
I'm Hayashi Choichoyamon.

317
00:17:59,760 --> 00:18:04,760
We're going to start the second entrance
exam for Shiritsu University.

318
00:18:07,760 --> 00:18:09,760
We did this before.

319
00:18:09,760 --> 00:18:11,760
Do you remember the goal?

320
00:18:11,760 --> 00:18:15,760
If you get 1% correct, you get 99% of
the prize.

321
00:18:15,760 --> 00:18:17,760
Do you remember this?

322
00:18:17,760 --> 00:18:19,760
What's this stupid thing?

323
00:18:19,760 --> 00:18:20,760
It's you!

324
00:18:20,760 --> 00:18:21,760
It's your answer!

325
00:18:25,760 --> 00:18:26,760
Wait, what?

326
00:18:26,760 --> 00:18:28,352
Let's do it again!

327
00:18:29,352 --> 00:18:30,352
Wow!

328
00:18:32,352 --> 00:18:35,352
The entrance exam season has come again
this year!

329
00:18:35,352 --> 00:18:38,352
So, the entrance exam for Ebi University
is held urgently.

330
00:18:40,352 --> 00:18:42,352
How good are their academic abilities?

331
00:18:43,352 --> 00:18:46,352
A year ago, they took the test for the
exams.

332
00:18:48,352 --> 00:18:51,352
The question that determines the growth
of the frog is...

333
00:18:51,352 --> 00:18:53,352
The pearl has appeared.

334
00:18:53,352 --> 00:18:57,352
The result is 1% of flounder and 99%
of...

335
00:18:57,352 --> 00:18:58,352
...pearl!

336
00:18:59,352 --> 00:19:01,352
They got the same answer twice.

337
00:19:01,352 --> 00:19:06,240
They couldn't measure their academic
abilities properly.

338
00:19:07,240 --> 00:19:11,240
How much have they improved in the past
year?

339
00:19:11,240 --> 00:19:13,240
Let's start the exam!

340
00:19:14,240 --> 00:19:18,240
Everyone, this is the second entrance
exam for Shigetsu Ebisu University.

341
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:20,240
You have 10 points for each question.

342
00:19:20,240 --> 00:19:24,240
If you get 80 points, you pass.

343
00:19:24,240 --> 00:19:30,128
You have earned a reward.

344
00:19:31,128 --> 00:19:36,128
This is the most popular menu of Madame
Shrimp, a Ginza restaurant specializing
in shrimp dishes.

345
00:19:37,128 --> 00:19:38,128
It's a high-class shrimp cutlet
sandwich.

346
00:19:39,128 --> 00:19:40,128
It's 1,600 yen per piece.

347
00:19:42,128 --> 00:19:43,128
It's a good price.

348
00:19:45,128 --> 00:19:50,128
The person with the lowest score will be
given a special treatment to improve
their brain.

349
00:19:52,128 --> 00:19:54,128
Everyone, do your best.

350
00:19:55,128 --> 00:19:56,128
Is it okay to raise the ladder?

351
00:19:56,128 --> 00:19:57,128
You're going to give a difficult
question, right?

352
00:19:59,128 --> 00:20:00,128
A ladder game.

353
00:20:01,128 --> 00:20:02,128
I'm going to give a difficult question.

354
00:20:03,128 --> 00:20:05,128
What should I do if I want to make this
a dog?

355
00:20:06,128 --> 00:20:07,128
Put a pen on the right.

356
00:20:08,128 --> 00:20:09,128
Yes, genius.

357
00:20:10,128 --> 00:20:11,128
As expected, you are a ladder game.

358
00:20:12,128 --> 00:20:13,128
You can do it if you do it.

359
00:20:14,128 --> 00:20:18,128
The shrimp entrance exam has started
with the switch of the ladder game.

360
00:20:19,128 --> 00:20:20,128
The first question is a national
language.

361
00:20:22,128 --> 00:20:23,128
The first question is this.

362
00:20:23,128 --> 00:20:24,128
No.

363
00:20:25,128 --> 00:20:27,128
Describe a beautiful landscape in four
letters.

364
00:20:28,128 --> 00:20:29,128
Five.

365
00:20:29,128 --> 00:20:30,128
Flower.

366
00:20:30,128 --> 00:20:31,128
Wind.

367
00:20:32,128 --> 00:20:33,128
Please write the letters in between.

368
00:20:34,128 --> 00:20:35,128
I forgot.

369
00:20:35,128 --> 00:20:40,496
If you are Japanese, you know this.

370
00:20:41,496 --> 00:20:42,996
Hurry up.

371
00:20:42,996 --> 00:20:44,996
This is easy.

372
00:20:44,996 --> 00:20:47,996
The first one is a hand-waving game.

373
00:20:48,996 --> 00:20:52,996
The correct answer is a bird and a tree.

374
00:20:52,996 --> 00:20:57,712
What is the answer to the question of
common sense?

375
00:20:58,712 --> 00:20:59,712
Ok, everyone has written down the answer

376
00:20:59,712 --> 00:21:00,712
Yes

377
00:21:00,712 --> 00:21:01,712
Yasumoto

378
00:21:01,712 --> 00:21:02,712
Yes

379
00:21:02,712 --> 00:21:03,712
Volcanic Balloon

380
00:21:03,712 --> 00:21:04,712
Volcanic Balloon

381
00:21:04,712 --> 00:21:05,712
I see

382
00:21:05,712 --> 00:21:06,712
Volcanic Balloon

383
00:21:06,712 --> 00:21:07,712
What does it mean?

384
00:21:07,712 --> 00:21:10,712
It represents nature

385
00:21:10,712 --> 00:21:14,712
Beautiful things, flowers, mountains,
wind, river

386
00:21:14,712 --> 00:21:16,712
Japanese wind

387
00:21:16,712 --> 00:21:18,712
It's good to read the river as a line

388
00:21:18,712 --> 00:21:20,712
It means the line of the dragon

389
00:21:20,712 --> 00:21:21,712
That's right

390
00:21:22,712 --> 00:21:24,712
Next, Nakayama-san, please

391
00:21:24,712 --> 00:21:28,712
The name is like a flower

392
00:21:28,712 --> 00:21:29,712
Flower?

393
00:21:31,712 --> 00:21:33,712
You are a singer song writer

394
00:21:33,712 --> 00:21:34,712
Flower

395
00:21:34,712 --> 00:21:35,712
Flower

396
00:21:35,712 --> 00:21:37,712
It means the wind

397
00:21:37,712 --> 00:21:38,712
Flowers

398
00:21:38,712 --> 00:21:40,712
Beautiful

399
00:21:40,712 --> 00:21:43,712
Did you make it up by yourself?

400
00:21:43,712 --> 00:21:46,712
Yasumoto-san explained it for some
reason

401
00:21:46,712 --> 00:21:50,712
Ok, Hoshina-san and Mayama-san

402
00:21:50,712 --> 00:21:52,712
Please give us the answer

403
00:21:52,712 --> 00:21:54,712
This one

404
00:21:54,712 --> 00:21:55,712
Kachou Fugetsu

405
00:21:55,712 --> 00:21:56,712
Correct

406
00:21:56,712 --> 00:21:57,712
Congratulations

407
00:21:57,712 --> 00:21:58,712
Ok, I'll turn it over

408
00:21:58,712 --> 00:21:59,712
Here we go

409
00:21:59,712 --> 00:22:02,712
Kachou Fugetsu

410
00:22:04,712 --> 00:22:06,712
It's like a flower, isn't it?

411
00:22:08,712 --> 00:22:11,712
The remaining three answers are as you
can see

412
00:22:11,712 --> 00:22:14,712
Unfortunately, they are not correct

413
00:22:14,712 --> 00:22:18,672
Next, the second question

414
00:22:18,672 --> 00:22:20,352
Good for you

415
00:22:21,384 --> 00:22:23,884
The feeling of being surprised by
something strange

416
00:22:23,884 --> 00:22:25,884
I'm going to play with my belly button

417
00:22:25,884 --> 00:22:27,384
I don't know

418
00:22:27,384 --> 00:22:29,384
That's good, this is an easy one

419
00:22:29,384 --> 00:22:30,384
I can expect this

420
00:22:30,384 --> 00:22:31,384
That's good

421
00:22:31,384 --> 00:22:33,384
I'm worried about the kanji

422
00:22:33,384 --> 00:22:35,384
I don't know at all

423
00:22:35,384 --> 00:22:37,384
If you cheat, you'll die

424
00:22:37,384 --> 00:22:38,384
I don't know

425
00:22:38,384 --> 00:22:40,384
You'll die, so be careful

426
00:22:41,384 --> 00:22:43,384
This is also a service question

427
00:22:43,384 --> 00:22:46,384
The answer is to boil tea with your
belly button

428
00:22:46,384 --> 00:22:50,384
What does the shrimp do with its belly
button?

429
00:22:52,120 --> 00:22:55,120
Let's start with Hirota.

430
00:22:55,120 --> 00:22:57,120
Hirota, what's the strangest thing you
can't get enough of?

431
00:22:57,120 --> 00:22:59,120
Looking at it with your navel.

432
00:22:59,120 --> 00:23:00,120
I see.

433
00:23:00,120 --> 00:23:01,120
Looking at it with your navel?

434
00:23:01,120 --> 00:23:02,120
You look at it here?

435
00:23:02,120 --> 00:23:04,120
Looking at it with my navel.

436
00:23:04,120 --> 00:23:07,120
When it's really bad, I look up so I
can't see it.

437
00:23:07,120 --> 00:23:10,120
Your answer is bad.

438
00:23:11,120 --> 00:23:12,120
And Mayaba.

439
00:23:12,120 --> 00:23:13,120
Yes.

440
00:23:13,120 --> 00:23:15,120
Looking at it with my navel.

441
00:23:15,120 --> 00:23:16,120
Looking at it with your navel?

442
00:23:16,120 --> 00:23:17,120
What does that mean?

443
00:23:17,120 --> 00:23:20,120
When I do muscle training, I'm often
told to look at it with my navel.

444
00:23:20,120 --> 00:23:22,120
It has nothing to do with muscle
training.

445
00:23:22,120 --> 00:23:24,120
But when you're laughing, you look at it
like this.

446
00:23:24,120 --> 00:23:25,120
Yes.

447
00:23:25,120 --> 00:23:26,120
It's strange.

448
00:23:26,120 --> 00:23:27,120
You can't get enough of it.

449
00:23:27,120 --> 00:23:28,120
I see.

450
00:23:28,120 --> 00:23:30,120
And let's look at Nakayama.

451
00:23:30,120 --> 00:23:32,120
Nakayama, here.

452
00:23:32,120 --> 00:23:34,120
I stop laughing with my navel.

453
00:23:34,120 --> 00:23:35,120
You stop laughing with your navel.

454
00:23:35,120 --> 00:23:37,120
You stop laughing with your navel.

455
00:23:37,120 --> 00:23:38,120
I see.

456
00:23:38,120 --> 00:23:40,120
Kashiwagi, you wrote it first.

457
00:23:40,120 --> 00:23:41,120
It was fast.

458
00:23:41,120 --> 00:23:42,120
Kashiwagi, let's go.

459
00:23:42,120 --> 00:23:43,120
Yes.

460
00:23:43,120 --> 00:23:44,120
I dance with my navel.

461
00:23:44,120 --> 00:23:45,120
You dance with your navel.

462
00:23:45,120 --> 00:23:47,120
You dance with your navel.

463
00:23:47,120 --> 00:23:48,120
I dance with my navel.

464
00:23:48,120 --> 00:23:49,120
I see.

465
00:23:49,120 --> 00:23:50,120
It's strange.

466
00:23:50,120 --> 00:23:51,120
It's strange.

467
00:23:51,120 --> 00:23:53,120
Kobayashi, let's go.

468
00:23:53,120 --> 00:23:54,120
I make tea with my navel.

469
00:23:54,120 --> 00:23:55,120
That's correct.

470
00:23:55,120 --> 00:23:56,120
Yasumoto.

471
00:23:56,120 --> 00:23:57,120
Why?

472
00:23:57,120 --> 00:23:58,120
I make tea with my navel.

473
00:23:58,120 --> 00:24:03,120
Following Kobayashi, Yasumoto is also
correct.

474
00:24:03,120 --> 00:24:04,120
Wait a minute.

475
00:24:04,120 --> 00:24:05,120
Challenge time.

476
00:24:05,120 --> 00:24:07,120
You don't need this, do you?

477
00:24:07,120 --> 00:24:08,120
Is this all you need?

478
00:24:08,120 --> 00:24:09,120
Yes, that's all you need.

479
00:24:09,120 --> 00:24:13,120
Well, there's also a question mark,
which is the lower bracket.

480
00:24:13,120 --> 00:24:14,120
They're all wrong.

481
00:24:14,120 --> 00:24:15,120
It's true.

482
00:24:15,120 --> 00:24:17,120
Challenge time.

483
00:24:17,120 --> 00:24:22,120
It's not a big cut, so Kobayashi is
wrong.

484
00:24:22,120 --> 00:24:25,120
It's a big struggle from the beginning.

485
00:24:25,120 --> 00:24:30,120
Last time, Kashiwagi was also
successfully passed the zero-point test.

486
00:24:30,120 --> 00:24:34,544
Who will pass the test?

487
00:24:35,544 --> 00:24:38,544
Next time, more questions will be added!

488
00:24:38,544 --> 00:24:42,544
Think of a sentence using the word, Todo
no Tsumari.

489
00:24:42,544 --> 00:24:45,544
Todo no Tsumari is the meaning of the
show's opening!

490
00:24:45,544 --> 00:24:47,544
Oh, Todo is clogged.

491
00:24:49,544 --> 00:24:52,544
A shocking test of 1 game!

492
00:24:52,544 --> 00:25:05,544
To be continued...

493
00:25:05,914 --> 00:25:06,914
I wonder what it is.

494
00:25:06,914 --> 00:25:07,914
He's preparing.

495
00:25:07,914 --> 00:25:08,914
I can see it.

496
00:25:10,914 --> 00:25:11,914
What is it?

497
00:25:11,914 --> 00:25:13,914
Is alcohol a person with a bad temper?

498
00:25:13,914 --> 00:25:16,973
I think he changes his hairstyle
depending on the season.
