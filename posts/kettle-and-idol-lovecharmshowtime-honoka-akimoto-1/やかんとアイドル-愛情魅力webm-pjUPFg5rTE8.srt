1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,680
I graduated from university,

2
00:00:02,680 --> 00:00:04,680
but I love boy manga,

3
00:00:04,680 --> 00:00:07,480
so I wrote my thesis in Jump.

4
00:00:07,480 --> 00:00:08,680
What?

5
00:00:08,680 --> 00:00:11,680
What's going on?

6
00:00:11,680 --> 00:00:13,680
It's a fast-paced manga,

7
00:00:13,680 --> 00:00:18,080
so I think I'm a genius at packaging.

8
00:00:18,080 --> 00:00:21,880
Akagi-san is the one who comes up with
the packaging for convenience stores.

9
00:00:21,880 --> 00:00:23,400
I was like,

10
00:00:23,400 --> 00:00:25,680
I can do a full marathon, right?

11
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:26,680
You're lying!

12
00:00:26,680 --> 00:00:28,280
I'm serious!

13
00:00:28,280 --> 00:00:30,280
I'm serious!

14
00:00:30,976 --> 00:00:32,976
Niko's Dorm Life

15
00:00:34,280 --> 00:00:40,280
I'm Yakan, born in Miba and raised in
the old school room of Stardust.

16
00:00:40,280 --> 00:00:43,280
And today's guest is this person.

17
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:45,280
Hello!

18
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:49,280
I'm Kimoto Honoka, the leader of Team
Shachi,

19
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:53,280
from Nagoya, where Super Town, Strong
Energy, and Positive Exciting Soul come
from.

20
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:55,280
Nice to meet you.

21
00:00:55,280 --> 00:00:57,280
Nice to meet you, too.

22
00:00:57,280 --> 00:00:58,280
Nice to meet you, too.

23
00:00:58,280 --> 00:00:59,280
I'm Yakan.

24
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:03,280
Finally, Team Shachi is here!

25
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:04,280
Thank you for having me.

26
00:01:04,280 --> 00:01:06,280
Thank you.

27
00:01:06,280 --> 00:01:09,280
It's Team Shachi's 10th anniversary this
year!

28
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:11,280
That's right.

29
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:12,280
It's our 10th anniversary.

30
00:01:12,280 --> 00:01:17,280
It's been 10 years since Team Shachi was
formed.

31
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:21,280
I'm going to keep doing this with a
happy heart.

32
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:25,280
What kind of position do you have,
Kimoto?

33
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:27,280
Me?

34
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:32,280
I've been doing a lot of voice work
since I was a trainee.

35
00:01:32,280 --> 00:01:44,280
I used to think that my voice would ruin
the world view of the song.

36
00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:50,280
But I've been told by everyone that I
should keep my voice alive.

37
00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:54,280
I've been given a lot of voice work over
the past 10 years.

38
00:01:54,280 --> 00:01:58,280
That's right. I've been given a lot of
voice work.

39
00:01:58,280 --> 00:02:01,280
This is an absolute weapon.

40
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:03,280
It's something that people don't have.

41
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:04,280
Thank you.

42
00:02:04,280 --> 00:02:06,280
Are you a voice actor?

43
00:02:06,280 --> 00:02:20,280
I'm a voice actor, a character, a
program narration, and a host of the
Tokyo National Museum's escape game.

44
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:24,280
Are you the one who's going to tell the
story?

45
00:02:24,280 --> 00:02:28,280
That's right. I'm escaping with my
voice.

46
00:02:28,280 --> 00:02:30,280
Are you doing it at the National Museum?

47
00:02:30,280 --> 00:02:31,280
That's right.

48
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:32,280
That's amazing.

49
00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:33,280
Thank you.

50
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:36,280
You're a country-wide expert.

51
00:02:36,280 --> 00:02:40,280
I was surprised, too. I'm glad.

52
00:02:40,280 --> 00:02:48,280
The biggest thing for the team was the
acquisition of a dish label.

53
00:02:48,280 --> 00:02:55,280
We've been taking care of Warner Music
Japan for nine years since we were
first.

54
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:57,280
We've been taking care of them for a
long time.

55
00:02:57,280 --> 00:03:08,280
We've been taking care of them for a
long time.

56
00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:24,280
We've been working on a new dish label
since the time of the 20th anniversary.

57
00:03:24,280 --> 00:03:27,280
It's called Wakuwaku Records.

58
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:38,280
It hasn't changed much since the
customers. When we decided on a new
song, we asked them to listen to the
compilation.

59
00:03:38,280 --> 00:03:50,280
We talked about which song would be good
and decided on a song.

60
00:03:50,280 --> 00:04:00,280
We have a lot of opinions on the new EP
that will be released on November 23rd.

61
00:04:03,464 --> 00:04:05,464
I just heard the title of the song.

62
00:04:05,464 --> 00:04:07,464
The title is...

63
00:04:07,464 --> 00:04:13,464
When we peak at the top of the world, we
break through all the peaks.

64
00:04:14,464 --> 00:04:17,464
I made a mistake. Please say it again.

65
00:04:17,464 --> 00:04:20,464
I'm not used to saying this. I'll say it
again.

66
00:04:20,464 --> 00:04:22,160
Let's say this properly.

67
00:04:23,160 --> 00:04:25,160
The title of the new EP is...

68
00:04:25,160 --> 00:04:32,160
When we reach the top, we will overcome
all difficulties.

69
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:36,160
What kind of thoughts are you talking
about?

70
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:37,160
Are you talking about the members?

71
00:04:37,160 --> 00:04:38,160
That's right.

72
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:43,160
We've been a band since we were in the
president's time.

73
00:04:43,160 --> 00:04:48,160
We think we're a live band.

74
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:57,160
The characteristics of a live band are
that we, not only ourselves, but also
the fans, dance together.

75
00:04:57,160 --> 00:05:04,160
When we reach the top, we will overcome
all difficulties.

76
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:07,160
That's the title of the new EP.

77
00:05:07,160 --> 00:05:10,560
It's like a concept.

78
00:05:11,560 --> 00:05:16,560
I want to know the definition of a manga
that sells well.

79
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:21,560
I actually went to the publisher to get
an appointment and listen to the story.

80
00:05:25,560 --> 00:05:27,560
This program is

81
00:05:27,560 --> 00:05:29,560
Toshi-san

82
00:05:31,560 --> 00:05:33,560
Mac-san

83
00:05:33,560 --> 00:05:37,560
Saki-san

84
00:05:38,362 --> 00:05:40,362
Nickname Nashi-san

85
00:05:42,362 --> 00:05:44,362
Bakaba Gakure no Sato-san

86
00:05:44,362 --> 00:05:47,362
I sent it with a gift

87
00:05:48,362 --> 00:05:50,362
Today's recommended ice cream is

88
00:05:50,362 --> 00:05:52,801
Mina!
