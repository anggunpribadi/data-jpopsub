1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,760
Ebitune's videos

2
00:00:06,074 --> 00:00:12,074
It's been a month since we announced the
new member audition.

3
00:00:12,074 --> 00:00:20,074
We haven't had a chance to talk about
the new member audition like this.

4
00:00:20,074 --> 00:00:37,074
We would like to share the news about
the new member audition.

5
00:00:37,074 --> 00:00:41,074
It's been a month since we announced the
new member audition.

6
00:00:41,074 --> 00:00:51,074
We don't know how many members are in
the audition.

7
00:00:51,074 --> 00:00:53,074
We don't know yet.

8
00:00:53,074 --> 00:00:59,074
I'm so excited.

9
00:00:59,074 --> 00:01:14,074
Mayama was in the audition before the
Ebitune.

10
00:01:14,074 --> 00:01:20,074
It's the first time for someone to be in
the audition.

11
00:01:20,074 --> 00:01:30,074
We were in the same group as the
previous members.

12
00:01:30,074 --> 00:01:40,074
We were in the same group as the
previous members.

13
00:01:40,074 --> 00:01:50,074
We were in the same group as the
previous members.

14
00:01:50,074 --> 00:02:08,074
We didn't think we could grow as a
group.

15
00:02:08,074 --> 00:02:12,074
What is Stardust?

16
00:02:12,074 --> 00:02:15,074
We are at home.

17
00:02:15,074 --> 00:02:22,074
We didn't have a chance to work together
before.

18
00:02:22,074 --> 00:02:31,074
But we have been working together
several times a year.

19
00:02:31,074 --> 00:02:34,074
We are at home.

20
00:02:34,074 --> 00:02:44,074
I don't feel like the president of the
company.

21
00:02:44,074 --> 00:02:47,074
But we have been working together since
we met.

22
00:02:47,074 --> 00:02:54,074
We have never met before.

23
00:02:54,074 --> 00:03:00,074
We are all friendly.

24
00:03:00,074 --> 00:03:12,074
We are young and we can talk to each
other.

25
00:03:12,074 --> 00:03:24,074
When I was in the audition, I thought
everything was strict.

26
00:03:24,074 --> 00:03:32,074
But I was wrong.

27
00:03:32,074 --> 00:03:44,074
We can talk to each other.

28
00:03:44,074 --> 00:03:52,074
We can talk to each other.

29
00:03:52,074 --> 00:03:56,074
We don't have a rule.

30
00:03:56,074 --> 00:04:02,074
We have our own opinions.

31
00:04:02,074 --> 00:04:07,074
We are a flexible company.

32
00:04:07,074 --> 00:04:14,074
We have many tours.

33
00:04:14,074 --> 00:04:23,074
We have many tours.

34
00:04:23,074 --> 00:04:35,074
We are happy to meet our fans.

35
00:04:35,074 --> 00:04:45,074
We have different atmosphere depending
on the place.

36
00:04:45,074 --> 00:04:49,074
We have different way of meeting.

37
00:04:49,074 --> 00:05:09,074
We have many fans who are waiting for
us.

38
00:05:09,074 --> 00:05:22,074
We are happy to meet our fans.

39
00:05:22,074 --> 00:05:32,074
We had a lot of fun on the plane.

40
00:05:32,074 --> 00:05:40,074
We were happy when we went to Osaka for
the first time.

41
00:05:40,074 --> 00:05:55,074
We were happy because we could eat ice
cream on the Shinkansen.

42
00:05:55,074 --> 00:06:05,074
We were happy because we could eat ice
cream on the Shinkansen.

43
00:06:05,074 --> 00:06:16,074
We were happy because we could eat ice
cream on the Shinkansen.

44
00:06:16,074 --> 00:06:28,074
We went to many places for the first
time.

45
00:06:28,074 --> 00:06:39,074
We went to many places for the first
time.

46
00:06:39,074 --> 00:06:51,074
We bought a guitar.

47
00:06:51,074 --> 00:07:02,074
We bought a deck brush.

48
00:07:02,074 --> 00:07:12,074
We bought a black tire.

49
00:07:12,074 --> 00:07:22,074
We were asked what it was.

50
00:07:22,074 --> 00:07:32,074
We were asked what it was.

51
00:07:32,074 --> 00:07:42,074
We were asked what it was.

52
00:07:42,074 --> 00:07:52,074
We were asked what it was.

53
00:07:52,074 --> 00:07:56,880
We were asked what it was.

54
00:07:56,880 --> 00:07:58,880
I want to go.

55
00:07:58,880 --> 00:08:04,880
I hope we can go around the country
again soon.

56
00:08:04,880 --> 00:08:08,880
I want to conquer the 47 prefectures.

57
00:08:08,880 --> 00:08:10,880
That's a dream.

58
00:08:10,880 --> 00:08:16,880
I want to go around with the new
members.

59
00:08:16,880 --> 00:08:28,880
Our voice trainer, Emiko, is always
thinking about the training we need.

60
00:08:28,880 --> 00:08:31,880
There are many patterns.

61
00:08:31,880 --> 00:08:33,880
We don't always do the same thing.

62
00:08:33,880 --> 00:08:37,880
We do what we need to do.

63
00:08:37,880 --> 00:08:39,880
We have two days of live performances.

64
00:08:39,880 --> 00:08:43,880
We do it on the first day.

65
00:08:43,880 --> 00:08:54,880
On the second day, we do it to get rid
of the tiredness.

66
00:08:54,880 --> 00:09:00,880
We check our condition.

67
00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:03,880
We also talk about our training.

68
00:09:03,880 --> 00:09:08,880
We talk about our training.

69
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:10,880
It's fun.

70
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:15,880
We take care of our body and mind.

71
00:09:15,880 --> 00:09:18,880
We also do voice training.

72
00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:20,880
We do our best.

73
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:22,880
It's not limited to voice training.

74
00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:28,880
We are blessed by the teachers.

75
00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:31,880
We are blessed by the teachers.

76
00:09:31,880 --> 00:09:34,880
We are blessed by the teachers.

77
00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:43,880
We only had a manager at first.

78
00:09:43,880 --> 00:09:52,880
We couldn't talk to the girls in junior
high school.

79
00:09:52,880 --> 00:09:56,880
It was difficult to talk to adults.

80
00:09:56,880 --> 00:10:04,880
But the teacher listened to us.

81
00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:07,880
She did her hair for us.

82
00:10:07,880 --> 00:10:10,880
She was like a mother.

83
00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:13,880
She was like a big sister.

84
00:10:13,880 --> 00:10:17,880
The teachers are like that.

85
00:10:17,880 --> 00:10:27,880
We do hard things, but we don't feel
that way.

86
00:10:27,880 --> 00:10:32,880
We have that kind of personality.

87
00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:34,880
It's fun.

88
00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:38,880
We are blessed by the teachers.

89
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:48,880
We get praised a lot when we sing.

90
00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:54,880
But since Emi came, it changed.

91
00:10:54,880 --> 00:11:03,880
We used to sing together.

92
00:11:03,880 --> 00:11:16,880
But since Emi came, we have been able to
create our own strength.

93
00:11:16,880 --> 00:11:21,880
We don't have to force ourselves to fit
in with others.

94
00:11:21,880 --> 00:11:26,880
We have our own personality.

95
00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:33,880
But we are a group.

96
00:11:33,880 --> 00:11:38,880
We have our own voice.

97
00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:42,880
It's a big change.

98
00:11:42,880 --> 00:11:45,880
We are very grateful.

99
00:11:45,880 --> 00:11:48,880
We are very grateful to the teachers.

100
00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:51,880
Thank you.

101
00:11:51,880 --> 00:11:56,880
I think we are relieved.

102
00:11:56,880 --> 00:12:00,880
We have a lot of support.

103
00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:07,880
Even if we are worried, we are here.

104
00:12:07,880 --> 00:12:10,880
We don't have to rush.

105
00:12:10,880 --> 00:12:14,880
We are raised well.

106
00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:17,880
Please be assured.

107
00:12:17,880 --> 00:12:22,880
Please be assured.

108
00:12:23,776 --> 00:12:31,776
I think that there is no one who can
relate to this age.

109
00:12:31,776 --> 00:12:38,776
I think it's amazing.

110
00:12:38,776 --> 00:12:44,776
I'm still 20 years old, but I've only
lived for 20 years.

111
00:12:44,776 --> 00:12:54,776
I think it's fun to be involved with
thousands of people.

112
00:12:54,776 --> 00:12:59,776
It's fun to be involved with a lot of
people.

113
00:12:59,776 --> 00:13:10,776
I'm not good at it, but I think it's
fun.

114
00:13:10,776 --> 00:13:22,776
I'm grateful that there are people who
think it's good.

115
00:13:22,776 --> 00:13:29,776
I'm surprised that tens of thousands of
people know me.

116
00:13:29,776 --> 00:13:35,776
I'm grateful.

117
00:13:35,776 --> 00:13:40,776
Idols are not limited to singing and
dancing.

118
00:13:40,776 --> 00:13:46,776
I think it's a job that allows you to do
a lot of things.

119
00:13:46,776 --> 00:13:51,776
Everyone is good at acting and appearing
in magazines.

120
00:13:51,776 --> 00:13:56,776
I think I can do it because I'm in a
group.

121
00:13:56,776 --> 00:14:06,776
I'm worried about being alone in a
group.

122
00:14:06,776 --> 00:14:13,776
I'm glad that I'm in a group.

123
00:14:13,776 --> 00:14:20,776
I spend time with idols.

124
00:14:20,776 --> 00:14:26,776
I'm always motivated by various people.

125
00:14:26,776 --> 00:14:35,776
I want to show my new self to my fans.

126
00:14:35,776 --> 00:14:50,776
I'm glad that many idols support me.

127
00:14:50,776 --> 00:14:56,776
I wouldn't have been able to find it if
I didn't have it.

128
00:14:56,776 --> 00:15:05,776
I'm glad that there are many people who
support me.

129
00:15:05,776 --> 00:15:13,776
I'm glad that there are many people who
didn't dare to meet me if I didn't have
a job.

130
00:15:13,776 --> 00:15:34,776
I'm glad that I'm in a group that can
continue to grow.

131
00:15:34,776 --> 00:15:54,776
I'm glad that I'm in a group that can
continue to grow.
