Program purpose: Let's add "various things" to the idol group Shiritsu Ebisu Chugaku! Such a throwing experimental program "Ebichu ++ (Tasutasu)" has started! !
Shrimp medium + tissue, shrimp medium + curry, shrimp medium + Indian... Ebichu members collaborated on something and verified the results!
A variety show that unpredictably unfolds every time.
Also, in the program, we will introduce the activities of Ebichu research student "Sakura Ebi-zu"!
In addition, a game project in Shrimp was launched. What will be born from the collaboration between Ebichu and the game? ?

Program content: Continuing from last week, Kobayashi's project, the second member's main project, will be delivered! This project does only what Kaho Kobayashi wants to do. The second part starts from a corner where you just listen to her teacher, Yasumoto. The story develops in a dice talk format, but the project develops in an unexpected direction! ? A precious 2-shot talk of Ebichu members will be held! In addition, a new project has been launched for the Christmas university art festival! That musician who is familiar with the program will also participate in the producer of the unit song! A big announcement of the featured unit combinations selected in the draft format!
