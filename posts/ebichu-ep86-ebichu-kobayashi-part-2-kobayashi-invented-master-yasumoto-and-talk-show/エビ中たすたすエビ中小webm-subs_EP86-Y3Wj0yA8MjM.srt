1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
I will send you EBICHU TASASU Kobayashi.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:13,000
This week's EBICHU TASASU is the second
half of the Kobayashi project.

3
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:15,000
This is a dumpling with wings.

4
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:18,000
This is a dumpling with wings.

5
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:23,000
The first part is a corner where you
just listen to the story of Yasumoto.

6
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:24,000
Then.

7
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:30,000
I've known you since you were a kid.

8
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,000
I feel that EBICHU has changed as a
whole.

9
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:34,000
I agree.

10
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:38,000
There are many good stories that warm
your heart.

11
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:43,000
In addition, a new project for the
Christmas college game festival has been
launched.

12
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:46,000
What will happen?

13
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:52,000
Don't miss it tonight. Start EBICHU
TASASU.

14
00:01:05,306 --> 00:01:11,306
What should I do with the heart of a
chuuburarin?

15
00:01:11,306 --> 00:01:16,306
Moratorium, moratorium, moratorium,
junior high school students

16
00:01:16,306 --> 00:01:21,306
Add various things to private Ebisu
junior high school

17
00:01:21,306 --> 00:01:25,306
Ebisu Chassaku

18
00:01:25,306 --> 00:01:28,306
Your name is

19
00:01:28,306 --> 00:01:34,306
This program is provided by the sponsor
you see

20
00:01:34,906 --> 00:01:36,906
I want to be trapped in a house.

21
00:01:37,616 --> 00:01:40,616
I sometimes lose.

22
00:01:42,616 --> 00:01:44,616
Trick or treat!

23
00:01:45,616 --> 00:01:47,616
Kobayashi does what he wants to do.

24
00:01:48,616 --> 00:01:50,616
Emi-chutasu Kobayashi project.

25
00:01:52,616 --> 00:01:53,616
Everyone, please say one thing.

26
00:01:53,616 --> 00:01:55,616
It's a TV.

27
00:01:57,616 --> 00:01:59,616
We don't care about the criticism of the
central government.

28
00:02:00,616 --> 00:02:03,616
We will send you the whole world of
Kobayashi this time as well.

29
00:02:03,616 --> 00:02:05,616
I don't care.

30
00:02:06,664 --> 00:02:10,664
Last time, she flew a huge airplane that
she has been longing for since she was a
child.

31
00:02:10,664 --> 00:02:14,664
She did what she wanted to do.

32
00:02:15,664 --> 00:02:18,664
So, are you satisfied today?

33
00:02:18,664 --> 00:02:20,664
I'm very satisfied.

34
00:02:20,664 --> 00:02:22,664
So, your dream has come true?

35
00:02:22,664 --> 00:02:23,664
Yes, it has.

36
00:02:23,664 --> 00:02:24,664
Thank you very much.

37
00:02:24,664 --> 00:02:25,664
Is there anything else?

38
00:02:25,664 --> 00:02:27,664
There is one more thing.

39
00:02:27,664 --> 00:02:28,664
What is it?

40
00:02:28,664 --> 00:02:30,664
I want to talk to my master.

41
00:02:30,664 --> 00:02:31,664
What do you mean?

42
00:02:31,664 --> 00:02:35,664
You want to see your master, don't you?

43
00:02:35,664 --> 00:02:36,664
I do.

44
00:02:36,664 --> 00:02:37,664
I do.

45
00:02:37,664 --> 00:02:40,664
I think she is tired of seeing him.

46
00:02:40,664 --> 00:02:44,664
What does Yasumoto want to see?

47
00:02:45,664 --> 00:02:50,664
At the meeting before the show,
Kobayashi talked about Yasumoto.

48
00:02:50,664 --> 00:02:53,664
What is good about your master?

49
00:02:53,664 --> 00:02:56,664
He is a bit stoic.

50
00:02:56,664 --> 00:02:59,664
I respect his performance.

51
00:02:59,664 --> 00:03:03,664
I wonder how he can be so handsome.

52
00:03:03,664 --> 00:03:06,664
I will see him during the show.

53
00:03:07,664 --> 00:03:11,664
She shines so much that she is
fascinated during the show.

54
00:03:11,664 --> 00:03:15,664
She wants to feel more of Yasumoto's
charm.

55
00:03:15,664 --> 00:03:23,664
So, the talk show of Yasumoto started
with Kobayashi's wish.

56
00:03:23,664 --> 00:03:29,664
What is Kobayashi's wish?

57
00:03:31,118 --> 00:03:33,818
Another send off

58
00:03:34,198 --> 00:03:40,158
From now, I would like to talk about
myself with the Master

59
00:03:40,498 --> 00:03:43,578
I made him angry a little

60
00:03:43,738 --> 00:03:46,138
so I prepare something like this

61
00:03:46,138 --> 00:03:47,358
I'm grateful

62
00:03:47,358 --> 00:03:48,098
Ta-da

63
00:03:48,098 --> 00:03:49,578
Saikoro

64
00:03:49,578 --> 00:03:51,552
Yay!

65
00:03:51,552 --> 00:03:55,552
As you can see, the contents of the dice
are

66
00:03:55,552 --> 00:04:02,552
Kobayashi chose a narrow theme that only
the two who are close to each other can
understand.

67
00:04:02,552 --> 00:04:05,552
The members of Ebichu are waiting in a
separate room.

68
00:04:05,552 --> 00:04:10,000
As a viewer, they will watch from a
distance.

69
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
Let's start.

70
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,000
Shall we?

71
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,000
I'll start.

72
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
Yes, please.

73
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:30,000
What will come out?

74
00:04:30,714 --> 00:04:34,714
The best 3 movies you watched together,
please translate

75
00:04:34,714 --> 00:04:36,714
Emi?

76
00:04:36,714 --> 00:04:38,714
Emi?

77
00:04:38,714 --> 00:04:39,714
Emi?

78
00:04:39,714 --> 00:04:41,714
Emi is a name of a person

79
00:04:41,714 --> 00:04:44,714
We went to see 4 movies together

80
00:04:44,714 --> 00:04:46,714
About 4

81
00:04:46,714 --> 00:04:47,714
The first one is

82
00:04:47,714 --> 00:04:49,714
Your name is

83
00:04:49,714 --> 00:04:52,714

84
00:04:52,714 --> 00:04:56,714
Sailor uniform and machine gun

85
00:04:56,714 --> 00:04:59,714
Senior's girlfriend

86
00:04:59,714 --> 00:05:02,714
Love story

87
00:05:02,714 --> 00:05:05,714
I went to study

88
00:05:05,714 --> 00:05:10,714
Yasumoto herself, she watches 2 or 3
movies a day

89
00:05:10,714 --> 00:05:12,714
She watches 5 movies at most

90
00:05:12,714 --> 00:05:14,714
How much does she have free time?

91
00:05:14,714 --> 00:05:16,714
4 or 5

92
00:05:16,714 --> 00:05:18,714
Your name is

93
00:05:18,714 --> 00:05:20,714
Your name is

94
00:05:20,714 --> 00:05:22,714
This is definitely 1

95
00:05:22,714 --> 00:05:26,714
Your name is

96
00:05:26,714 --> 00:05:30,714
I took you to eat Shorompo before the
movie

97
00:05:30,714 --> 00:05:32,714
That was amazing

98
00:05:32,714 --> 00:05:33,714
It was delicious

99
00:05:33,714 --> 00:05:34,714
In Hong Kong

100
00:05:34,714 --> 00:05:35,714
Shorompo

101
00:05:35,714 --> 00:05:37,714
Taiwan

102
00:05:37,714 --> 00:05:39,714
We came back to Taiwan

103
00:05:39,714 --> 00:05:42,714
We couldn't forget Shorompo

104
00:05:42,714 --> 00:05:44,714
We went to eat Shorompo

105
00:05:44,714 --> 00:05:47,714
Then, we watched Your name

106
00:05:47,714 --> 00:05:49,714
That was good

107
00:05:49,714 --> 00:05:51,714
Your name is 1

108
00:05:51,714 --> 00:05:52,714
Yes

109
00:05:52,714 --> 00:05:53,714
What is 2?

110
00:05:53,714 --> 00:05:54,714
2?

111
00:05:54,714 --> 00:05:56,714
I am

112
00:05:56,714 --> 00:05:58,714
Orange

113
00:05:58,714 --> 00:06:00,714
Orange

114
00:06:00,714 --> 00:06:02,714
That was good

115
00:06:02,714 --> 00:06:04,714
Which one?

116
00:06:04,714 --> 00:06:06,714
It's difficult

117
00:06:06,714 --> 00:06:08,714
Kanna was cute

118
00:06:08,714 --> 00:06:11,714
Sailor uniform and machine gun

119
00:06:11,714 --> 00:06:14,714
What is this?

120
00:06:14,714 --> 00:06:17,714
Are you talking about the level of OAS?

121
00:06:17,714 --> 00:06:19,714
Is it a DVD special?

122
00:06:19,714 --> 00:06:24,714
To the next theme

123
00:06:28,624 --> 00:06:33,264
Aound the top..!

124
00:06:33,784 --> 00:06:34,444
Gate Noble

125
00:06:34,684 --> 00:06:36,904
about purse story turn upside down

126
00:06:36,904 --> 00:06:37,664
Thank you for watching!

127
00:06:37,664 --> 00:06:38,664
Gyobanashi

128
00:06:38,664 --> 00:06:39,664
Gyobanashi

129
00:06:39,664 --> 00:06:43,664
You can't do that kind of strong pose
without Gyoza

130
00:06:43,664 --> 00:06:44,664
Cute

131
00:06:44,664 --> 00:06:50,664
I recently got into Gyoza at home

132
00:06:50,664 --> 00:06:52,664
My dad often makes it

133
00:06:52,664 --> 00:06:54,664
We have to go to your house

134
00:06:54,664 --> 00:06:55,664
Yes

135
00:06:55,664 --> 00:06:56,664
Hane-tsuki Gyoza

136
00:06:56,664 --> 00:06:57,664
Gyoza with wings

137
00:06:57,664 --> 00:06:59,664
Gyoza with wings is delicious

138
00:06:59,664 --> 00:07:01,664
It's like a snack

139
00:07:02,712 --> 00:07:06,712
I want you to make it crispy and
delicious

140
00:07:06,712 --> 00:07:11,712
I make it once every two months

141
00:07:11,712 --> 00:07:12,712
You are a rare character

142
00:07:12,712 --> 00:07:14,712
You should tell your mother

143
00:07:14,712 --> 00:07:19,712
Mom, I can't move without eating gyoza

144
00:07:21,712 --> 00:07:23,712
I'm Kobayashi's mother

145
00:07:23,712 --> 00:07:26,712
Kobayashi's favorite gyoza

146
00:07:26,712 --> 00:07:29,712
I hope you make it

147
00:07:29,712 --> 00:07:31,712
Thank you

148
00:07:31,712 --> 00:07:33,712
I don't make gyoza too much

149
00:07:33,712 --> 00:07:36,712
You were so happy about gyoza

150
00:07:36,712 --> 00:07:42,712
To be continued

151
00:07:44,026 --> 00:07:45,026
I'm so happy

152
00:07:45,026 --> 00:07:48,026
Yasumoto's grateful story

153
00:07:49,026 --> 00:07:50,026
Hello

154
00:07:50,026 --> 00:07:51,026
Hello

155
00:07:52,026 --> 00:07:54,026
You're getting excited, Kaho-chan

156
00:07:54,026 --> 00:07:57,026
We went to a strawberry farm with my
family

157
00:07:57,026 --> 00:07:58,026
Strawberry farm?

158
00:07:58,026 --> 00:08:01,026
Yes, my family, my brother, my father,
my mother and me

159
00:08:01,026 --> 00:08:05,026
We went to a strawberry farm and we
stopped by a supermarket

160
00:08:05,026 --> 00:08:06,026
It was near here

161
00:08:06,026 --> 00:08:09,026
It was about my brother and my father

162
00:08:09,026 --> 00:08:12,026
There was a very shallow bath

163
00:08:12,026 --> 00:08:14,026
In a men's bath

164
00:08:14,026 --> 00:08:16,026
There was a shallow bath

165
00:08:16,026 --> 00:08:19,026
I thought it was a bath where you can
take a bath while lying down

166
00:08:19,026 --> 00:08:21,026
I thought so

167
00:08:21,026 --> 00:08:23,026
I went in and looked later

168
00:08:23,026 --> 00:08:24,026
It was a foot bath

169
00:08:24,026 --> 00:08:27,026
So my father and my brother

170
00:08:27,026 --> 00:08:29,026
On the way back from the strawberry farm

171
00:08:29,026 --> 00:08:32,026
I bathed my whole body with foot bath

172
00:08:32,026 --> 00:08:33,168
Please subscribe to our channel!

173
00:08:34,168 --> 00:08:35,168
End of story

174
00:08:35,168 --> 00:08:36,168
It's a good story

175
00:08:36,168 --> 00:08:37,168
It's a good story

176
00:08:37,168 --> 00:08:39,168
Yatsumotoki is getting a punch

177
00:08:39,168 --> 00:08:40,168
Thank you

178
00:08:40,168 --> 00:08:42,168
I'm not grateful at all

179
00:08:42,168 --> 00:08:46,168
It's a heartwarming story

180
00:08:46,168 --> 00:08:48,168
It was a good story

181
00:08:53,168 --> 00:08:55,168
What? What time is it?

182
00:08:55,168 --> 00:08:56,168
I hear something

183
00:08:56,168 --> 00:08:58,168
I heard a sound

184
00:08:58,168 --> 00:09:03,168
Is that the sound of the members?

185
00:09:03,168 --> 00:09:04,168
What?

186
00:09:04,168 --> 00:09:13,168
I want you to do a talk with other
members and teachers

187
00:09:13,168 --> 00:09:15,168
Not with Kaho?

188
00:09:15,168 --> 00:09:16,168
What?

189
00:09:16,168 --> 00:09:17,168
Yasu?

190
00:09:17,168 --> 00:09:18,168
What?

191
00:09:18,168 --> 00:09:21,168
This is a name tag

192
00:09:21,168 --> 00:09:24,000
There is a box

193
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,000
What?

194
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:32,000
They want to see Yasumoto's funny talk
from the outside

195
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:36,000
So they changed the members

196
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:40,000
Yasu is the burden

197
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,000
I will talk with Yasumoto

198
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,000
I will talk with Yasumoto

199
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,000
The new guest member is

200
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:51,000
Matsuda!

201
00:09:52,136 --> 00:09:53,136
Matsuda!

202
00:09:57,136 --> 00:09:59,136
Bye bye! Thank you very much!

203
00:10:00,136 --> 00:10:03,136
This was guest Kobayashi-san! Thank you
very much!

204
00:10:03,136 --> 00:10:11,136
Let's start the talk show with Kobayashi
Kikake and Yasumoto!

205
00:10:13,032 --> 00:10:15,032
I'm not scared!

206
00:10:16,032 --> 00:10:18,032
I've been watching you until now

207
00:10:18,032 --> 00:10:21,032
The next guest is Rina Matsuno

208
00:10:21,032 --> 00:10:23,032
Nice to meet you

209
00:10:24,032 --> 00:10:29,032
Kobayashi-san, you are not going to talk
with everyone, right?

210
00:10:29,032 --> 00:10:30,032
No, I'm not

211
00:10:30,032 --> 00:10:31,032
You're not?

212
00:10:31,032 --> 00:10:33,032
I'm going to watch the special talk show
with my master

213
00:10:33,032 --> 00:10:34,032
You're going to watch it?

214
00:10:34,032 --> 00:10:36,032
You want to watch it, right?

215
00:10:36,032 --> 00:10:38,032
I'm just a viewer

216
00:10:39,824 --> 00:10:44,824
Yasumoto Matsuno's first talk theme is

217
00:10:44,824 --> 00:10:48,824
Yasumoto's thankful story

218
00:10:48,824 --> 00:10:50,824
Yasubana

219
00:10:50,824 --> 00:10:52,824
Yasu, I'm only thinking about that

220
00:10:52,824 --> 00:10:54,824
I'm moved

221
00:10:54,824 --> 00:10:55,824
I'm moved

222
00:10:55,824 --> 00:10:56,824
I'm going to cry

223
00:10:56,824 --> 00:10:58,824
But the one I cried the most was

224
00:10:58,824 --> 00:11:00,824
If a cat disappeared from the world

225
00:11:00,824 --> 00:11:01,824
Ah, I wanted to see that

226
00:11:01,824 --> 00:11:02,824
The movie

227
00:11:02,824 --> 00:11:03,824
The movie again?

228
00:11:03,824 --> 00:11:04,824
The movie again

229
00:11:04,824 --> 00:11:06,824
I cried so much

230
00:11:06,824 --> 00:11:08,824
I cried so much

231
00:11:08,824 --> 00:11:10,824
I cried while making a face

232
00:11:10,824 --> 00:11:12,824
At the back of the movie theater

233
00:11:12,824 --> 00:11:13,824
At the back of the movie theater

234
00:11:13,824 --> 00:11:14,824
At the back of the movie theater

235
00:11:14,824 --> 00:11:16,824
I remember that well

236
00:11:16,824 --> 00:11:17,824
That's my favorite

237
00:11:17,824 --> 00:11:18,824
The back of the movie theater

238
00:11:18,824 --> 00:11:19,824
The back of the movie theater

239
00:11:19,824 --> 00:11:20,824
At the back of the movie theater

240
00:11:20,824 --> 00:11:23,824
I cried

241
00:11:23,824 --> 00:11:25,824
By the way, did you know that?

242
00:11:25,824 --> 00:11:27,824
The seat that the teacher liked the most

243
00:11:27,824 --> 00:11:28,824
The seat that the teacher liked the most

244
00:11:28,824 --> 00:11:29,824
It's the first time

245
00:11:29,824 --> 00:11:31,824
I'm going to sit there from next time

246
00:11:31,824 --> 00:11:32,824
No, no, no

247
00:11:32,824 --> 00:11:33,824
You can't sit there

248
00:11:33,824 --> 00:11:34,824
Why not?

249
00:11:34,824 --> 00:11:36,824
You can't sit there

250
00:11:36,824 --> 00:11:37,824
11th place

251
00:11:37,824 --> 00:11:38,824
11th place next to me

252
00:11:39,824 --> 00:11:40,824
That's good

253
00:11:40,824 --> 00:11:41,824
That's the story

254
00:11:41,824 --> 00:11:42,824
Next

255
00:11:42,824 --> 00:11:43,824
OK

256
00:11:43,824 --> 00:11:44,824
I don't like this

257
00:11:44,824 --> 00:11:45,824
I'm sure

258
00:11:45,824 --> 00:11:46,824
I'm sure

259
00:11:46,824 --> 00:11:48,824
It's coming, everyone

260
00:11:48,824 --> 00:11:49,824
Again?

261
00:11:49,824 --> 00:11:50,824
Again?

262
00:11:50,824 --> 00:11:51,824
Again?

263
00:11:51,824 --> 00:11:52,824
Wait

264
00:11:52,824 --> 00:11:55,824
What's the next guest?

265
00:11:55,824 --> 00:11:56,824
It's coming

266
00:11:56,824 --> 00:11:59,744
I'm sure you've been waiting

267
00:11:59,744 --> 00:12:00,804
Maya

268
00:12:07,258 --> 00:12:09,258
You were talking about it just now.

269
00:12:09,258 --> 00:12:11,258
I'm so happy.

270
00:12:12,258 --> 00:12:15,258
The next guest is Rika Mayama.

271
00:12:15,258 --> 00:12:18,258
What kind of talk will she talk about?

272
00:12:18,258 --> 00:12:22,432
The first theme is...

273
00:12:22,432 --> 00:12:24,432
The place we want to go together

274
00:12:24,432 --> 00:12:26,432
Futaba shop

275
00:12:26,432 --> 00:12:28,432
Futaba shop

276
00:12:28,432 --> 00:12:30,432
Futaba shop

277
00:12:30,432 --> 00:12:32,432
It's a bit like sumo

278
00:12:32,432 --> 00:12:34,432
I want to try it out

279
00:12:34,432 --> 00:12:36,432
Oh yeah

280
00:12:36,432 --> 00:12:38,432
Yasu is

281
00:12:38,432 --> 00:12:40,432
Yasu is really

282
00:12:40,432 --> 00:12:42,432
Elementary school student

283
00:12:42,432 --> 00:12:44,432
She was really quiet

284
00:12:44,432 --> 00:12:46,432
I know

285
00:12:46,432 --> 00:12:48,432
She was talking to her mom

286
00:12:48,432 --> 00:12:50,432
Her mom was here

287
00:12:50,432 --> 00:12:52,432
I was on the train

288
00:12:52,432 --> 00:12:54,432
I was talking to my mom

289
00:12:54,432 --> 00:12:56,432
My mom was talking to Yasu

290
00:12:56,432 --> 00:12:58,432
At that time, my stomach was really bad

291
00:12:58,432 --> 00:13:00,432
Every time my stomach hurt

292
00:13:00,432 --> 00:13:02,432
Basically

293
00:13:02,432 --> 00:13:04,432
I was like

294
00:13:04,432 --> 00:13:06,432
Yeah, yeah

295
00:13:06,432 --> 00:13:08,432
What? Are you stressed?

296
00:13:08,432 --> 00:13:10,432
No, no

297
00:13:10,432 --> 00:13:12,432
I'm learning

298
00:13:12,432 --> 00:13:14,432
I'm having a lot of fun

299
00:13:14,432 --> 00:13:16,432
That's the best

300
00:13:16,432 --> 00:13:18,432
Let's go somewhere

301
00:13:18,432 --> 00:13:20,432
The food is good

302
00:13:20,432 --> 00:13:22,432
Hokkaido is good

303
00:13:22,432 --> 00:13:24,432
It's just right

304
00:13:24,432 --> 00:13:26,432
The feeling of distance is just right

305
00:13:26,432 --> 00:13:28,432
Thank you

306
00:13:28,432 --> 00:13:30,432
I'm lonely

307
00:13:30,432 --> 00:13:32,432
I'm waiting for another visit

308
00:13:32,432 --> 00:13:34,432
Visit?

309
00:13:34,432 --> 00:13:36,432
It's like a shop

310
00:13:36,432 --> 00:13:38,432
It was a program, but it became a shop

311
00:13:38,432 --> 00:13:40,432
It seems to continue

312
00:13:42,432 --> 00:13:44,432
I'm happy

313
00:13:44,432 --> 00:13:46,432
I'm very comfortable

314
00:13:46,432 --> 00:13:48,432
Thank you

315
00:13:48,432 --> 00:13:50,432
See you

316
00:13:50,432 --> 00:13:52,432
Thank you for the viewers

317
00:13:52,432 --> 00:13:54,432
The next guest is

318
00:13:54,432 --> 00:13:56,432
Aika Hirota

319
00:13:56,432 --> 00:13:59,760
No, no, Yasumoto room

320
00:13:59,760 --> 00:14:01,760
What is the topic of their talk?

321
00:14:01,760 --> 00:14:03,760
The good points of each other

322
00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:05,760
In short

323
00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:07,760
High

324
00:14:07,760 --> 00:14:09,760
Oh, that's what you're talking about

325
00:14:09,760 --> 00:14:11,760
What is it?

326
00:14:11,760 --> 00:14:13,760
The good points of each other

327
00:14:13,760 --> 00:14:15,760
Well, I'm

328
00:14:15,760 --> 00:14:17,760
Yasumoto is shy

329
00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:19,760
Yasumoto is shy

330
00:14:19,760 --> 00:14:21,760
Yasumoto is shy

331
00:14:21,760 --> 00:14:23,760
To be continued

332
00:14:24,512 --> 00:14:33,512
Yasumoto is serious about her work

333
00:14:33,512 --> 00:14:37,512
I can't prepare in advance today

334
00:14:37,512 --> 00:14:40,512
I feel like I'm in a panic

335
00:14:40,512 --> 00:14:47,512
She prepares for tomorrow's event more
than anyone else

336
00:14:47,512 --> 00:14:53,512
She spends her time for Ebichu

337
00:14:53,512 --> 00:14:58,512
I feel like she spends her time for her
members

338
00:14:58,512 --> 00:14:59,512
Thank you

339
00:14:59,512 --> 00:15:00,512
I'm shy

340
00:15:00,512 --> 00:15:02,512
I'm glad

341
00:15:03,512 --> 00:15:04,512
Yasumoto is shy

342
00:15:04,512 --> 00:15:05,512
I'm shy

343
00:15:05,512 --> 00:15:07,512
She is shy

344
00:15:07,512 --> 00:15:09,512
She is shy when she sees shy Yasumoto

345
00:15:09,512 --> 00:15:11,512
I'm shy

346
00:15:12,512 --> 00:15:17,512
I want to learn from her

347
00:15:17,512 --> 00:15:21,512
I admire her for not being shy

348
00:15:21,512 --> 00:15:23,512
She is very shy

349
00:15:23,512 --> 00:15:25,512
She has a lot of character changes

350
00:15:25,512 --> 00:15:28,512
She was a vocaloid from the past

351
00:15:28,512 --> 00:15:29,512
She suddenly changed

352
00:15:29,512 --> 00:15:31,512
She became a charamoto

353
00:15:31,512 --> 00:15:37,512
She has her own personality and her own
opinion

354
00:15:37,512 --> 00:15:41,512
I admire her for being able to convey
her ideas to others

355
00:15:41,512 --> 00:15:43,512
I want to be like her

356
00:15:43,512 --> 00:15:49,512
She has changed a lot since the past

357
00:15:49,512 --> 00:15:55,512
I feel like she has changed the most
since she was in Ebichu

358
00:15:55,512 --> 00:15:59,512
I feel like the whole of Ebichu has
changed

359
00:15:59,512 --> 00:16:04,512
I'm glad that I can say what I feel to
others little by little

360
00:16:04,512 --> 00:16:10,512
But, I feel like I'm being held at home

361
00:16:10,512 --> 00:16:14,512
I feel like I'm being neglected

362
00:16:14,512 --> 00:16:18,512
I feel like I don't have to regret it

363
00:16:18,512 --> 00:16:20,512
She has that courage

364
00:16:20,512 --> 00:16:21,512
I think that's it

365
00:16:21,512 --> 00:16:24,512
Hirota talks

366
00:16:24,512 --> 00:16:27,512
She is like Tetsuko Kuroyanagi

367
00:16:27,512 --> 00:16:33,512
We are in the same group, so I hope we
can create an environment where we can
all talk like that

368
00:16:33,512 --> 00:16:35,512
Yes, that's right

369
00:16:35,512 --> 00:16:36,512
Thank you very much

370
00:16:36,512 --> 00:16:38,512
Thank you

371
00:16:38,512 --> 00:16:44,512
This time, the room for Yasumoto was
closed by Hirota

372
00:16:44,512 --> 00:16:45,512
It's closed?

373
00:16:45,512 --> 00:16:47,512
What's going on?

374
00:16:47,512 --> 00:16:49,512
Should we go?

375
00:16:49,512 --> 00:16:50,512
Can we go in?

376
00:16:50,512 --> 00:16:56,512
The Kobayashi project is about to end,
so all the members will meet

377
00:16:56,512 --> 00:16:59,512
Thank you for the meal

378
00:16:59,512 --> 00:17:03,512
Kobayashi enjoyed the appearance of
Yasumoto

379
00:17:03,512 --> 00:17:05,512
How was it?

380
00:17:05,512 --> 00:17:06,512
It was interesting

381
00:17:06,512 --> 00:17:08,512
I think I can keep watching

382
00:17:08,512 --> 00:17:10,512
What was Yasumoto like?

383
00:17:10,512 --> 00:17:11,512
He was very cute

384
00:17:11,512 --> 00:17:13,512
Did Kobayashi see that?

385
00:17:13,512 --> 00:17:14,512
No

386
00:17:14,512 --> 00:17:16,512
Why?

387
00:17:16,512 --> 00:17:18,512
The students were also embarrassed

388
00:17:18,512 --> 00:17:20,512
They were together

389
00:17:20,512 --> 00:17:23,512
They were both good, so it was good

390
00:17:23,512 --> 00:17:29,512
Kobayashi was very satisfied to learn
about Yasumoto's new side

391
00:17:29,512 --> 00:17:34,512
Next, Ebichu's special information

392
00:17:34,512 --> 00:17:38,512
University student news

393
00:17:38,512 --> 00:17:43,512
Ebichu's annual event, University
student meeting

394
00:17:43,512 --> 00:17:47,512
The university student meeting's
specialty, the unit project

395
00:17:47,512 --> 00:17:50,512
This year, a new attempt that has never
been done before

396
00:17:50,512 --> 00:17:56,512
That is the draft meeting of the unit
members

397
00:17:56,512 --> 00:18:01,512
This time, the unit project is requested
by the three super-gorgeous producers

398
00:18:01,512 --> 00:18:06,512
And each producer selects a member to
choose from their unit

399
00:18:06,512 --> 00:18:09,512
The unit is decided in the form of a
draft meeting

400
00:18:09,512 --> 00:18:15,456
The result of the draft meeting is as
follows

401
00:18:16,456 --> 00:18:21,456
Now, the private Ebisu junior high
school unit member draft meeting starts

402
00:18:22,456 --> 00:18:24,456
Producer, Kaiki Ogata

403
00:18:24,456 --> 00:18:25,456
Yes

404
00:18:25,456 --> 00:18:36,122
The first draft meeting, the member they
want to select is...

405
00:18:36,122 --> 00:18:38,122
Riko Nakayama!

406
00:18:39,122 --> 00:18:40,122
I see.

407
00:18:40,122 --> 00:18:44,122
She doesn't know what kind of music
she's going to make.

408
00:18:44,122 --> 00:18:47,122
She doesn't know either.

409
00:18:47,122 --> 00:18:51,122
She doesn't know what she's thinking
about.

410
00:18:52,122 --> 00:18:55,122
But she's so explosive.

411
00:18:55,122 --> 00:18:57,122
Riko Nakayama!

412
00:18:57,122 --> 00:19:00,122
Next, Kakuta from Tokyo 03.

413
00:19:00,122 --> 00:19:06,122
The first selection of members is...

414
00:19:07,162 --> 00:19:09,162
Aika Hiroto.

415
00:19:09,162 --> 00:19:11,162
I see.

416
00:19:11,162 --> 00:19:13,162
I see.

417
00:19:13,162 --> 00:19:15,162
I saw her in the movie, Hirono
Sentozake.

418
00:19:15,162 --> 00:19:17,162
She was in the movie.

419
00:19:17,162 --> 00:19:20,162
So I think I know her well.

420
00:19:20,162 --> 00:19:24,162
And I think her voice is unique.

421
00:19:24,162 --> 00:19:27,162
So I chose Aika Hiroto.

422
00:19:28,162 --> 00:19:31,162
Next, Tenkomori Satsuki.

423
00:19:31,162 --> 00:19:36,506
The first selection of members is...

424
00:19:36,506 --> 00:19:39,506
I'll go with Mayaba-san

425
00:19:39,506 --> 00:19:44,506
I was in a team of 2 or 3

426
00:19:44,506 --> 00:19:46,506
I didn't know what to write

427
00:19:46,506 --> 00:19:50,506
I wrote the keyword, child-san

428
00:19:50,506 --> 00:19:55,506
I think the youngest child-san is the
youngest, the youngest child-san

429
00:19:55,506 --> 00:19:59,056
I think it's a good start, Mayaba-san

430
00:19:59,056 --> 00:20:04,056
The draft meeting continued after the
second round.

431
00:20:05,056 --> 00:20:12,056
Ogata chose Hinata Kashiwagi, Kaho
Kobayashi, and Riko Nakayama.

432
00:20:13,056 --> 00:20:19,056
Takuta chose Aika Hirota and Mirei
Hoshina.

433
00:20:20,056 --> 00:20:27,056
And Tenkomori Satsuki chose Rika Mayama,
Ayaka Yasumoto, and Rina Matsuno.

434
00:20:27,056 --> 00:20:30,056
Actually, this combination...

435
00:20:31,056 --> 00:20:34,056
I've never seen this combination before.

436
00:20:35,056 --> 00:20:37,056
This is good.

437
00:20:37,056 --> 00:20:39,056
It's getting better.

438
00:20:41,056 --> 00:20:45,056
Yes, this is the first combination ever.

439
00:20:46,056 --> 00:20:53,056
I think this combination is interesting.

440
00:20:53,056 --> 00:20:58,056
I think it's better than my usual
combination.

441
00:20:58,056 --> 00:21:02,056
I don't know much about idol groups.

442
00:21:03,056 --> 00:21:05,056
I've never been on good terms with them.

443
00:21:05,056 --> 00:21:08,056
I'm glad I'm not on good terms with
them.

444
00:21:08,056 --> 00:21:10,056
It's embarrassing.

445
00:21:11,056 --> 00:21:16,056
In addition, the theme and theme of the
song will be given to the unit.

446
00:21:17,056 --> 00:21:21,056
It's a song called Ocean's Guide, which
is a college game.

447
00:21:21,056 --> 00:21:25,056
What kind of theme will be decided by
lottery?

448
00:21:25,056 --> 00:21:35,002
What is the theme of the song played by
Ogata?

449
00:21:35,002 --> 00:21:37,002
and back to glass isn't hot.

450
00:21:37,002 --> 00:21:38,002
Thank you.

451
00:21:38,080 --> 00:21:40,080
Ito Gin-chan!

452
00:21:40,080 --> 00:21:42,080
It's the same feeling.

453
00:21:44,080 --> 00:21:45,080
Eh?

454
00:21:45,080 --> 00:21:47,080
Isn't it something like a love song?

455
00:21:47,080 --> 00:21:49,080
This is troublesome.

456
00:21:49,080 --> 00:21:50,080
I can't say anything.

457
00:21:50,080 --> 00:21:53,080
I've never had an emotional input into
Ito Gin-chan.

458
00:21:54,080 --> 00:21:58,080
Next, the theme that Tokyo 03 Takuta
chose is...

459
00:21:59,080 --> 00:22:00,080
Crab!

460
00:22:01,080 --> 00:22:02,080
Well, well, well.

461
00:22:02,080 --> 00:22:03,080
Crab, huh.

462
00:22:03,080 --> 00:22:05,080
Crab, it's good, somehow.

463
00:22:05,080 --> 00:22:08,080
I can't walk while facing forward.

464
00:22:08,080 --> 00:22:13,080
I can't avoid it while standing
sideways.

465
00:22:13,080 --> 00:22:15,080
That kind of feeling is...

466
00:22:15,080 --> 00:22:17,080
It's a bit of a dull direction.

467
00:22:17,080 --> 00:22:19,080
It's a bit of a dull direction.

468
00:22:19,080 --> 00:22:20,080
You're forcing it, aren't you?

469
00:22:20,080 --> 00:22:21,080
You're forcing it, aren't you?

470
00:22:21,080 --> 00:22:22,080
You're forcing it, aren't you?

471
00:22:23,080 --> 00:22:27,080
Next, the theme that Satsuki and
Tenkomori chose is...

472
00:22:28,080 --> 00:22:29,080
Fish!

473
00:22:29,080 --> 00:22:30,080
Fish!

474
00:22:31,672 --> 00:22:32,672
It's cute.

475
00:22:34,672 --> 00:22:35,672
It's a fish.

476
00:22:35,672 --> 00:22:37,672
I got it right.

477
00:22:37,672 --> 00:22:38,672
It's a pop.

478
00:22:38,672 --> 00:22:40,672
It's a good match.

479
00:22:40,672 --> 00:22:41,672
I'm glad it's a bear.

480
00:22:41,672 --> 00:22:44,672
What kind of song do you think it is?

481
00:22:44,672 --> 00:22:47,672
As you said, it's a pop song.

482
00:22:47,672 --> 00:22:49,672
It's not that fast.

483
00:22:49,672 --> 00:22:53,672
The color is shiny.

484
00:22:53,672 --> 00:22:57,672
It's a fish with a main title, Ocean's
Guide.

485
00:22:57,672 --> 00:23:00,672
I think it's a fish that's not strange.

486
00:23:00,672 --> 00:23:02,672
I think it's easy to fit in.

487
00:23:03,672 --> 00:23:07,672
The final result was decided by lottery.

488
00:23:08,672 --> 00:23:11,672
Ogata is in a hurry.

489
00:23:11,672 --> 00:23:16,672
The theme is the dance number that any
shy person will dance.

490
00:23:16,672 --> 00:23:20,064
Rock'n'Roll

491
00:23:20,064 --> 00:23:22,064
I think I can do it.

492
00:23:22,064 --> 00:23:26,064
So I'm going to stick to the rock band.

493
00:23:26,064 --> 00:23:28,064
I'd like to try it.

494
00:23:29,064 --> 00:23:33,064
Tokyo 03 Kakuta's theme is a crab.

495
00:23:33,064 --> 00:23:38,064
The theme is this cute shiny Christmas
song.

496
00:23:38,064 --> 00:23:42,064
I'm going to wake up and go to the
police station.

497
00:23:42,064 --> 00:23:46,064
I'm going to make it to the live show.

498
00:23:46,064 --> 00:23:50,064
I want to do my best with the two of
them.

499
00:23:50,064 --> 00:23:54,064
And Tenkomori Satsuki's theme is bear.

500
00:23:54,064 --> 00:23:57,064
The theme is refreshing and crazy.

501
00:23:57,064 --> 00:23:59,064
It's decided to be a party tune.

502
00:23:59,064 --> 00:24:03,064
I think I can do the theme itself to
some extent.

503
00:24:03,064 --> 00:24:10,064
I'm going to split it into different
sections to make it sound refreshing and
crazy.

504
00:24:10,064 --> 00:24:13,064
I'm going to change the subject.

505
00:24:13,064 --> 00:24:15,064
I think I'll be fine.

506
00:24:15,064 --> 00:24:18,064
I'll do my best, so please look forward
to it.

507
00:24:19,064 --> 00:24:23,064
What kind of unit song will be
completed?

508
00:24:23,064 --> 00:24:27,064
Christmas University Theater, which will
be held over two days.

509
00:24:27,064 --> 00:24:30,064
Shrimp-Chu Ocean's Guide

510
00:24:30,064 --> 00:24:35,064
For more information, please visit the
Shiritsu Ebisu Junior High School
website.

511
00:24:36,064 --> 00:24:42,064
Next time, we'll have a big announcement
of the serious news of shrimp-chu
Tastas.

512
00:24:42,064 --> 00:24:44,064
The second day of this broadcast is my
birthday.

513
00:24:44,064 --> 00:24:49,064
Just before the 20th, the members came
up with a new phrase for Mayama.

514
00:24:49,064 --> 00:24:52,064
Gari Gari Ramen Junior High School

515
00:24:52,064 --> 00:24:54,064
It's like a one-shot gag.

516
00:24:54,064 --> 00:24:57,824
What will happen?

517
00:24:57,824 --> 00:25:01,824
This program was brought to you by the
following sponsors.
