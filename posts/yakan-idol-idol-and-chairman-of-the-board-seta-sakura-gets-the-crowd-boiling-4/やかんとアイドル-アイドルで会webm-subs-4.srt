1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
The nightclub and idols!

2
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:12,000
It's very important, isn't it?

3
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Yes, it's really important.

4
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:19,000
I'm an idol who works in Kyushu,

5
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:25,000
so I think there are people who think
it's difficult to come to Kyushu.

6
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:32,000
So I think it's a very good environment
for those people to talk equally.

7
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:37,000
Do you have any people who watched your
stream and referred to it?

8
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:39,000
Do you have any favorite streamers?

9
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,000
I'm a little too much, but...

10
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:46,000
Basically, I like people who are playing
games,

11
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:50,000
and VTubers.

12
00:00:50,000 --> 00:01:02,000
When I'm on my phone all day, I watch
videos of streamers on YouTube.

13
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:05,000
Are you interested in VTubers?

14
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:07,000
Yes, I am.

15
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:11,000
I've never been a Vtuber,

16
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:16,000
but I've always liked anime characters.

17
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:23,000
I like that anime characters talk with
their own characters.

18
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:26,000
This is different from voice actors.

19
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
That's right.

20
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:33,000
Maybe I'm already a Vtuber.

21
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,000
Maybe.

22
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:40,000
It would be interesting if I had a real
face.

23
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:56,000
I think there are many genres of VTubers
that people who like VTubers like.

24
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:59,000
If I have both sides,

25
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:02,000
VTubers will also watch it and think,

26
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:06,000
Oh, this person is playing it in real
life.

27
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:09,000
I think it would be interesting to play
it.

28
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:12,000
That's what's on the air.

29
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:19,000
I think it's a place where I talk about
what I like.

30
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:23,000
There are many parts that I can't talk
about.

31
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:28,000
When I'm on a live show, I talk about my
life as a Vtuber.

32
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:32,000
I don't talk about my life in that way.

33
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:36,000
I want to see you without the emitter.

34
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:43,000
There are some places where I talk about
my life.

35
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:47,000
I want to make a Vtuber character.

36
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:50,000
When people watch my live show,

37
00:02:50,000 --> 00:03:00,000
they say that I have a different image
from Seta.

38
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:12,000
If you have a different image, please
check the live show.

39
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:16,000
I'm going to show you my morning
routine.

40
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:21,000
Good morning, everyone.

41
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:24,000
I'm Airi, the crown pop artist.

42
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Today, I would like to show you my
morning routine.

43
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:35,000
I'm going to take a morning routine.

44
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:39,000
I was very happy when I heard that.

45
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:45,000
I saw a lot of YouTubers doing morning
routines.

46
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:48,000
I wanted to try it.

47
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:53,000
I don't have a chance to show it to
everyone.

48
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:56,000
I was very happy.
