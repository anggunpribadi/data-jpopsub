An exciting school trip in Gero! 98th period. Delivered from Gero City, Gifu Prefecture, with the cooperation of Yukai Resort Gero Saichoraku! This is the last of the school excursion edition! I'm going to bra in the hot spring town. While strolling around the city, for some reason Chaplin appears at the photo spot on the bridge..., I wonder if I could take a picture with Chaplin ~

The first place I came to was Sarubobo House. A lot of Sarubobo goods are lined up inside, and it seems that there is some kind of profit! So I ordered Hida Beef Buns, which I was interested in on the signboard of the shop. You can feel the umami of the meat and it's delicious~

The next stop is Sarubobo Shrine, Lots of Sarubobo Ema with faces drawn on them! The reason why Sarubobo doesn't have a face is to reflect his current expression! Ending at Hida River.

It was a very fun school trip, visiting various spots and taking great pictures!
