1
00:00:03,040 --> 00:00:10,040
On Earth, our 3rd album, Anarki, is
getting a lot of attention.

2
00:00:10,040 --> 00:00:13,040
Wow!

3
00:00:13,040 --> 00:00:14,040
Shake!

4
00:00:14,040 --> 00:00:17,040
Shake!

5
00:00:17,040 --> 00:00:20,040
Anarki!

6
00:00:20,040 --> 00:00:23,040
Anarki reacted!

7
00:00:23,040 --> 00:00:24,040
You're here again!

8
00:00:24,040 --> 00:00:26,040
We're going to do a Mama Nuki with the
members' photos.

9
00:00:26,040 --> 00:00:30,040
We don't know which one is the Joker, so
we're going to do it in a so-called Jiji
Nuki rule.

10
00:00:30,040 --> 00:00:35,040
If you get a pair, the person in the
photo will tell you the story of the
photo.

11
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:36,040
Oh!

12
00:00:36,040 --> 00:00:42,040
By the way, the photo of this card is a
photo of the first release of the album.

13
00:00:42,040 --> 00:00:44,040
Let's do this.

14
00:00:44,040 --> 00:00:46,040
This is the Jiji card.

15
00:00:46,040 --> 00:00:48,040
Everyone, please prepare the card.

16
00:00:48,040 --> 00:00:50,040
What is this?

17
00:00:50,040 --> 00:00:52,040
What is this?

18
00:00:52,040 --> 00:00:54,040
There's a really cute girl.

19
00:00:54,040 --> 00:00:55,040
What's a?

20
00:00:55,040 --> 00:00:56,040
?

21
00:00:56,040 --> 00:00:58,040
You don't tell me the?

22
00:00:58,040 --> 00:01:00,040
You'll know if you do it.

23
00:01:00,040 --> 00:01:01,968
Mama Nuki Start!

24
00:01:02,968 --> 00:01:04,968
It's like a party.

25
00:01:04,968 --> 00:01:06,968
I didn't get it.

26
00:01:10,968 --> 00:01:11,968
Who is it?

27
00:01:11,968 --> 00:01:12,968
I don't know.

28
00:01:12,968 --> 00:01:14,968
Who is it?

29
00:01:14,968 --> 00:01:16,968
There's a kid I don't know.

30
00:01:17,968 --> 00:01:18,968
Who is it?

31
00:01:18,968 --> 00:01:19,968
It's me.

32
00:01:19,968 --> 00:01:20,968
I don't know.

33
00:01:21,968 --> 00:01:23,968
What do you mean?

34
00:01:23,968 --> 00:01:25,968
When Keith first came to the station.

35
00:01:25,968 --> 00:01:27,968
That's why I'm looking at Keith.

36
00:01:27,968 --> 00:01:29,968
Is that my face?

37
00:01:29,968 --> 00:01:30,968
I didn't know.

38
00:01:30,968 --> 00:01:31,968
It's the same.

39
00:01:31,968 --> 00:01:33,968
Your face is different.

40
00:01:33,968 --> 00:01:34,968
Did you study?

41
00:01:34,968 --> 00:01:36,968
No, I didn't.

42
00:01:36,968 --> 00:01:37,968
Wait, wait, wait.

43
00:01:37,968 --> 00:01:39,968
I didn't say that.

44
00:01:39,968 --> 00:01:40,968
I didn't.

45
00:01:42,968 --> 00:01:43,968
I got it.

46
00:01:43,968 --> 00:01:45,968
Why do you look so half-hearted?

47
00:01:45,968 --> 00:01:48,968
This is a nose-blowing.

48
00:01:48,968 --> 00:01:51,968
It's a trend to laugh naturally.

49
00:01:51,968 --> 00:01:52,968
Try it.

50
00:01:52,968 --> 00:01:53,968
Start!

51
00:01:54,968 --> 00:01:55,968
I'm sorry.

52
00:01:55,968 --> 00:01:59,968
I'm sorry.

53
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,000
HAPPY CHU!

54
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,000
What's this?

55
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,000
I got it.

56
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,000
What's this?

57
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,000
Is this for Hinata?

58
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,000
Yes, it's me.

59
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,000
I'm a puppy.

60
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,000
What a girl!

61
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,000
Ta-da!

62
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,000
Oh, a dog.

63
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,000
Yes, yes, yes.

64
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,000
I got it.

65
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,000
So fast!

66
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,000
Ta-da!

67
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,000
It's cute.

68
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,000
Who is this?

69
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,000
Yes.

70
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,000
Riko, can you ski?

71
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:34,000
I can't do it now because I'm afraid of
getting hurt.

72
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,000
But I've been doing it.

73
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,000
Oh, really?

74
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,000
Then, teach me next time.

75
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,000
Okay.

76
00:02:42,256 --> 00:02:43,256
What?

77
00:02:43,256 --> 00:02:44,256
All of them?

78
00:02:44,256 --> 00:02:45,256
All of them?

79
00:02:45,256 --> 00:02:46,256
All of them

80
00:02:46,256 --> 00:02:47,256
Where did you draw?

81
00:02:49,256 --> 00:02:50,256
What did you draw?

82
00:02:50,256 --> 00:02:52,256
It's a party!

83
00:02:53,156 --> 00:02:55,776
If you chose this card, you have to add
a belphegor ear

84
00:02:55,776 --> 00:02:57,436
It's mainly attached to her ear. It's
fine

85
00:02:57,436 --> 00:02:59,656
And add a pin in the stomach and we can
continue a cute talking

86
00:03:00,116 --> 00:03:03,036
This is Yagii Ryo, when I am going to
say PAPADAKI than you must say PION

87
00:03:11,296 --> 00:03:13,496
This is Toyoshika

88
00:03:14,556 --> 00:03:15,676
Wow

89
00:03:15,316 --> 00:03:17,956
Hey Kanon, you have come out

90
00:03:19,276 --> 00:03:20,216
I didn't

91
00:03:20,076 --> 00:03:21,576
Why you only got one?

92
00:03:21,576 --> 00:03:24,576
I'm not here anymore. I'm Kobashi-Kaoh.

93
00:03:28,576 --> 00:03:31,576
Why are you not happy?

94
00:03:31,576 --> 00:03:33,576
I'm not happy.

95
00:03:33,576 --> 00:03:34,576
I'm not happy.

96
00:03:34,576 --> 00:03:36,576
I'm not happy.

97
00:03:37,576 --> 00:03:41,576
But, this is really a real smile.

98
00:03:41,576 --> 00:03:42,576
Close your eyes.

99
00:03:42,576 --> 00:03:44,576
This is a real smile.

100
00:03:44,576 --> 00:03:45,576
It's amazing.

101
00:03:45,576 --> 00:03:46,576
My birthday.

102
00:03:46,576 --> 00:03:48,576
Is this the size of 5 years old?

103
00:03:48,576 --> 00:03:51,576
I'm older than you.

104
00:03:51,576 --> 00:03:54,576
I'm not younger than you.

105
00:03:54,576 --> 00:03:55,576
I'm not younger than you.

106
00:03:55,576 --> 00:03:56,576
I'm not younger than you.

107
00:03:56,576 --> 00:03:58,576
I'm 5 years older than you.

108
00:04:05,576 --> 00:04:06,576
This is cute.

109
00:04:06,576 --> 00:04:07,576
This is cute.

110
00:04:07,576 --> 00:04:08,576
Who is this?

111
00:04:08,576 --> 00:04:09,576
This is me.

112
00:04:09,576 --> 00:04:12,576
My mother or father is taking a picture.

113
00:04:12,576 --> 00:04:14,576
I'm holding the camera.

114
00:04:14,576 --> 00:04:17,576
I'm holding the camera.

115
00:04:17,576 --> 00:04:18,576
This is cute.

116
00:04:20,576 --> 00:04:21,576
I'm holding the camera.

117
00:04:22,576 --> 00:04:23,576
I'm holding the camera.

118
00:04:24,576 --> 00:04:25,576
January 1st.

119
00:04:25,576 --> 00:04:31,576
My mother or father is taking a picture.

120
00:04:31,576 --> 00:04:33,576
I'm holding the camera.

121
00:04:35,576 --> 00:04:36,576
This is you.

122
00:04:36,576 --> 00:04:38,576
I don't have a picture of me taking a
picture.

123
00:04:38,576 --> 00:04:40,576
I uploaded all the pictures to the blog.

124
00:04:40,576 --> 00:04:42,576
I was told that I didn't upload the
picture.

125
00:04:42,576 --> 00:04:44,576
I took a picture of me not uploading the
picture.

126
00:04:44,576 --> 00:04:45,576
I'm holding the camera.

127
00:04:45,576 --> 00:04:47,576
I'm holding the camera.

128
00:04:48,576 --> 00:04:49,576
I'm holding the camera.

129
00:04:49,576 --> 00:04:51,576
This was the only picture.

130
00:04:51,576 --> 00:04:52,576
This is the picture I took when I was in
the first grade of elementary school.

131
00:04:52,576 --> 00:04:56,576
This is the picture I took when I was in
the first grade of elementary school.

132
00:04:56,576 --> 00:04:59,376
Once you removed this, your honor will
be activated.

133
00:05:04,096 --> 00:05:07,856
Well done Wha...

134
00:05:07,856 --> 00:05:08,856
I'm not

135
00:05:08,856 --> 00:05:11,856
This is a photo of my brother
celebrating his birthday

136
00:05:11,856 --> 00:05:15,856
He says he won't blow out the candles
because it's embarrassing

137
00:05:15,856 --> 00:05:17,856
So I'm going to replace Yasu

138
00:05:18,856 --> 00:05:20,856
It's a grandma

139
00:05:21,856 --> 00:05:22,856
It's me

140
00:05:22,856 --> 00:05:23,856
It's a grandpa

141
00:05:24,856 --> 00:05:28,856
My grandma came to my house and said
this is the Rainbow Bridge

142
00:05:28,856 --> 00:05:30,856
I'm going to replace my grandma

143
00:05:30,856 --> 00:05:32,856
Then I'm going to play the card of mom
crying

144
00:05:32,856 --> 00:05:35,856
I want to play the card of Hiro and Aika

145
00:05:35,856 --> 00:05:37,856
Please, hurry

146
00:05:37,856 --> 00:05:39,856
Which one should I choose?

147
00:05:43,856 --> 00:05:46,856
I chose my own

148
00:05:46,856 --> 00:05:47,856
Cute

149
00:05:47,856 --> 00:05:53,856
My mom loved boarders and she kissed me
a lot when I was a kid

150
00:05:53,856 --> 00:05:56,856
She said she didn't want to wear a bow
tie

151
00:05:57,856 --> 00:05:59,856
I like it now

152
00:05:59,856 --> 00:06:04,736
I'm going to replace my grandma

153
00:06:05,736 --> 00:06:06,736
I see

154
00:06:07,736 --> 00:06:08,736
I see

155
00:06:09,736 --> 00:06:10,736
Excuse me

156
00:06:11,736 --> 00:06:12,736
It was very funky

157
00:06:13,736 --> 00:06:14,736
I didn't get it

158
00:06:16,736 --> 00:06:17,736
I didn't get it

159
00:06:17,736 --> 00:06:19,736
I'm going to replace my grandma

160
00:06:19,736 --> 00:06:21,360
Zyuoh theurst!

161
00:06:22,360 --> 00:06:23,360
I'm scared!

162
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:25,360
How are you feeling today?

163
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:26,360
I'm not good

164
00:06:26,360 --> 00:06:29,360
You will feel like a rabbit

165
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:31,360
I'm a rabbit!

166
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:33,360
I'm a rabbit!

167
00:06:38,360 --> 00:06:40,360
I'm so honored

168
00:06:40,360 --> 00:06:42,360
Thank you always

169
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:45,360
Yay! We are all here!

170
00:06:46,552 --> 00:06:49,552
We went to buy some things at Mayama's
smoothie shop

171
00:06:49,552 --> 00:06:51,552
We bought it while we were working

172
00:06:51,552 --> 00:06:54,552
This is Mayama's smoothie

173
00:06:54,552 --> 00:06:55,552
I see

174
00:06:55,552 --> 00:06:59,552
Which card do you recommend, Usagi-san?

175
00:06:59,552 --> 00:07:00,552
There are only 3 cards

176
00:07:00,552 --> 00:07:01,552
You are fast

177
00:07:03,552 --> 00:07:05,552
You are picking up cards again

178
00:07:07,552 --> 00:07:08,552
You are picking up cards again

179
00:07:09,552 --> 00:07:11,552
Cute

180
00:07:12,552 --> 00:07:13,552
This one

181
00:07:13,552 --> 00:07:15,552
I'm sad

182
00:07:17,368 --> 00:07:18,368
What? Is it a secret?

183
00:07:18,368 --> 00:07:20,368
There is a milk shop in Nakayama

184
00:07:20,368 --> 00:07:22,368
I LINEd Riko-chan

185
00:07:22,368 --> 00:07:26,368
I'm the manager of the fourth generation
of the VITA

186
00:07:26,368 --> 00:07:28,368
You did it?

187
00:07:28,368 --> 00:07:32,368
It's a picture of memories

188
00:07:35,272 --> 00:07:37,272
It's so good!

189
00:07:37,272 --> 00:07:38,272
Why is it a year?

190
00:07:38,272 --> 00:07:40,272
I'm sorry, everyone!

191
00:07:43,272 --> 00:07:47,272
I'm taking a picture of Rina and Mirei

192
00:07:47,272 --> 00:07:49,272
I'm taking a picture of Riko

193
00:07:49,272 --> 00:07:51,272
Mayama-san is like,

194
00:07:51,272 --> 00:07:54,272
I can't feel their youth, so I'm doing
this

195
00:07:54,272 --> 00:07:56,272
Everyone is watching

196
00:07:56,272 --> 00:07:58,272
I'm next to them, so I'm like

197
00:07:58,272 --> 00:08:00,272
I'm taking a picture

198
00:08:00,272 --> 00:08:03,272
We're having a party!

199
00:08:04,272 --> 00:08:06,272
I'm here!

200
00:08:06,272 --> 00:08:08,272
So cute!

201
00:08:08,272 --> 00:08:10,272
I am a bird

202
00:08:12,272 --> 00:08:14,272
It's a fish tank

203
00:08:14,272 --> 00:08:16,272
Fish tank Kobayashi

204
00:08:16,272 --> 00:08:19,272
I'm in the fish tank

205
00:08:20,272 --> 00:08:21,272
It's cute, right?

206
00:08:21,272 --> 00:08:23,272
It's cute, but it's not

207
00:08:23,272 --> 00:08:25,272
I'm holding it

208
00:08:25,272 --> 00:08:26,272
It's a hole

209
00:08:26,272 --> 00:08:26,736
It's cute!

210
00:08:27,736 --> 00:08:29,736
Wow!

211
00:08:29,736 --> 00:08:32,736
I was going to catch a UFO for the first
time in my life

212
00:08:32,736 --> 00:08:35,736
My friend said, I'm sad that I can't
take a picture, so I'll take a picture

213
00:08:35,736 --> 00:08:37,736
And she took it for me

214
00:08:37,736 --> 00:08:38,736
Wow!

215
00:08:38,736 --> 00:08:40,736
I did it!

216
00:08:40,736 --> 00:08:41,736
Ta-da!

217
00:08:41,736 --> 00:08:43,736
Wow!

218
00:08:43,736 --> 00:08:45,736
Wow!

219
00:08:45,736 --> 00:08:46,736
It's so cute!

220
00:08:46,736 --> 00:08:49,736
It's a picture of a yearling's swimming
club

221
00:08:49,736 --> 00:08:51,736
It was a picture of a rabbit

222
00:08:51,736 --> 00:08:52,736
It's cute

223
00:08:52,736 --> 00:08:56,736
I only liked pink at that time

224
00:08:56,736 --> 00:08:58,736
So, I was a rabbit with two colors

225
00:08:58,736 --> 00:09:02,736
I competed with pink in orange or pink
in pink

226
00:09:02,736 --> 00:09:04,736
But I was an adult

227
00:09:04,736 --> 00:09:05,736
You said, it's OK

228
00:09:05,736 --> 00:09:07,736
I said, it's OK, I'll wear orange

229
00:09:07,736 --> 00:09:09,736
I woke up to orange

230
00:09:11,320 --> 00:09:12,320
I'm wearing pink now

231
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:14,320
I have rabbit ears

232
00:09:15,320 --> 00:09:17,320
It was a dream, right?

233
00:09:17,320 --> 00:09:19,320
I can't believe it

234
00:09:19,320 --> 00:09:23,320
A few years ago, I made your dream come
true

235
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:27,320
Did you hear that?

236
00:09:27,320 --> 00:09:28,320
I did

237
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:29,320
Did you hear that?

238
00:09:29,320 --> 00:09:30,320
I did

239
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:32,320
I'm so happy

240
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:37,200
They make me happy

241
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:38,200
The girls of K-POP

242
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:40,200
Funky girl

243
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:43,200
I wanted to wear sunglasses

244
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:44,200
I have something

245
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:46,200
Yes, you have

246
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:47,200
I have

247
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:48,200
I put it on

248
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:50,200
Look at my face

249
00:09:50,200 --> 00:09:52,200
Your face looks great

250
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:56,200
I'm going out

251
00:09:56,200 --> 00:09:57,200
I'm going out

252
00:09:57,200 --> 00:09:59,200
I'm walking in the city
