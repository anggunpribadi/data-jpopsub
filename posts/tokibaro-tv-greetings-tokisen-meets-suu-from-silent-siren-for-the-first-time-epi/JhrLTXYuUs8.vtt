00:00.000 --> 00:06.000
 Rock on to Su-san's heart! We are CHO!
Tokimeki-Sendem!

00:06.000 --> 00:08.000
 Nice to meet you!

00:08.000 --> 00:10.000
 I'm so happy!

00:10.000 --> 00:12.000
 I'm happy too!

00:12.000 --> 00:15.000
 I'm Su from Silent Siren. Nice to meet
you!

00:15.000 --> 00:18.000
 Nice to meet you!

00:18.000 --> 00:19.000
 Thank you!

00:19.000 --> 00:22.000
 It feels like a feast.

00:22.000 --> 00:25.000
 Everyone watching the Toki-Sen Rock On
channel!

00:25.000 --> 00:29.000
 Hello! Nice to meet you! I'm Su from
Silent Siren's vocal guitar!

00:29.000 --> 00:32.000
 I'm Su from Silent Siren's vocal
guitar!

00:32.000 --> 00:36.538
 I can't stop this feeling!

00:36.538 --> 00:42.538
 I made a song called LOVE.

00:42.538 --> 00:52.538
 I chose the words that would be cute if
these girls sang and sang these words.

00:52.538 --> 01:01.538
 I chose the words while imagining the
part that was pulled out by the monitor
during the live performance.

01:01.538 --> 01:09.538
 I made it a song that could be loved by
fans.

01:09.538 --> 01:15.538
 I made a lot of words called LOVE and
wrote the lyrics.

01:15.538 --> 01:18.538
 It's really cute.

01:18.538 --> 01:20.538
 I can't express it.

01:20.538 --> 01:22.538
 The cuteness and purity.

01:22.538 --> 01:31.538
 It's pink. It's a song full of love.

01:31.538 --> 01:34.538
 It's fun to sing live.

01:34.538 --> 01:38.538
 I got a call in me.

01:38.538 --> 01:40.538
 Like this.

01:41.538 --> 01:43.538
 Is it a hint?

01:43.538 --> 01:46.640
 My favorite part is...

01:46.640 --> 01:48.640
 No one is with me right now.

01:50.168 --> 01:56.168
 I like this kind of song.

01:56.168 --> 02:01.168
 I think it will be exciting with the PR
manager.

02:01.168 --> 02:04.168
 So, please look forward to it.

02:05.168 --> 02:10.168
 When I hear this song, my heart will be
full of tears.

02:12.168 --> 02:13.168
 I'll give it back to you.

02:14.168 --> 02:18.168
 It's a good song that makes me feel
excited.

02:18.168 --> 02:20.168
 Please look forward to it.

02:21.168 --> 02:27.168
 I can't decide which lyrics are my
favorite.

02:27.168 --> 02:30.168
 It's a very cute lyrics.

02:31.168 --> 02:32.168
 I like that part.

02:32.168 --> 02:34.168
 You laugh like this.

02:35.168 --> 02:39.168
 I've never heard the word like this.

02:40.168 --> 02:41.168
 I'm like this.

02:42.168 --> 02:45.168
 I think it's a wonderful lyrics.

02:45.168 --> 02:48.168
 I want you to listen to it soon.

02:51.960 --> 02:52.960
 What?

02:52.960 --> 02:53.960
 Something...

02:53.960 --> 02:54.960
 Go ahead.

02:54.960 --> 02:56.960
 You can go this way.

02:56.960 --> 02:57.960
 Oh, this way.

02:57.960 --> 02:58.960
 I'm going.

02:59.960 --> 03:00.960
 Is it love?

03:00.960 --> 03:01.960
 No, it's not.

03:01.960 --> 03:03.600
 What's wrong?

03:03.600 --> 03:05.600
 How many times have I said love?

03:06.600 --> 03:08.600
 Thank you!

03:09.600 --> 03:13.600
 I sang with a lot of effort.

03:14.600 --> 03:16.600
 When I was talking, I said,

03:16.600 --> 03:18.600
 I've never seen anyone say,

03:18.600 --> 03:20.600
 I'm in love.

03:20.600 --> 03:22.600
 I used to say,

03:22.600 --> 03:25.600
 I shouldn't have spilled a little bit.

03:25.600 --> 03:27.600
 I shouldn't have spilled a little bit.

03:27.600 --> 03:31.600
 I was singing alone in a small room.

03:31.600 --> 03:33.600
 Maybe it's a good thing.

03:33.600 --> 03:35.600
 This song.

03:35.600 --> 03:38.600
 I sang alone.

03:38.600 --> 03:40.600
 Thank you!

03:40.600 --> 03:42.600
 Hello, everyone.

03:42.600 --> 03:44.600
 I'm Sui of Silent Silent.

03:44.600 --> 03:49.600
 I was really happy to get this offer.

03:49.600 --> 03:55.600
 And I got an image of this kind of
thing.

03:55.600 --> 03:58.600
 I was really happy about that.

03:58.600 --> 04:01.600
 I was able to write lyrics with fun.

04:01.600 --> 04:04.600
 I'm going to finish this recording.

04:04.600 --> 04:07.600
 I'm looking forward to seeing this song
live.

04:07.600 --> 04:12.600
 I'm looking forward to delivering it to
everyone.

04:12.600 --> 04:15.600
 Please look forward to it.

04:15.600 --> 04:19.600
 The recording was already really cute.

04:19.600 --> 04:21.600
 It's the best.

04:21.600 --> 04:23.600
 Please look forward to it.

04:23.600 --> 04:25.600
 Thank you!

04:25.600 --> 04:26.600
 Really?

04:26.600 --> 04:29.600
 I've been watching your Instagram.

04:29.600 --> 04:32.600
 I was really looking forward to it.

04:32.600 --> 04:34.600
 I was thinking,

04:34.600 --> 04:38.600
 I was doing a song with a songwriter.

04:38.600 --> 04:40.600
 I thought it was a really good song.

04:40.600 --> 04:51.450
 I thought it was unfair.

04:51.450 --> 05:17.104
 Please subscribe to my channel!

05:17.104 --> 05:19.504

05:21.404 --> 05:26.204

05:26.204 --> 05:27.004
