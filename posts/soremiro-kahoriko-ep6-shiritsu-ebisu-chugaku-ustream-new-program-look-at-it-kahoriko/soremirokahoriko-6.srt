00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,000
Please subscribe to my channel!

2
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:24,032
Look at my sleeves!

3
00:00:24,032 --> 00:00:26,832
Kaho-chan! Kaho-chan! Kaho-chan!

4
00:00:26,832 --> 00:00:28,632
I'm not in a hurry!

5
00:00:28,632 --> 00:00:33,432
Because today is our first Kamburi show!

6
00:00:33,832 --> 00:00:35,232
I'm not in a hurry...

7
00:00:36,032 --> 00:00:37,032
The last episode?

8
00:00:37,832 --> 00:00:38,832
Let's go!

9
00:00:38,832 --> 00:00:40,232
Let's go!

10
00:00:43,032 --> 00:00:43,832
No!

11
00:00:43,832 --> 00:00:46,632
I don't want to end it!

12
00:00:46,632 --> 00:00:48,432
I don't want to end it either.

13
00:00:48,432 --> 00:00:54,016
What should I do?

14
00:00:54,016 --> 00:00:56,016
This is...

15
00:00:57,016 --> 00:01:02,016
But this is the same as last time.

16
00:01:03,016 --> 00:01:08,016
That's not true.

17
00:01:09,016 --> 00:00:56,016
It's because of the

18
00:01:10,016 --> 00:01:14,016
drawing.

19
00:01:14,016 --> 00:01:23,016
One, two, three, four.

20
00:01:27,194 --> 00:01:31,194
Sit down.

21
00:01:32,194 --> 00:01:36,194
That's right.

22
00:01:36,194 --> 00:01:59,194
Sit down.

23
00:01:59,514 --> 00:02:04,514
Something is wrong.

24
00:02:04,514 --> 00:02:07,514
Something is wrong.

25
00:02:10,514 --> 00:02:15,514
What is it?

26
00:02:15,514 --> 00:02:25,050
Something is wrong.

27
00:02:25,050 --> 00:02:29,050
Hey, it's good.

28
00:02:29,050 --> 00:02:31,050
It's good.

29
00:02:31,050 --> 00:02:32,050
Huh?

30
00:02:32,050 --> 00:02:33,050
My mouth is moving.

31
00:02:33,050 --> 00:02:35,050
It's good.

32
00:02:35,050 --> 00:02:37,050
Is it good?

33
00:02:37,050 --> 00:02:38,050
It's good.

34
00:02:38,050 --> 00:02:40,050
It's good.

35
00:02:40,050 --> 00:02:49,466
It's good.

36
00:02:49,466 --> 00:02:51,466
Do you want to eat?

37
00:02:51,466 --> 00:02:53,466
Rit, do you want to eat?

38
00:02:55,466 --> 00:02:57,466
I ate a little bit.

39
00:02:57,466 --> 00:02:59,466
You're laughing, but you're right.

40
00:02:59,466 --> 00:03:01,466
Do you want to eat?

41
00:03:01,466 --> 00:03:03,466
Eat slowly.

42
00:03:03,466 --> 00:03:05,466
I ate it!

43
00:03:05,466 --> 00:03:07,466
You ate it!

44
00:03:07,466 --> 00:03:09,466
Do you want to eat more?

45
00:03:09,466 --> 00:03:11,466
I ate it!

46
00:03:11,466 --> 00:03:13,466
It moved!

47
00:03:13,466 --> 00:03:15,466
Do you want to eat?

48
00:03:15,466 --> 00:03:16,816
I'm sorry.

49
00:03:16,816 --> 00:03:17,816
Is it good?

50
00:03:17,816 --> 00:03:30,096
I'm sorry.

51
00:03:30,096 --> 00:03:32,096
You laughed.

52
00:03:42,096 --> 00:03:44,096
No, don't do that.

53
00:03:48,096 --> 00:03:50,096
It's good.

54
00:03:54,096 --> 00:03:56,096
Did you stop for a while?

55
00:03:56,096 --> 00:04:00,096
I'm not sure if I should move.

56
00:04:00,096 --> 00:04:02,096
It's hard.

57
00:04:02,096 --> 00:04:10,704
That's what I'm talking about.

58
00:04:10,704 --> 00:04:13,704
Okay, thank you for watching.

59
00:04:13,704 --> 00:04:17,840
Today's guest is...

60
00:04:17,840 --> 00:04:24,840
360 degrees, wherever you look, idol,
lucky seven, Hoshina, Mirei and...

61
00:04:24,840 --> 00:04:29,340
Yes, I'm the adult, the child, and the
number 9, Matsuha Rina.

62
00:04:29,340 --> 00:04:32,340
Thank you for having us.

63
00:04:32,340 --> 00:04:34,340
We've been waiting for you.

64
00:04:34,340 --> 00:04:35,340
We've been waiting for you.

65
00:04:35,340 --> 00:04:36,840
We've been waiting for you.

66
00:04:36,840 --> 00:04:39,340
We've been waiting for you.

67
00:04:39,340 --> 00:04:41,340
We're so glad to be here for the last
episode.

68
00:04:41,340 --> 00:04:43,340
We're so glad.

69
00:04:43,340 --> 00:04:46,340
We have to do it too.

70
00:04:46,340 --> 00:04:48,340
We have to do it too.

71
00:04:48,340 --> 00:04:53,340
I'm the first in the class, number 11,
Kobayashi Kaho.

72
00:04:53,340 --> 00:04:56,340
I'm the second in the class, number 12,
Riko Nakayama.

73
00:04:56,340 --> 00:05:02,176
Thank you.

74
00:05:02,176 --> 00:05:11,176
Solemi and Kaho, please send your
questions to social stream.

75
00:05:11,176 --> 00:05:13,176
We are waiting for your questions.

76
00:05:13,176 --> 00:05:15,176
We are waiting for your questions.

77
00:05:15,176 --> 00:05:18,176
Please send us your questions.

78
00:05:18,176 --> 00:05:20,176
Please send us your questions.

79
00:05:20,176 --> 00:05:23,264
Thank you.

80
00:05:23,264 --> 00:05:28,264
Then, in the first corner,

81
00:05:28,264 --> 00:05:33,264
Shall we bring chairs?

82
00:05:33,264 --> 00:05:36,264
Alright.

83
00:05:36,264 --> 00:05:39,264
Everyone, everyone is going?

84
00:05:39,264 --> 00:05:41,264
No, it's fine.

85
00:05:41,264 --> 00:05:42,264
Alright.

86
00:05:42,264 --> 00:05:43,264
Thank you.

87
00:05:43,264 --> 00:05:45,264
Today,

88
00:05:45,264 --> 00:05:48,264
Oh, right, before that,

89
00:05:48,264 --> 00:05:50,264
Two people.

90
00:05:50,264 --> 00:05:50,992
Thank you.

91
00:05:50,992 --> 00:05:52,992
Let's do a self-introduction.

92
00:05:52,992 --> 00:05:53,992
That's right.

93
00:05:53,992 --> 00:05:59,992
I think there are still some people in
the family who know about it.

94
00:05:59,992 --> 00:06:01,992
Then, let's do it here.

95
00:06:01,992 --> 00:06:02,992
Self-introduction.

96
00:06:02,992 --> 00:06:06,992
That's right. Let's do it because there
are still people who don't know about
it.

97
00:06:06,992 --> 00:06:07,992
That's right.

98
00:06:07,992 --> 00:06:08,992
Let's do it together.

99
00:06:09,992 --> 00:06:11,992
Where should we start?

100
00:06:11,992 --> 00:06:13,992
Let's start from the beginning.

101
00:06:13,992 --> 00:06:14,992
OK.

102
00:06:14,992 --> 00:06:17,992
Then, let's start from the beginning.

103
00:06:17,992 --> 00:06:19,248
That's right.

104
00:06:19,248 --> 00:06:21,748
My self-introduction is...

105
00:06:22,048 --> 00:06:26,448
I'm called ジャンケン, so after that, please
say ポー.

106
00:06:26,448 --> 00:06:27,448
ポー! ポー! ポー!

107
00:06:27,448 --> 00:06:31,648
And when I say, コッチ むいて, you can say
ポーちゃん.

108
00:06:31,648 --> 00:06:33,648
ポーちゃん! ポーちゃん!

109
00:06:33,648 --> 00:06:36,648
Okay, then, everyone, please say ジャンケン.

110
00:06:36,648 --> 00:06:37,148
Okay.

111
00:06:37,448 --> 00:06:39,848
Ready, set, ジャンケン! ポー!

112
00:06:39,848 --> 00:06:41,248
アッチ むいて! ポー!

113
00:06:41,248 --> 00:06:42,648
ジャンケン! ポー!

114
00:06:42,648 --> 00:06:44,720
コッチ むいて! ポーちゃん!

115
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:46,720
Thank you.

116
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:51,220
I'm the singer and the dancer, number
11, Koba Yoshikawa.

117
00:06:51,220 --> 00:06:52,720
Nice to meet you.

118
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:54,720
Yay!

119
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:59,720
Next, I'll introduce myself.

120
00:06:59,720 --> 00:07:02,720
Everyone, please follow me.

121
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:05,720
Let's do this together.

122
00:07:05,720 --> 00:07:10,912
Please pay attention to thegething
rapping line.

123
00:07:10,912 --> 00:07:15,912
We will turn the mic around, so please
say RITAN.

124
00:07:16,912 --> 00:07:23,912
Lastly, we will say together, so please
say EIEO.

125
00:07:24,912 --> 00:07:25,912
Let's go.

126
00:07:26,912 --> 00:07:28,912
Rikosan Sanadayoshi, let's go!

127
00:07:28,912 --> 00:07:31,912
Ready, go!

128
00:07:37,912 --> 00:07:39,912
Let's say EIEO together!

129
00:07:40,912 --> 00:07:41,912
Thank you.

130
00:07:42,912 --> 00:07:32,992
Thank you for the

131
00:07:32,992 --> 00:07:47,992
RITAN!

132
00:07:48,528 --> 00:07:53,528
I'm Riko Nakayama, the number 52 in the
class of Sasoriza.

133
00:07:53,528 --> 00:07:55,528
Nice to meet you.

134
00:07:57,528 --> 00:08:00,528
I thought of it before, but I'm also
from Sasoriza.

135
00:08:00,528 --> 00:08:02,528
We're the same.

136
00:08:02,528 --> 00:08:05,528
So I'm a middle schooler from Sasoriza.

137
00:08:05,528 --> 00:08:07,528
I'm a middle schooler from Sasoriza.

138
00:08:07,528 --> 00:08:09,528
I'm a middle schooler from Katagora.

139
00:08:09,528 --> 00:08:11,528
I'm a middle schooler from Kaniza.

140
00:08:14,528 --> 00:08:16,528
I wanted to say this.

141
00:08:16,528 --> 00:08:18,528
I thought we were the same.

142
00:08:18,528 --> 00:08:20,528
We have similar vibes.

143
00:08:20,528 --> 00:08:22,528
Really?

144
00:08:22,528 --> 00:08:24,528
We were at the handshake event
yesterday.

145
00:08:24,528 --> 00:08:26,528
We were like Mirei's sister.

146
00:08:26,528 --> 00:08:28,528
That's right!

147
00:08:28,528 --> 00:08:30,528
I'm happy.

148
00:08:30,528 --> 00:08:32,528
Kaho is

149
00:08:32,528 --> 00:08:34,528
very similar to Ayaka.

150
00:08:34,528 --> 00:08:36,528
We're the same height.

151
00:08:36,528 --> 00:08:38,528
Yeah!

152
00:08:38,528 --> 00:08:40,528
But really,

153
00:08:40,528 --> 00:08:42,528
we're similar to Ayaka.

154
00:08:42,528 --> 00:08:44,528
We are.

155
00:08:44,528 --> 00:08:46,528
You're often told that.

156
00:08:46,528 --> 00:08:48,528
We have similar vibes.

157
00:08:48,528 --> 00:08:50,528
But we have similar ways of talking.

158
00:08:50,528 --> 00:08:52,528
We're similar.

159
00:08:52,528 --> 00:08:54,528
We have similar actions.

160
00:08:54,528 --> 00:08:56,528
We have similar hands.

161
00:08:56,528 --> 00:08:58,528
Like this.

162
00:09:00,528 --> 00:09:02,528
We have similar faces.

163
00:09:02,528 --> 00:09:04,528
We have similar faces.

164
00:09:04,528 --> 00:09:06,528
We're similar.

165
00:09:06,528 --> 00:09:08,528
We're similar.

166
00:09:10,528 --> 00:09:12,528
Then...

167
00:09:12,528 --> 00:09:14,528
Let's eat one more.

168
00:09:14,528 --> 00:09:16,528
Let's eat one more.

169
00:09:16,528 --> 00:09:18,528
Here.

170
00:09:18,528 --> 00:09:20,528
Mirei, look at this.

171
00:09:20,528 --> 00:09:24,272
Let's eat one more.

172
00:09:24,272 --> 00:09:25,272
It looks delicious.

173
00:09:25,272 --> 00:09:26,272
What is it?

174
00:09:26,272 --> 00:09:27,272
Cookie?

175
00:09:27,272 --> 00:09:29,272
Cookie and tea.

176
00:09:29,272 --> 00:09:30,272
Oh, there it is.

177
00:09:30,272 --> 00:09:31,272
Thank you.

178
00:09:31,272 --> 00:09:33,272
It's tea.

179
00:09:34,272 --> 00:09:35,272
It's tea.

180
00:09:35,272 --> 00:09:36,272
It's relaxing.

181
00:09:36,272 --> 00:09:38,272
Where is the center?

182
00:09:38,272 --> 00:09:39,272
Here?

183
00:09:39,272 --> 00:09:41,272
The center is off.

184
00:09:41,272 --> 00:09:42,272
Where?

185
00:09:42,272 --> 00:09:45,272
This is amazing.

186
00:09:45,272 --> 00:09:46,272
This research center.

187
00:09:46,272 --> 00:09:47,272
It's amazing.

188
00:09:47,272 --> 00:09:48,272
Right?

189
00:09:48,272 --> 00:09:49,272
It's amazing.

190
00:09:49,272 --> 00:09:50,272
Where is it?

191
00:09:50,272 --> 00:09:51,272
How do you sit?

192
00:09:51,272 --> 00:09:52,272
This is Rina.

193
00:09:52,272 --> 00:09:55,272
This is Mirei.

194
00:09:55,272 --> 00:09:56,272
Thank you.

195
00:09:56,272 --> 00:10:00,272
It's been a while since we filmed a news
show.

196
00:10:00,272 --> 00:10:01,272
It's been a while.

197
00:10:01,272 --> 00:10:03,272
I'm looking forward to it.

198
00:10:03,272 --> 00:10:04,272
I'm looking forward to it.

199
00:10:04,272 --> 00:10:05,272
I'm glad.

200
00:10:07,272 --> 00:10:08,272
We have questions.

201
00:10:08,272 --> 00:10:09,272
Yes.

202
00:10:09,272 --> 00:10:11,272
Are they coming?

203
00:10:11,272 --> 00:10:12,272
Are they coming?

204
00:10:12,272 --> 00:10:13,272
They're coming.

205
00:10:13,272 --> 00:10:14,272
Have a good time.

206
00:10:14,272 --> 00:10:17,272
I'll make some tea.

207
00:10:17,272 --> 00:10:18,272
Thank you.

208
00:10:18,272 --> 00:10:19,272
You're welcome.

209
00:10:19,272 --> 00:10:20,272
Thank you.

210
00:10:20,272 --> 00:10:21,272
It looks delicious.

211
00:10:21,272 --> 00:10:22,272
It looks delicious.

212
00:10:22,272 --> 00:10:23,272
I want more.

213
00:10:23,272 --> 00:10:25,272
This cup and this cup are different.

214
00:10:25,272 --> 00:10:27,272
It's like a Japanese style.

215
00:10:27,272 --> 00:10:29,272
It's like a Japanese style.

216
00:10:31,272 --> 00:10:32,272
It looks delicious.

217
00:10:32,272 --> 00:10:35,272
We have questions.

218
00:10:35,272 --> 00:10:37,272
The question is,

219
00:10:37,272 --> 00:10:42,272
How many songs did you master in the
song Ebi-Chun?

220
00:10:43,272 --> 00:10:45,272
How many songs?

221
00:10:45,272 --> 00:10:51,272
We did 19 songs in Osaka.

222
00:10:51,272 --> 00:10:53,272
Did you master 4 songs?

223
00:10:53,272 --> 00:10:54,272
We have 23 songs.

224
00:10:54,272 --> 00:10:56,272
We have 23 songs.

225
00:10:56,272 --> 00:10:59,272
Let's think about the songs.

226
00:11:01,272 --> 00:11:03,272
Let's do a pre-release.

227
00:11:03,272 --> 00:11:06,272
Sakurago Round.

228
00:11:08,272 --> 00:11:09,272
Sorry, Matsuno.

229
00:11:09,272 --> 00:11:11,272
I'm not going to do this alone.

230
00:11:11,272 --> 00:11:12,272
Matsuno, can you do it?

231
00:11:12,272 --> 00:11:13,272
I can.

232
00:11:13,272 --> 00:11:16,272
Then eat a lot of corn cookies instead.

233
00:11:16,272 --> 00:11:18,272
Thank you.

234
00:11:18,272 --> 00:11:19,272
Are you okay?

235
00:11:19,272 --> 00:11:20,272
I'm okay.

236
00:11:20,272 --> 00:11:21,272
I'm spilling a lot.

237
00:11:21,272 --> 00:11:22,272
Thank you, Rina.

238
00:11:22,272 --> 00:11:23,272
Thank you.

239
00:11:23,272 --> 00:11:25,272
Let's count.

240
00:11:28,272 --> 00:11:29,272
We did 25 songs.

241
00:11:29,272 --> 00:11:32,272
We did Battle Royale Fect.

242
00:11:34,272 --> 00:11:36,272
25 songs?

243
00:11:36,272 --> 00:11:37,272
Yes.

244
00:11:37,272 --> 00:11:40,272
We did Rock Lee.

245
00:11:41,272 --> 00:11:42,272
We did a lot of songs.

246
00:11:42,272 --> 00:11:44,272
We did 20 songs.

247
00:11:44,272 --> 00:11:46,272
We did Kori Kenyaku Ebizori.

248
00:11:46,272 --> 00:11:49,272
We did Pakuchi.

249
00:11:49,272 --> 00:11:52,272
We did Odorogari Benjuu.

250
00:11:52,272 --> 00:11:55,272
We did a lot of songs.

251
00:11:55,272 --> 00:11:57,272
We did 25 songs.

252
00:11:57,272 --> 00:11:59,272
That's amazing.

253
00:12:00,272 --> 00:12:03,272
It's amazing that we can do so many
songs in a short time.

254
00:12:03,272 --> 00:12:04,272
We can be full of energy.

255
00:12:04,272 --> 00:12:07,272
I don't think I can do it either.

256
00:12:07,272 --> 00:12:08,272
That's right.

257
00:12:08,272 --> 00:12:10,272
That's amazing.

258
00:12:10,272 --> 00:12:12,272
Let's go.

259
00:12:12,272 --> 00:12:27,272
The announcement of the tour DVD
Everything Point 2 that was announced at
the sub-bill meeting the other day and
the pattern of the tour Osaka on the
first day and yesterday Kanazawa.

260
00:12:27,272 --> 00:12:28,272
Here it is.

261
00:12:28,272 --> 00:12:29,272
Please.

262
00:12:29,272 --> 00:12:35,322
It's fast.

263
00:12:35,322 --> 00:12:38,322
Where are we going? I want to eat!

264
00:12:38,322 --> 00:12:39,322
What?

265
00:12:39,322 --> 00:12:41,322
Let's eat!

266
00:12:41,322 --> 00:12:42,322
I can't eat!

267
00:12:42,322 --> 00:12:43,322
We are ABiTU!

268
00:12:43,322 --> 00:12:44,322
Let's go to the concert!

269
00:12:44,322 --> 00:12:45,322
ABiTU!

270
00:12:45,322 --> 00:12:57,936
Fighting!

271
00:12:57,936 --> 00:13:00,936
The first day of the school.

272
00:13:04,936 --> 00:13:07,936
This is the place where the real thing
starts.

273
00:13:08,936 --> 00:13:09,936
Pocky and human.

274
00:13:09,936 --> 00:13:11,936
Pocky and shrimp head.

275
00:13:12,936 --> 00:13:13,936
Drink it.

276
00:13:13,936 --> 00:13:14,936
Drink it.

277
00:13:14,936 --> 00:13:15,936
Drink it.

278
00:13:16,936 --> 00:13:17,936
It's too sour.

279
00:13:17,936 --> 00:13:19,936
It's too sour.

280
00:13:20,936 --> 00:13:21,936
What is this?

281
00:13:21,936 --> 00:13:22,936
Is it in your head?

282
00:13:22,936 --> 00:13:23,936
It's in the Pocky.

283
00:13:24,936 --> 00:13:25,936
Come out, Pocky.

284
00:13:25,936 --> 00:13:27,936
I want to get in too.

285
00:13:27,936 --> 00:13:28,936
It's fun.

286
00:13:28,936 --> 00:13:30,936
I want to get in too.

287
00:13:30,936 --> 00:13:31,936
It's popular.

288
00:13:32,936 --> 00:13:34,936
It's hard to breathe.

289
00:13:35,936 --> 00:13:37,936
It's dangerous to get down.

290
00:13:37,936 --> 00:13:38,936
Hayate is dangerous.

291
00:13:38,936 --> 00:13:41,936
We're going to take a sexy shot
together.

292
00:13:41,936 --> 00:13:43,936
Let's get in together.

293
00:13:43,936 --> 00:13:44,936
What?

294
00:13:44,936 --> 00:13:46,936
It's impossible.

295
00:13:46,936 --> 00:13:47,936
I can do it.

296
00:13:47,936 --> 00:13:49,936
I can't.

297
00:13:49,936 --> 00:13:50,936
I can't.

298
00:13:51,936 --> 00:13:52,936
Wait.

299
00:13:52,936 --> 00:13:53,936
I can't.

300
00:13:53,936 --> 00:13:54,936
I'm scared.

301
00:13:54,936 --> 00:13:55,936
I'm scared.

302
00:14:15,936 --> 00:14:18,936
It's more fun to dance than to sing.

303
00:14:20,936 --> 00:14:21,936
That's not it.

304
00:14:21,936 --> 00:14:22,936
That's not it.

305
00:14:22,936 --> 00:14:23,936
That's not it.

306
00:14:23,936 --> 00:14:24,936
That's not it.

307
00:14:24,936 --> 00:14:26,936
It's more fun to dance than to sing.

308
00:14:26,936 --> 00:14:27,936
It's more fun.

309
00:14:30,936 --> 00:14:31,936
I'll watch.

310
00:14:31,936 --> 00:14:32,936
Okay.

311
00:14:32,936 --> 00:14:40,058
It's more fun to dance than to sing.

312
00:14:40,058 --> 00:15:01,914
Thank you for watching!

313
00:15:01,914 --> 00:15:03,914
Let's keep going

314
00:15:03,914 --> 00:15:05,914
When the wish comes true

315
00:15:05,914 --> 00:15:08,914
The memories of being born, the memories
of being loved

316
00:15:08,914 --> 00:15:11,914
My feelings are spinning, spinning,
spinning

317
00:15:11,914 --> 00:15:23,002
That's why I love you, Elfie

318
00:15:23,002 --> 00:15:28,002
I can't make you laugh, but I can't show
you my cute attitude

319
00:15:28,002 --> 00:15:34,002
My feelings spill out like rain

320
00:15:34,002 --> 00:15:34,906
When will that be?

321
00:15:34,906 --> 00:15:39,906
I'm not a blue, but my feelings are not
always honest

322
00:15:39,906 --> 00:15:44,906
I want to tell you now

323
00:15:44,906 --> 00:15:50,112
I bloom for you

324
00:15:50,112 --> 00:15:56,112
This is the bonus talk corner after the
school performance!

325
00:15:59,112 --> 00:16:07,112
There are three halls in this tour, but
we will do this corner in that hall.

326
00:16:07,112 --> 00:16:17,112
Since we couldn't do a free talk during
the live, let's have fun here!

327
00:16:17,296 --> 00:16:24,296
What do you want to eat when you go to
Osaka?

328
00:16:26,296 --> 00:16:29,296
There are a lot of delicious food in
Osaka!

329
00:16:29,296 --> 00:16:33,296
Takoyaki, dojo, okonomiyaki, pork!

330
00:16:35,296 --> 00:16:37,296
What do you want to eat?

331
00:16:37,296 --> 00:16:40,296
Takoyaki, I guess!

332
00:16:42,296 --> 00:16:44,296
What do you want to eat?

333
00:16:44,296 --> 00:16:48,296
I guess I'll have an ice-doc again!

334
00:16:49,296 --> 00:16:51,296
What do you want to eat?

335
00:16:52,296 --> 00:16:56,296
Since we're in Osaka, I'll have
takoyaki!

336
00:16:58,296 --> 00:17:00,296
What about you, Mirei?

337
00:17:00,296 --> 00:17:03,296
I'll have kushikatsu!

338
00:17:04,296 --> 00:17:06,296
What about you, Aya-chan?

339
00:17:07,296 --> 00:17:09,296
Aya-chan, are you going to say it all?

340
00:17:09,296 --> 00:17:12,296
Aya-chan, what about you?

341
00:17:12,296 --> 00:17:16,296
I guess I'll have an egg!

342
00:17:19,296 --> 00:17:21,296
What about you, Rika?

343
00:17:22,296 --> 00:17:27,296
I guess I'll have okonomiyaki!

344
00:17:27,296 --> 00:17:30,296
What about you, Ayaka?

345
00:17:30,296 --> 00:17:37,424
I guess I'll have takoyaki!

346
00:17:37,424 --> 00:17:39,424
I got it!

347
00:17:58,810 --> 00:18:02,810
Let's do our best for our free live
debut!

348
00:18:02,810 --> 00:18:04,810
We're going to be the best!

349
00:18:04,810 --> 00:18:10,810
We are the best!

350
00:18:10,810 --> 00:18:14,810
We are the best!

351
00:18:14,810 --> 00:18:16,810
We are the best!

352
00:18:16,810 --> 00:18:22,810
We are the best!

353
00:18:22,810 --> 00:18:26,778
We are the best!

354
00:18:26,778 --> 00:18:32,378
I'm looking for a girl who's perfect for
a princess!

355
00:18:32,378 --> 00:18:34,778
Prince, that's only me!

356
00:18:34,778 --> 00:18:37,578
Please make a contract with me!

357
00:18:37,578 --> 00:18:38,978
Please make a contract!

358
00:18:38,978 --> 00:18:40,378
Please make a contract!

It was fun yesterday.

374
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:08,240
It was fun.

375
00:19:08,240 --> 00:19:10,240
It was our first time at AkiSky.

376
00:19:10,240 --> 00:19:13,240
It was our first time at a live show
outside.

377
00:19:13,240 --> 00:19:15,240
It was amazing.

378
00:19:15,240 --> 00:19:17,240
What was it?

379
00:19:17,240 --> 00:19:20,240
We talked a lot with the fans.

380
00:19:20,240 --> 00:19:24,240
Me and Aika and Kaho were in the same
room.

381
00:19:24,240 --> 00:19:27,240
Kaho looked really happy.

382
00:19:27,240 --> 00:19:29,240
Aika and I were like,

383
00:19:29,240 --> 00:19:31,240
Kaho is amazing.

384
00:19:31,240 --> 00:19:35,240
It was our first time, so we were
nervous.

385
00:19:35,240 --> 00:19:39,240
But everyone was saying it was fun.

386
00:19:39,240 --> 00:19:41,240
It was fun.

387
00:19:41,240 --> 00:19:43,240
There were only people who couldn't do
it.

388
00:19:43,240 --> 00:19:45,240
It was fun.

389
00:19:45,240 --> 00:19:47,240
It was amazing.

390
00:19:47,240 --> 00:19:50,240
Next to me was Aika.

391
00:19:50,240 --> 00:19:53,240
I was with the fans at the end.

392
00:19:53,240 --> 00:19:55,240
I said, A-A-O.

393
00:19:55,240 --> 00:19:57,240
When I went to Aika, she said, A-A-O.

394
00:19:57,240 --> 00:19:59,240
We were doing it together.

395
00:19:59,240 --> 00:20:01,240
We were imitating her.

396
00:20:01,240 --> 00:20:05,240
I had to say, don't imitate me.

397
00:20:07,240 --> 00:20:10,240
A-A-O is that.

398
00:20:10,240 --> 00:20:13,240
It started from the show.

399
00:20:13,240 --> 00:20:16,240
Now it's Rikuo's theme.

400
00:20:16,240 --> 00:20:18,240
When we were at AkiSky,

401
00:20:18,240 --> 00:20:21,240
we were told to do it together.

402
00:20:21,240 --> 00:20:23,240
Did you do it properly?

403
00:20:23,240 --> 00:20:24,240
I did.

404
00:20:24,240 --> 00:20:27,240
When we were doing it, Aika was next to
me.

405
00:20:27,240 --> 00:20:29,240
I'm glad.

406
00:20:29,240 --> 00:20:31,240
I'm glad.

407
00:20:33,240 --> 00:20:38,240
You guys were divided into groups on the
same day.

408
00:20:38,240 --> 00:20:40,240
Yes.

409
00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:43,240
I was the rock-paper-scissors.

410
00:20:43,240 --> 00:20:45,240
Really?

411
00:20:45,240 --> 00:20:48,240
Now we're just randomly deciding.

412
00:20:48,240 --> 00:20:51,240
It's fun to see who you're with.

413
00:20:51,240 --> 00:20:53,240
It's fun.

414
00:20:53,240 --> 00:20:55,240
The places are different.

415
00:20:55,240 --> 00:20:59,240
The places we stand on are fun.

416
00:20:59,240 --> 00:21:01,240
It's nice outside.

417
00:21:01,240 --> 00:21:02,240
It felt good.

418
00:21:02,240 --> 00:21:04,240
It rained a little.

419
00:21:04,240 --> 00:21:06,240
It felt good.

420
00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:08,240
Did you stop when it started?

421
00:21:08,240 --> 00:21:09,680
I stopped.

422
00:21:09,680 --> 00:21:11,680
It was raining.

423
00:21:11,680 --> 00:21:13,680
It was raining when we were in the
middle of the school.

424
00:21:13,680 --> 00:21:15,680
We were in the middle of the school.

425
00:21:15,680 --> 00:21:19,680
Riko-chan was always behind me.

426
00:21:19,680 --> 00:21:21,680
She was always like, what is that?

427
00:21:21,680 --> 00:21:23,680
What is that?

428
00:21:25,680 --> 00:21:27,680
Kanazawa-ji.

429
00:21:27,680 --> 00:21:29,680
She taught me.

430
00:21:29,680 --> 00:21:31,680
I wanted to go there.

431
00:21:31,680 --> 00:21:35,680
I want to go there again if I have the
chance.

432
00:21:35,680 --> 00:21:37,680
We went there a year ago.

433
00:21:37,680 --> 00:21:39,280
But at that time...

434
00:21:39,280 --> 00:21:44,280
There was a big park nearby.

435
00:21:44,280 --> 00:21:46,280
It was like a garden.

436
00:21:46,280 --> 00:21:49,280
We went there to play.

437
00:21:49,280 --> 00:21:52,280
It was sunny so we went there.

438
00:21:52,280 --> 00:21:55,280
We played in the ball at the school.

439
00:21:55,280 --> 00:21:57,280
We played.

440
00:21:57,280 --> 00:21:59,280
We played in the ball.

441
00:21:59,280 --> 00:22:01,280
I had fun.

442
00:22:01,280 --> 00:22:04,280
We were talking.

443
00:22:04,280 --> 00:22:04,624
I wanted to finger flick ShikiAI!

444
00:22:04,624 --> 00:22:09,624
I thought the ball would come to my
face, but it came to someone else.

445
00:22:09,624 --> 00:22:11,624
It was fun.

446
00:22:11,624 --> 00:22:16,624
Me, Rina, Ayaka, and Mayuma were
watching anime on our phones.

447
00:22:16,624 --> 00:22:19,624
We were really focused.

448
00:22:19,624 --> 00:22:22,736
We were really focused.

449
00:22:22,736 --> 00:22:24,736
We were watching it on the bus.

450
00:22:24,736 --> 00:22:26,736
We were watching it on the bus.

451
00:22:26,736 --> 00:22:28,736
We weren't done yet.

452
00:22:28,736 --> 00:22:30,736
We were watching it like this.

453
00:22:30,736 --> 00:22:32,736
Ayaka and Rina fell asleep right away.

454
00:22:32,736 --> 00:22:34,736
We didn't notice it at all.

455
00:22:34,736 --> 00:22:36,736
We were on the bus and we were on for
about 2 minutes.

456
00:22:36,736 --> 00:22:38,736
We were watching it for a little longer.

457
00:22:38,736 --> 00:22:40,736
We were watching it for a little longer.

458
00:22:40,736 --> 00:22:44,736
We definitely watched the first episode
until the end.

459
00:22:44,736 --> 00:22:46,736
We were watching it for the first
episode.

460
00:22:46,736 --> 00:22:49,736
We watched one episode.

461
00:22:49,736 --> 00:22:50,048
We watched it for the first episode
until the end.

462
00:22:50,048 --> 00:22:53,328
We watched until the second half.

463
00:22:53,328 --> 00:22:58,328
We said we'd watch it together.

464
00:22:58,328 --> 00:23:00,328
Maemon fell asleep too.

465
00:23:00,328 --> 00:23:04,048
I was like, what? I was like, I'm not
going to do it alone.

466
00:23:04,048 --> 00:23:06,048
I didn't know that.

467
00:23:06,048 --> 00:23:09,048
That happened in the back seat.

468
00:23:09,048 --> 00:23:13,048
Everyone was trying to survive.

469
00:23:13,048 --> 00:23:15,048
It was a sad tour.

470
00:23:15,048 --> 00:23:17,048
It was a sad tour.

471
00:23:17,048 --> 00:23:19,712
Next episode is going to be a perfect
one.

472
00:23:19,712 --> 00:23:21,712
I don't want to do that.

473
00:23:21,712 --> 00:23:26,712
You guys have done a lot of live shows.

474
00:23:26,712 --> 00:23:29,712
And you did a free live show.

475
00:23:29,712 --> 00:23:31,712
ZEPP is a live house.

476
00:23:31,712 --> 00:23:34,712
What is a live house?

477
00:23:34,712 --> 00:23:40,712
It's where people are having fun.

478
00:23:40,712 --> 00:23:42,712
And they cheer for us.

479
00:23:42,712 --> 00:23:47,712
It's like the one I imagined.

480
00:23:47,712 --> 00:23:49,312
It's amazing.

481
00:23:49,312 --> 00:23:52,312
I can feel everyone's passion and power.

482
00:23:52,312 --> 00:23:54,312
I'm looking forward to it.

483
00:23:54,312 --> 00:23:56,312
It's my first time on a jet ski.

484
00:23:56,312 --> 00:23:58,312
It's a double-deck.

485
00:23:58,312 --> 00:24:00,312
It's a double-deck.

486
00:24:03,312 --> 00:24:05,312
There are various songs.

487
00:24:05,312 --> 00:24:07,312
There are various changes.

488
00:24:07,312 --> 00:24:09,312
So we have a question.

489
00:24:09,312 --> 00:24:11,312
Here it is.

490
00:24:11,312 --> 00:24:17,056
Sorry. There are many.

491
00:24:17,056 --> 00:24:22,056
What is your favorite dance part in
Butterfly Effect?

492
00:24:22,056 --> 00:24:23,056
Dance part?

493
00:24:23,056 --> 00:24:24,056
Where is it?

494
00:24:24,056 --> 00:24:26,056
Do you want to announce one by one?

495
00:24:26,056 --> 00:24:27,056
Where is it?

496
00:24:27,056 --> 00:24:29,056
Let's start with Kaho.

497
00:24:29,056 --> 00:24:31,056
Dance choreography.

498
00:24:31,056 --> 00:24:35,056
I like the beginning of the song.

499
00:24:35,056 --> 00:24:41,056
I like the part where everyone is
beautiful.

500
00:24:42,056 --> 00:24:44,056
What is your favorite part?

501
00:24:44,064 --> 00:24:52,484
I like the last part of the song.

502
00:24:52,484 --> 00:24:54,644
That's cool.

503
00:24:54,644 --> 00:24:55,984
What about you, Ui-chan?

504
00:24:55,984 --> 00:24:57,984
I don't know.

505
00:24:57,984 --> 00:25:05,624
I like the dance because it's very
unique.

506
00:25:05,624 --> 00:25:12,324
I like the part where I can't go back to
the same story.

507
00:25:12,324 --> 00:25:12,464
What is your favorite part?

508
00:25:12,464 --> 00:25:13,464
Riko?

509
00:25:13,464 --> 00:25:16,464
I like the part where she goes like
this.

510
00:25:16,464 --> 00:25:18,464
The butterfly.

511
00:25:20,464 --> 00:25:21,464
That part is good.

512
00:25:21,464 --> 00:25:23,464
There are so many parts.

513
00:25:23,464 --> 00:25:25,464
It's cool.

514
00:25:25,464 --> 00:25:27,464
I like the impression of the song.

515
00:25:28,464 --> 00:25:30,464
Let's do it together.

516
00:25:30,464 --> 00:25:32,464
Let's do it together.

517
00:25:32,464 --> 00:25:34,464
Let's do it together.

518
00:25:34,464 --> 00:25:35,464
It's different.

519
00:25:35,464 --> 00:25:37,464
Let's do it together.

520
00:25:37,464 --> 00:25:38,544
Let's do it together.

521
00:25:38,544 --> 00:25:51,544
Let's do it together. together.

522
00:25:51,808 --> 00:25:56,808
Which one? This one?

523
00:25:56,808 --> 00:25:58,808
This one is successful!

524
00:26:00,808 --> 00:26:02,808
Ah, this one too!

525
00:26:02,808 --> 00:26:04,808
Ah, this one is the opposite!

526
00:26:07,808 --> 00:26:09,808
It's successful!

527
00:26:09,808 --> 00:26:11,808
It's successful!

528
00:26:11,808 --> 00:26:14,808
Well, this one is natural.

529
00:26:14,808 --> 00:26:17,808
Well, this one is also successful.

530
00:26:17,808 --> 00:26:21,808
It's not the usual pair, but we did our
best.

531
00:26:21,808 --> 00:26:29,808
There are many interesting poses, so it
might be fun to make a pair with the
family members.

532
00:26:31,808 --> 00:26:33,808
What should I do?

533
00:26:33,808 --> 00:26:36,144
Please tell me quickly!

534
00:26:36,144 --> 00:26:41,144
We haven't been to Nagoya in the middle
of the trip.

535
00:26:41,144 --> 00:26:43,144
We haven't been to Nagoya.

536
00:26:43,144 --> 00:26:46,144
It's our first time in Kanazawa.

537
00:26:46,144 --> 00:26:49,144
We're going to a lot of places for the
first time in this tour.

538
00:26:49,144 --> 00:26:52,144
What are you looking forward to the
most?

539
00:26:52,144 --> 00:26:55,144
I'm looking forward to everything.

540
00:26:55,144 --> 00:26:59,144
I like Oita prefecture.

541
00:26:59,144 --> 00:27:04,144
There are a lot of good places in Oita
prefecture, so I like it.

542
00:27:04,144 --> 00:27:04,752
Please look forward to it!

543
00:27:04,752 --> 00:27:08,752
I want to go to Oita prefecture.

544
00:27:08,752 --> 00:27:12,752
You go to Oita after Ehime in Oita
Ebichu.

545
00:27:12,752 --> 00:27:16,752
Ehime and Oita have never been to
Ebichu.

546
00:27:16,752 --> 00:27:18,752
I'm nervous.

547
00:27:18,752 --> 00:27:20,752
Is it your first time?

548
00:27:20,752 --> 00:27:22,752
It's my first time.

549
00:27:22,752 --> 00:27:24,752
I wonder what will happen.

550
00:27:24,752 --> 00:27:26,752
Where is the Tsunau Final?

551
00:27:26,752 --> 00:27:28,752
Yokohama.

552
00:27:28,752 --> 00:27:30,752
I'm looking forward to it.

553
00:27:30,752 --> 00:27:33,664
It's my first time in Yokohama.

554
00:27:33,664 --> 00:27:35,664
Really?

555
00:27:35,664 --> 00:27:37,664
I'm going to Kanagawa prefecture.

556
00:27:37,664 --> 00:27:39,664
I'm going.

557
00:27:39,664 --> 00:27:41,664
Soccer?

558
00:27:41,664 --> 00:27:43,664
Yes.

559
00:27:43,664 --> 00:27:45,664
Tour?

560
00:27:47,664 --> 00:27:49,664
Is it okay?

561
00:27:49,664 --> 00:27:51,664
Before that, I'll ask you.

562
00:27:51,664 --> 00:27:53,664
Okay.

563
00:27:53,664 --> 00:27:57,936
I'll ask you questions.

564
00:27:57,936 --> 00:27:59,936
Please send us your questions.

565
00:27:59,936 --> 00:28:00,936
Please!

566
00:28:00,936 --> 00:28:02,936
Anything is fine.

567
00:28:02,936 --> 00:28:04,936
Please listen to us.

568
00:28:04,936 --> 00:28:06,936
We only have this chance.

569
00:28:06,936 --> 00:28:10,448
This is the last one.

570
00:28:10,448 --> 00:28:12,448
The last one.

571
00:28:12,448 --> 00:28:14,448
The last one.

572
00:28:14,448 --> 00:28:16,448
The tour is over.

573
00:28:16,448 --> 00:28:18,448
Then,

574
00:28:18,448 --> 00:28:20,448
there's FAMIEN.

575
00:28:22,448 --> 00:28:24,448
I watched FAMIEN on DVD.

576
00:28:24,448 --> 00:28:26,448
So I thought I'd go.

577
00:28:26,448 --> 00:28:28,448
I was looking forward to it.

578
00:28:28,448 --> 00:28:30,448
Somen, kakigoari,

579
00:28:30,448 --> 00:28:32,448
and barbeque.

580
00:28:32,448 --> 00:28:34,448
I was looking forward to it.

581
00:28:34,448 --> 00:28:36,448
I was looking forward to it.

582
00:28:36,448 --> 00:28:38,448
I wonder if I can do it this year.

583
00:28:38,448 --> 00:28:40,448
We didn't know

584
00:28:40,448 --> 00:28:42,448
if we could eat somen or barbecue.

585
00:28:42,448 --> 00:28:44,448
We didn't know.

586
00:28:44,448 --> 00:28:47,504
I said I'd go.

587
00:28:47,504 --> 00:28:49,504
I was riding in the air.

588
00:28:49,504 --> 00:28:51,504
I was like, I'm here.

589
00:28:51,504 --> 00:28:53,504
We were all in a daze.

590
00:28:55,504 --> 00:28:57,504
It was like a festival.

591
00:28:57,504 --> 00:29:16,528
There were a lot of people looking for
us. We were so happy. We were playing
with our masks on.

592
00:29:16,528 --> 00:29:18,528
We were playing with our masks on.

593
00:29:18,528 --> 00:29:20,528
That was so cute.

594
00:29:20,528 --> 00:29:22,528
We wanted to do that again.

595
00:29:22,528 --> 00:29:24,528
We used water.

596
00:29:24,528 --> 00:29:26,528
We did the watermelon thing.

597
00:29:26,528 --> 00:29:28,528
I thought it was going to be fun.

598
00:29:28,528 --> 00:29:30,688
Thank you very much for your time.

599
00:29:30,688 --> 00:29:33,688
It's not a live performance, but a
festival.

600
00:29:33,688 --> 00:29:39,688
We sing a lot, but we sing while having
a festival.

601
00:29:39,688 --> 00:29:43,688
We eat shaved ice and do that.

602
00:29:43,688 --> 00:29:45,688
I'm looking forward to it.

603
00:29:45,688 --> 00:29:47,688
I want to be an anime character.

604
00:29:47,688 --> 00:29:50,688
I'm looking forward to it.

605
00:29:50,688 --> 00:29:53,688
What should we do if we get even more?

606
00:29:53,688 --> 00:29:58,688
Last year, it was Kawaguchiko, but this
year it's Yamanaka.

607
00:29:58,688 --> 00:29:58,720
I'm looking forward to it.

608
00:29:58,720 --> 00:30:02,720
I thought you were particular about the
lake.

609
00:30:02,720 --> 00:30:06,720
There are many lakes around Yamanashi.

610
00:30:06,720 --> 00:30:11,720
I thought there was a connection.

611
00:30:12,720 --> 00:30:17,720
There is a school in Ogasuku when I was
in elementary school.

612
00:30:17,720 --> 00:30:19,720
That school was in Yamanaka High School.

613
00:30:19,720 --> 00:30:21,720
I went to Yamanaka High School every
year.

614
00:30:21,720 --> 00:30:24,720
I was very happy.

615
00:30:24,720 --> 00:30:25,520
Thank you for your viewing.

616
00:30:25,520 --> 00:30:29,520
I often went to the forest school.

617
00:30:29,520 --> 00:30:33,520
It's been a long time since I went to
the forest school.

618
00:30:33,520 --> 00:30:35,520
I see.

619
00:30:35,520 --> 00:30:39,520
What was it like?

620
00:30:39,520 --> 00:30:41,520
It was full of nature.

621
00:30:41,520 --> 00:30:46,520
There was a stick-on thing.

622
00:30:46,520 --> 00:30:49,520
I saw that for the first time in
Yamanaka.

623
00:30:49,520 --> 00:30:51,520
That's amazing.

624
00:30:51,520 --> 00:30:51,952
Thank you for your viewing.

625
00:30:51,952 --> 00:30:54,952
Didn't you play with it often?

626
00:30:54,952 --> 00:30:55,952
Yes, I did.

627
00:30:55,952 --> 00:30:56,952
It hurts a little.

628
00:30:56,952 --> 00:30:58,952
It tickles.

629
00:30:58,952 --> 00:31:02,952
I went to a mountain in my second year
of junior high school.

630
00:31:02,952 --> 00:31:03,952
You went there.

631
00:31:03,952 --> 00:31:04,952
Yes, I did.

632
00:31:04,952 --> 00:31:09,952
My friend had a bug.

633
00:31:09,952 --> 00:31:11,952
It was round.

634
00:31:11,952 --> 00:31:14,952
I thought it was an almond, so I touched
it.

635
00:31:14,952 --> 00:31:15,952
It hurts.

636
00:31:15,952 --> 00:31:16,952
Yes.

637
00:31:16,952 --> 00:31:18,952
It was a real bug.

638
00:31:18,952 --> 00:31:19,952
A real bug?

639
00:31:19,952 --> 00:31:21,088
Yes, it was a bug.

640
00:31:21,088 --> 00:31:23,088
I threw it.

641
00:31:23,088 --> 00:31:25,088
It hurts!

642
00:31:25,088 --> 00:31:27,088
It hurts, right?

643
00:31:27,088 --> 00:31:29,088
I'm looking forward to it.

644
00:31:29,088 --> 00:31:31,088
It's like shaved ice.

645
00:31:31,088 --> 00:31:33,088
It's like summer.

646
00:31:33,088 --> 00:31:35,088
It's amazing.

647
00:31:35,088 --> 00:31:37,088
Did you get a question?

648
00:31:37,088 --> 00:31:39,088
I got a question.

649
00:31:39,088 --> 00:31:41,088
I'm going to eat cookies.

650
00:31:41,088 --> 00:31:43,088
I'm going to drink it.

651
00:31:43,088 --> 00:31:45,088
What is it?

652
00:31:45,088 --> 00:31:50,048
Who do you want to form a unit with?

653
00:31:50,048 --> 00:31:52,048
I'm fine.

654
00:31:52,048 --> 00:31:54,048
I got a little bit wet.

655
00:31:54,048 --> 00:31:56,048
Are you okay?

656
00:31:56,048 --> 00:31:58,048
I'm crying.

657
00:31:58,048 --> 00:32:00,048
Are you okay?

658
00:32:00,048 --> 00:32:02,048
I'm fine.

659
00:32:02,048 --> 00:32:04,048
Who do you want to form a unit with?

660
00:32:04,048 --> 00:32:06,048
It's hard to choose.

661
00:32:08,048 --> 00:32:10,048
Are you okay?

662
00:32:10,048 --> 00:32:12,048
Did you guys already form a unit?

663
00:32:14,048 --> 00:32:16,048
Mirei and I haven't formed a unit yet.

664
00:32:16,048 --> 00:32:18,544
Really?

665
00:32:18,544 --> 00:32:20,544
Who do you think? Who do you want to
form?

666
00:32:26,104 --> 00:32:27,104
What should we do?

667
00:32:27,424 --> 00:32:30,424
I want to form a unit with Kawa-chan.

668
00:32:30,424 --> 00:32:32,424
I want to form a unit with Chuu-ni.

669
00:32:32,744 --> 00:32:35,104
Kawa-chan, you want to form a unit with
me, right?

670
00:32:35,104 --> 00:32:36,544
I don't know.

671
00:32:37,064 --> 00:32:38,064
But...

672
00:32:38,984 --> 00:32:45,104
I want to form a unit with a lot of
people.

673
00:32:45,104 --> 00:32:46,080
Yeah.

674
00:32:46,080 --> 00:32:49,080
That sounds fun too. Yeah.

675
00:32:49,080 --> 00:32:52,080
I've been pretty...

676
00:32:52,080 --> 00:32:57,080
There's been a lot of two-person groups.
Yeah, Natsu and Hoyu.

677
00:32:57,080 --> 00:32:59,080
Mizuki and Hirono.

678
00:32:59,080 --> 00:33:01,080
And Kame-sama no Yutori.

679
00:33:01,080 --> 00:33:03,080
Yeah.

680
00:33:03,080 --> 00:33:04,080
Yeah.

681
00:33:04,080 --> 00:33:07,080
There's four of us. Thank you.

682
00:33:07,080 --> 00:33:11,080
Four of us are the best.

683
00:33:11,080 --> 00:33:13,080
Yeah.

684
00:33:13,080 --> 00:33:15,808
Who do you want to form a unit with?

685
00:33:15,808 --> 00:33:17,808
Who do you think I am?

686
00:33:19,808 --> 00:33:21,808
I want to form a unit with MIRETO.

687
00:33:21,808 --> 00:33:22,808
I thought so.

688
00:33:22,808 --> 00:33:24,808
I want to form a unit with MIRETO
forever.

689
00:33:24,808 --> 00:33:25,808
I know.

690
00:33:26,808 --> 00:33:28,808
I've been saying this since the
beginning.

691
00:33:29,808 --> 00:33:31,808
I haven't been able to do it yet.

692
00:33:31,808 --> 00:33:33,808
I might be able to do it.

693
00:33:33,808 --> 00:33:35,808
Really? I want to do it.

694
00:33:35,808 --> 00:33:38,808
Rina, you were a triathlete friend for
two years in a row.

695
00:33:38,808 --> 00:33:39,808
Yeah.

696
00:33:39,808 --> 00:33:40,808
I see.

697
00:33:40,808 --> 00:33:42,808
After that, we were in the same group.

698
00:33:42,808 --> 00:33:43,392
I see.

699
00:33:43,392 --> 00:33:47,392
So you've been with me for 3 years? 確かに。

700
00:33:47,392 --> 00:33:51,392
That's amazing. でも、ユニットとかも、

701
00:33:51,392 --> 00:33:56,392
If we were to do a unit,
もし、ユニットをやるってなったら、

702
00:33:56,392 --> 00:34:00,392
I'm looking forward to it. 楽しみだな。

703
00:34:00,392 --> 00:34:05,392
I'm looking forward to it. 新しくなりそうだよね。

704
00:34:05,392 --> 00:34:09,392
The atmosphere is different from before.
今までと雰囲気みんな違うからね。

705
00:34:09,392 --> 00:34:10,576
I'm looking forward to it. 楽しみ。

706
00:34:10,576 --> 00:34:13,576
I want to do it with Kaori.
カホリコとも組んでみたいかも。

707
00:34:13,576 --> 00:34:17,576
I want to do it. この4人でも一緒に組んでもいい?

708
00:34:17,576 --> 00:34:21,576
That's good. もうそれでいいよ。

709
00:34:21,576 --> 00:34:24,576
I want to do it. やってみたいよね。

710
00:34:24,576 --> 00:34:30,480
What kind of song would you like to do?
曲はどんなのがいい?

711
00:34:30,480 --> 00:34:40,480
僕はあの曲が好きだよ。 ディアンスが好きだよ。

712
00:34:40,480 --> 00:34:45,480
私はあの曲がすごく好きなの。 本当? ありがとう。

713
00:34:45,480 --> 00:34:52,848
でもね、ミレイちゃんのね、あのあれも可愛いの好きなの。 君にサンキュー。
ありがとう。

714
00:34:52,848 --> 00:34:58,848
恥ずかしいね。 ユニット曲結構私の好きな感じの曲多くて。

715
00:34:58,848 --> 00:35:02,848
本当? ユニットの好き? でも、盛り上がる曲あるじゃん?

716
00:35:02,848 --> 00:35:09,848
でも、なんかマヨマヨのさ、あの、野月さんのね、
あれも、あれも好きだなって思って。

717
00:35:09,848 --> 00:35:13,848
かっこいいから。 かっこいいね。 マヨネットちゃんの当たり目?

718
00:35:13,848 --> 00:35:16,848
もう好きだ。 ミレイちゃんとの。 あーいいね。

719
00:35:16,848 --> 00:35:22,752
スキだね、あの曲も。

720
00:35:22,752 --> 00:35:38,752
So, we are going to play Rose Shake,
which is a song by Circle K's Sankus.

721
00:35:38,752 --> 00:35:41,936
It was released yesterday!

722
00:35:41,936 --> 00:35:44,936
I'm going to go get it.

723
00:35:44,936 --> 00:35:47,936
I'm going to go get it.

724
00:35:47,936 --> 00:35:49,936
Thank you, Riko.

725
00:35:49,936 --> 00:35:51,936
There are 3 different flavors.

726
00:35:51,936 --> 00:35:53,936
What should we do?

727
00:35:53,936 --> 00:35:55,936
It looks delicious.

728
00:35:55,936 --> 00:35:58,936
Let's start with the winner.

729
00:36:01,936 --> 00:36:04,936
I know that Mire is aiming for the same
thing.

730
00:36:04,936 --> 00:36:07,936
I'm aiming for the same thing.

731
00:36:07,936 --> 00:36:10,936
I think Riton is aiming for the same
thing.

732
00:36:10,936 --> 00:36:12,936
Let's start!

733
00:36:17,936 --> 00:36:19,936
I know what it is.

734
00:36:19,936 --> 00:36:22,936
I know what it is.

735
00:36:22,936 --> 00:36:25,936
Hurry up and take it.

736
00:36:29,936 --> 00:36:31,936
I've never had strawberry before.

737
00:36:31,936 --> 00:36:32,936
Really?

738
00:36:32,936 --> 00:36:35,936
I had it when we were shooting.

739
00:36:35,936 --> 00:36:38,936
I've never had strawberry before.

740
00:36:38,936 --> 00:36:40,936
Really?

741
00:36:40,936 --> 00:36:43,936
Maybe it's not strawberry.

742
00:36:43,936 --> 00:36:45,936
I'll give you a bite.

743
00:36:46,936 --> 00:36:48,936
It's a drum.

744
00:36:48,936 --> 00:36:50,936
Riko, you won.

745
00:36:50,936 --> 00:36:53,936
I'll take it first.

746
00:36:53,936 --> 00:36:55,936
Which one will go first?

747
00:36:55,936 --> 00:36:57,936
This one!

748
00:36:57,936 --> 00:37:00,936
I can't drink vanilla.

749
00:37:00,936 --> 00:37:02,936
Really?

750
00:37:02,936 --> 00:37:04,936
Can I have it later?

751
00:37:04,936 --> 00:37:06,936
Sure.

752
00:37:06,936 --> 00:37:14,936
Since there's something delicious,

753
00:37:14,936 --> 00:37:19,936
I want to do a food report.

754
00:37:19,936 --> 00:37:21,936
Sounds good.

755
00:37:21,936 --> 00:37:23,936
I can't do a report.

756
00:37:23,936 --> 00:37:25,936
Me neither.

757
00:37:25,936 --> 00:37:27,936
Who will go first?

758
00:37:27,936 --> 00:37:29,936
I lost.

759
00:37:29,936 --> 00:37:31,936
Let's go with Kaho.

760
00:37:31,936 --> 00:37:33,936
Let's start from the beginning.

761
00:37:33,936 --> 00:37:36,936
I'll do my best.

762
00:37:36,936 --> 00:37:42,936
Look at this delicious-looking
container.

763
00:37:42,936 --> 00:37:48,936
This cute, stylish mark.

764
00:37:48,936 --> 00:37:53,936
And this cute combination.

765
00:37:53,936 --> 00:37:55,936
I'll open it.

766
00:37:55,936 --> 00:37:58,016
Bye!

767
00:37:58,016 --> 00:38:01,416
It's vanilla flavor. It looks delicious.

768
00:38:01,416 --> 00:38:04,416
It's a very delicious fruit.

769
00:38:04,416 --> 00:38:06,916
It's a very delicious fruit.

770
00:38:06,916 --> 00:38:08,416
I'll eat it.

771
00:38:08,416 --> 00:38:10,016
Please eat it.

772
00:38:10,016 --> 00:38:11,616
Will you swallow it?

773
00:38:12,816 --> 00:38:13,616
Do your best!

774
00:38:13,616 --> 00:38:14,716
I'll eat it!

775
00:38:14,716 --> 00:38:23,066
I think it's better to let it float.

776
00:38:23,066 --> 00:38:27,066
It's delicious! This is a revolution!

777
00:38:28,066 --> 00:38:36,066
Even with the vanilla, you can drink it
forever.

778
00:38:39,066 --> 00:38:43,066
I want to drink it forever. It's a
delicious taste.

779
00:38:44,066 --> 00:38:46,066
How is it?

780
00:38:47,066 --> 00:38:48,066
How is it?

781
00:38:48,066 --> 00:38:48,608
Thank you for watching.

782
00:38:48,608 --> 00:38:52,408
It's good. Thank you.

783
00:38:52,408 --> 00:38:55,408
Riko-chan, please look.

784
00:38:55,408 --> 00:38:58,008
What is this mark?

785
00:38:58,008 --> 00:39:00,308
Isn't it a rose knife?

786
00:39:00,308 --> 00:39:07,162
Maybe...

787
00:39:07,162 --> 00:39:11,162
How does it taste?

788
00:39:11,162 --> 00:39:14,162
It's good!

789
00:39:14,162 --> 00:39:20,162
The one we had before was crispy, but
it's good even when it melts.

790
00:39:20,162 --> 00:39:24,162
You can drink it while it's hot.

791
00:39:24,162 --> 00:39:30,162
You can drink it when it's too hot.

792
00:39:30,162 --> 00:39:35,162
It gets cold even when you drink it and
warm it up.

793
00:39:35,162 --> 00:39:43,162
It's good when you mix it with the
microwave.

794
00:39:43,162 --> 00:39:47,162
It's good when it's cold.

795
00:39:47,162 --> 00:39:50,162
It's crispy and good.

796
00:39:50,162 --> 00:39:54,162
You introduced us to a good way to drink
it.

797
00:39:54,162 --> 00:39:54,944
Please subscribe to our channel.

798
00:39:54,944 --> 00:39:56,944
It's hot.

799
00:39:56,944 --> 00:39:58,944
It's good on hot days.

800
00:39:58,944 --> 00:40:00,944
Let's start with Mirei.

801
00:40:00,944 --> 00:40:02,944
Mirei!

802
00:40:02,944 --> 00:40:04,944
I don't need that.

803
00:40:04,944 --> 00:40:06,944
I know Mirei.

804
00:40:08,944 --> 00:40:10,944
In this beautiful container,

805
00:40:10,944 --> 00:40:14,944
there's this chocolate frozen.

806
00:40:14,944 --> 00:40:16,944
It looks delicious.

807
00:40:16,944 --> 00:40:18,944
The smell of chocolate is amazing.

808
00:40:18,944 --> 00:40:20,944
It is.

809
00:40:20,944 --> 00:40:24,944
Let's try it.

810
00:40:27,066 --> 00:40:37,066
It's a little sweet, but it's delicious
and hot.

811
00:40:37,066 --> 00:40:43,066
Even when I'm feeling down, it's like
it's making me feel good.

812
00:40:43,066 --> 00:40:47,066
It looks delicious.

813
00:40:49,066 --> 00:40:51,066
I'm thirsty.

814
00:40:51,066 --> 00:40:56,608
I'm going to do it after Rina.

815
00:40:56,608 --> 00:40:57,608
Rina.

816
00:40:57,608 --> 00:41:01,608
Please look at this beautiful pink.

817
00:41:01,608 --> 00:41:03,608
There's crab meat in it.

818
00:41:04,608 --> 00:41:06,608
I'm going to eat it.

819
00:41:15,608 --> 00:41:17,608
There's crab meat in it.

820
00:41:18,608 --> 00:41:20,608
There's crab meat in it.

821
00:41:21,608 --> 00:41:22,608
Amazing.

822
00:41:22,608 --> 00:41:25,120
There's crab meat in it.

823
00:41:25,120 --> 00:41:27,120
It's so good.

824
00:41:27,120 --> 00:41:29,120
It's so good.

825
00:41:29,120 --> 00:41:32,120
The strawberry is so juicy.

826
00:41:35,120 --> 00:41:37,120
It's mixed up.

827
00:41:37,120 --> 00:41:39,120
It's really good.

828
00:41:39,120 --> 00:41:41,120
It looks good.

829
00:41:41,120 --> 00:41:42,120
Is it good?

830
00:41:42,120 --> 00:41:44,120
Thank you.

831
00:41:44,120 --> 00:41:49,616
Strawberry! Strawberry! Strawberry!

832
00:41:49,616 --> 00:41:52,616
Delicious! Delicious! Delicious!

833
00:41:52,616 --> 00:41:56,616
It's delicious, isn't it?

834
00:41:56,616 --> 00:41:57,616
I'll have some too.

835
00:41:57,616 --> 00:41:59,616
Strawberry is delicious.

836
00:42:00,616 --> 00:42:01,616
Thank you.

837
00:42:03,616 --> 00:42:05,616
Strawberry is delicious.

838
00:42:05,616 --> 00:42:07,616
I've never had it before.

839
00:42:08,616 --> 00:42:10,616
The chocolate is delicious too.

840
00:42:10,616 --> 00:42:13,200
Choose the flavor you like.

841
00:42:13,200 --> 00:42:15,200
Please look for it.

842
00:42:15,200 --> 00:42:19,200
Go to the nearby Circle K Sanks.

843
00:42:22,200 --> 00:42:24,200
It became like this.

844
00:42:26,200 --> 00:42:28,200
It's delicious.

845
00:42:28,200 --> 00:42:30,200
It's very delicious.

846
00:42:31,200 --> 00:42:33,200
I've been drinking it all the time.

847
00:42:33,200 --> 00:42:38,200
I'm a little tired of time in a little
while.

848
00:42:38,200 --> 00:42:40,200
It's fast.

849
00:42:40,200 --> 00:42:42,528
It's really fast.

850
00:42:42,528 --> 00:42:44,528
It's really fast.

851
00:42:45,528 --> 00:42:48,528
It's been only a minute.

852
00:42:48,528 --> 00:42:50,528
It's started.

853
00:42:50,528 --> 00:42:52,528
It's really a short time.

854
00:42:53,528 --> 00:42:55,528
It was fun today, right?

855
00:42:55,528 --> 00:42:56,528
It was fun.

856
00:42:56,528 --> 00:42:58,528
I'm glad we came.

857
00:42:58,528 --> 00:43:00,528
Thank you for coming.

858
00:43:00,528 --> 00:43:03,528
Thank you.

859
00:43:03,528 --> 00:43:07,952
Thank you.

860
00:43:07,952 --> 00:43:10,952
We're both a little tired, but we'll do
our best.

861
00:43:10,952 --> 00:43:12,952
We'll do our best!

862
00:43:12,952 --> 00:43:16,952
We'll be waiting for you guys on tour,
too.

863
00:43:16,952 --> 00:43:17,952
Bye bye!

864
00:43:17,952 --> 00:43:19,696
See you later!

865
00:43:19,696 --> 00:43:21,696
Thank you!

866
00:43:21,696 --> 00:43:23,696
Bye bye!

867
00:43:23,696 --> 00:43:25,696
Bye bye!

868
00:43:25,696 --> 00:43:27,696
Good luck!

869
00:43:27,696 --> 00:43:29,696
Bye bye!

870
00:43:29,696 --> 00:43:31,696
Bye bye!

871
00:43:31,696 --> 00:43:33,696
Thank you!

872
00:43:33,696 --> 00:43:35,696
Thank you for coming!

873
00:43:35,696 --> 00:43:37,696
Bye bye!

874
00:43:37,696 --> 00:43:39,696
Bye bye!

875
00:43:39,696 --> 00:43:41,696
Bye bye!

876
00:43:41,696 --> 00:43:43,696
Wait!

877
00:43:43,696 --> 00:43:45,696
Don't lie!

878
00:43:45,696 --> 00:43:47,696
No, I'm not!

879
00:43:47,696 --> 00:43:49,696
How was it?

880
00:43:49,696 --> 00:43:51,696
How was it to come to the last floor?

881
00:43:51,696 --> 00:43:53,696
How was it to come to the last floor?

882
00:43:53,696 --> 00:43:55,696
How was it to come back now?

883
00:43:55,696 --> 00:43:57,696
Well,

884
00:43:57,696 --> 00:43:59,696
I think the sixth floor was

885
00:43:59,696 --> 00:44:01,536
really short.

886
00:44:01,536 --> 00:44:10,536
We spent a lot of time together, but it
was a great experience.

887
00:44:10,536 --> 00:44:16,536
I'm glad that we got along with
everyone.

888
00:44:16,536 --> 00:44:19,536
It was fun.

889
00:44:19,536 --> 00:44:21,536
What about Riko?

890
00:44:21,536 --> 00:44:29,472
I think I got to know a lot about
Kaoriko in this program.

891
00:44:29,472 --> 00:44:37,472
Thank you for coming to the program as a
guest.

892
00:44:38,472 --> 00:44:40,472
I think she's gone.

893
00:44:40,472 --> 00:44:42,472
Thank you.

894
00:44:44,472 --> 00:44:46,472
I heard your voice.

895
00:44:46,472 --> 00:44:52,512
Let's wrap up.

896
00:44:52,512 --> 00:44:59,512
Thank you for watching SoRiMi's
KahoRiKo.

897
00:44:59,512 --> 00:45:01,512
Thank you.

898
00:45:01,512 --> 00:45:05,512
This is Shiritui Bishu School, number
11, Kobayashi Kaho.

899
00:45:05,512 --> 00:45:11,808
And number 12, Nakayama Riko's SoRiMi.

900
00:45:11,808 --> 00:45:14,808
SoRiMi's Kawaii Kou!

901
00:45:14,808 --> 00:45:16,308
Bye bye!

902
00:45:16,308 --> 00:45:21,808
We'll see you again at the next SoRiMi's
SoRiMi's Kawaii Kou!

903
00:45:21,808 --> 00:45:24,808
Please!

904
00:45:24,808 --> 00:45:26,808
Please!

905
00:45:26,808 --> 00:45:30,808
Thank you for watching!

906
00:45:31,808 --> 00:45:33,808
See you on the phone!

907
00:45:33,808 --> 00:45:35,888
We'll be waiting!
