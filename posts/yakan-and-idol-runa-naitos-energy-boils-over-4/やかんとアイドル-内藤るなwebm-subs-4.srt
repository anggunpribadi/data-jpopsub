1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
The third one is Red Bull.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Red Bull?

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,000
You came here for a limited time.

4
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,000
You are famous among your fans.

5
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:11,000
Yes, I am.

6
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:13,000
I am grateful.

7
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:15,000
When I want to cheer up,

8
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:17,000
I come here.

9
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:19,000
I will come here.

10
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:21,000
I will come here.

11
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:23,000
I will come here.

12
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:25,000
I will come here.

13
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:27,000
I will come here.

14
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:29,000
I will come here.

15
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:31,000
You always go to the stage to drink.

16
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:33,000
No way.

17
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,000
You drink Red Bull, too?

18
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:37,000
You?

19
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:39,000
You are performing live.

20
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,000
Yes.

21
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,000
That's amazing.

22
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,000
You are so hot.

23
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:47,000
You don't move much and stick your
mouth.

24
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:51,000
I saw a video of a Queen.

25
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,000
I saw a video of a Queen.

26
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:55,000
I saw a video of a Queen.

27
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:57,000
I saw a video of a Queen.

28
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,000
I see.

29
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:01,000
I saw it and thought it was a good idea
to drink coke.

30
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,000
I thought it was a good idea to drink
coke.

31
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,000
I wanted to play Red Bull.

32
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:07,000
I wanted to play Red Bull.

33
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,000
I see.

34
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:13,000
I think you want to play Red Bull.

35
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,000
I love your performances.

36
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,000
I love your performances.

37
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:19,000
When you are in a bad mood,

38
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:21,000
I drink Red Bull.

39
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,000
I want to show this to you.

40
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,000
I want to show this to you.

41
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:28,000
I don't know what to do.

42
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:33,000
I think Red Bull will like something
extreme.

43
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:36,000
Something extreme.

44
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Maybe we should do a live show with
energy.

45
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:41,000
Red Bull will be happy.

46
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,000
We'll talk about it.

47
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:44,000
Talk about it?

48
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:47,000
You like Red Bull, right?

49
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:51,000
I think I sponsored it the other day.

50
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:55,000
Like coming down from the space.

51
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,000
What should I do?

52
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:04,000
I think Red Bull will like something
challenging.

53
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:08,000
I think it would be nice if the bolt was
sponsored like that.

54
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:15,000
I think it would be nice if it was an
extreme group.

55
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:21,000
Next, Naito's...

56
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,000
There's one more.

57
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,000
Sorry.

58
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:28,000
Naito's...

59
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Is there one more?

60
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:34,000
I can't hold it down.

61
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
I can't hold it down.

62
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,000
There's one more.

63
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,000
It's 3.5.

64
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:44,000
What do you like about Red Bull?

65
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
I like it when it sparkles.

66
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:49,000
What do you mean?

67
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:55,000
My dream is to be a celebrity.

68
00:02:55,000 --> 00:03:02,000
I've always liked glittering things.

69
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:06,000
It's something I can't live without.

70
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:09,000
You want to be a celebrity?

71
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,000
Yes.

72
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
Why?

73
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:15,000
I've liked it since I was little.

74
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,000
I see.

75
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:20,000
I think it's really fun.

76
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,000
It's fun, right?

77
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,000
I love it.

78
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:26,000
I'll be like that in the future.

79
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:31,000
I think Red Bull will come to that
point.

80
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,000
I think so.

81
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:43,000
I don't think Paris Hilton is ready yet.

82
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,000
I see.

83
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,000
I like it.

84
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,000
I see.

85
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
I like it.

86
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:56,000
I haven't seen anyone like that lately.

87
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:01,000
I think everyone's into it.

88
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,000
I think it's good to have everyone like
that.

89
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:06,000
I want to be the last Paris Hilton.

90
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:10,000
I'm not saying Paris Hilton.

91
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:15,000
I want everyone to spread their
reputation.

92
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:21,000
I want to be the glittering me.

93
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:24,000
What is the reason for Red Bull?

94
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:31,000
The reason for Red Bull is that they
want to be Paris Hilton.

95
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:55,000
I think so.
