1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Ebitune's video

2
00:00:06,760 --> 00:00:08,760
I'm Komae Shikamo, the 51st in the
world.

3
00:00:08,760 --> 00:00:10,760
Yes, that's why.

4
00:00:10,760 --> 00:00:12,760
It's my first time.

5
00:00:12,760 --> 00:00:14,760
I'm the leader of the Terakemono.

6
00:00:14,760 --> 00:00:17,760
Today is the day of preparation.

7
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:19,760
It's the day of the entry.

8
00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:21,760
Finally, I'm at the venue.

9
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:28,848
I'm here to prepare for the performance.

10
00:00:28,848 --> 00:00:33,848
I'm going to start right away.

11
00:00:35,848 --> 00:00:38,848
I'm entering the venue.

12
00:00:38,848 --> 00:00:58,778
I'm going to start the performance.

13
00:00:58,778 --> 00:01:06,778
I've been in quarantine for about a
year.

14
00:01:06,778 --> 00:01:12,778
I was at home because of the
coronavirus.

15
00:01:12,778 --> 00:01:15,778
It was really hard.

16
00:01:15,778 --> 00:01:21,778
For me, the quarantine period was just
right.

17
00:01:21,778 --> 00:01:27,778
I've been in quarantine for about a
year.

18
00:01:27,778 --> 00:01:37,778
If it's this size, I can wear it for
half a day.

19
00:01:37,778 --> 00:01:44,778
The big one took me a week.

20
00:01:44,778 --> 00:01:48,778
It took me a long time to make a
different one.

21
00:01:48,778 --> 00:01:54,960
I had a hard time making the draft.

22
00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:56,940
Can it be released?

23
00:01:57,018 --> 00:02:03,018
First, this is a picture called 芋たれ.

24
00:02:03,018 --> 00:02:11,018
This is a picture I took when I was in
the news.

25
00:02:11,018 --> 00:02:15,018
This is a picture of me being carried in
my stomach.

26
00:02:15,018 --> 00:02:22,018
This is a picture of me being carried in
my stomach and a picture of a person
being carried in my stomach.

27
00:02:22,018 --> 00:02:28,018
I drew this picture with my sister.

28
00:02:28,018 --> 00:02:33,018
I've been painting this picture many
times.

29
00:02:33,018 --> 00:02:43,018
I wanted to express the warmth of the
sun, which is like a human.

30
00:02:43,018 --> 00:02:48,018
I've been painting this picture many
times.

31
00:02:48,018 --> 00:02:53,018
This is the most childlike picture.

32
00:02:53,344 --> 00:02:55,088
Thank you for your viewing.

33
00:02:55,088 --> 00:03:00,088
This is a series called Shiki.

34
00:03:00,088 --> 00:03:03,088
It's a series of photos.

35
00:03:03,088 --> 00:03:07,088
It's a series of photos called Shiki.

36
00:03:07,088 --> 00:03:10,088
It's the first time I've heard of it.

37
00:03:10,088 --> 00:03:12,088
It's a series of photos of the seasons.

38
00:03:12,088 --> 00:03:15,088
It's a series of photos of spring,
summer, and autumn.

39
00:03:15,088 --> 00:03:18,088
It's a series of photos of spring,
summer, and autumn.

40
00:03:18,088 --> 00:03:26,088
I wanted to create a seasonal
atmosphere.

41
00:03:26,088 --> 00:03:30,088
The colors of cherry blossoms are
reflected in the photo.

42
00:03:30,088 --> 00:03:32,088
The colors of cherry blossoms are
reflected in the photo.

43
00:03:32,088 --> 00:03:35,088
This is a picture of the autumn leaves.

44
00:03:35,088 --> 00:03:37,088
This is a picture of the Christmas tree.

45
00:03:37,088 --> 00:03:39,088
The most beautiful picture is this.

46
00:03:39,088 --> 00:03:41,088
The most beautiful picture is this.

47
00:03:41,088 --> 00:03:44,088
I used a metallic color.

48
00:03:44,088 --> 00:03:47,552
This is a picture of the autumn leaves.

49
00:03:47,552 --> 00:03:49,552
Please look at this.

50
00:03:49,552 --> 00:03:57,552
This is a picture of a mixed animal.

51
00:03:57,552 --> 00:04:01,552
I recommend this picture.

52
00:04:01,552 --> 00:04:08,552
This is a picture of a gorilla and a
fox.

53
00:04:08,552 --> 00:04:18,552
This is the most relaxing animal of the
mixed species.

54
00:04:18,552 --> 00:04:32,552
It's like a scene in an anime.

55
00:04:32,552 --> 00:04:44,552
I want you to see this picture.

56
00:04:44,576 --> 00:04:48,576
This is my profile picture.

57
00:04:48,576 --> 00:04:53,576
I drew my profile picture.

58
00:04:53,576 --> 00:04:56,576
I was born in 2000.

59
00:04:56,576 --> 00:04:58,576
I'm a blood type A.

60
00:04:58,576 --> 00:05:03,576
I'm a Tatsudoshi.

61
00:05:03,576 --> 00:05:07,576
There are two theories.

62
00:05:07,576 --> 00:05:12,576
I drew Tatsu of Dora and Tatsu of Tatsu.

63
00:05:12,576 --> 00:05:17,576
I'm from Saitama Prefecture.

64
00:05:17,576 --> 00:05:20,576
I'm a little timid.

65
00:05:20,576 --> 00:05:23,576
I'm a little timid.

66
00:05:23,576 --> 00:05:29,576
If I were a Tatsudoshi, I would draw a
picture of a person.

67
00:05:29,576 --> 00:05:33,232
I'm a little timid.

68
00:05:33,232 --> 00:05:36,232
I'm weak, so I'm a little timid.

69
00:05:36,232 --> 00:05:39,232
I'm a little timid.

70
00:05:39,232 --> 00:05:43,232
I like dumplings.

71
00:05:43,232 --> 00:05:46,232
I like to eat dumplings.

72
00:05:46,232 --> 00:05:51,232
I wrote a song like this.

73
00:05:51,232 --> 00:05:54,232
I wrote a song like this.

74
00:05:54,232 --> 00:06:00,232
This is a picture of me in one piece.

75
00:06:00,232 --> 00:06:04,232
I wanted to introduce everything.

76
00:06:04,232 --> 00:06:08,232
This is a picture called Take Me Home.

77
00:06:08,232 --> 00:06:16,232
This is a dream I saw a lot when I was
in elementary school.

78
00:06:16,232 --> 00:06:20,232
I've been going to the hallway of
elementary school all the time.

79
00:06:20,232 --> 00:06:23,232
I've been going to the hallway of
elementary school all the time.

80
00:06:23,232 --> 00:06:29,232
I've been going to the hallway of
elementary school all the time.

81
00:06:29,232 --> 00:06:32,232
I've been looking at it for a long time.

82
00:06:32,232 --> 00:06:35,232
I wrote it.

83
00:06:35,232 --> 00:06:38,232
I wrote it.

84
00:06:38,232 --> 00:06:43,232
The pictures around me are painted.

85
00:06:43,232 --> 00:06:47,232
The pictures around me are painted.

86
00:06:47,232 --> 00:06:49,232
I'm the only one who's painted.

87
00:06:49,232 --> 00:06:54,320
I've been painting this much.

88
00:06:54,320 --> 00:06:58,820
I thought I'd float around like this.

89
00:06:58,820 --> 00:07:00,820
So I'm going to talk about my face.

90
00:07:00,820 --> 00:07:05,820
Okay, the last one is a self-portrait.

91
00:07:05,820 --> 00:07:07,328
Um.

92
00:07:07,328 --> 00:07:15,208
I don't know when this will be released,
but I took a picture with Niko
yesterday.

93
00:07:15,208 --> 00:07:28,248
I was 20 years old at the time, and I
took a picture while looking at my face.

94
00:07:28,248 --> 00:07:32,868
I was not good at drawing self-
portraits.

95
00:07:32,868 --> 00:07:36,528
It took a lot of time.

96
00:07:36,528 --> 00:07:45,328
I tried to express the skin color of the
skin by layering various colors.

97
00:07:45,328 --> 00:07:51,768
I tried to express the skin of a human.

98
00:07:51,768 --> 00:07:55,328
The color has changed now.

99
00:07:55,328 --> 00:07:57,728
I don't know.

100
00:07:57,728 --> 00:08:02,064
I don't know.

101
00:08:02,064 --> 00:08:07,564
I didn't think I'd be able to draw my
face like this.

102
00:08:07,564 --> 00:08:11,464
It's amazing. It's amazing. It's
complete. It's hard.

103
00:08:11,464 --> 00:08:14,064
Do you understand me?

104
00:08:14,064 --> 00:08:19,064
I think you'll understand. I'd like you
to see it.

105
00:08:19,064 --> 00:08:21,064
Yes, that's what I'm going to do.

106
00:08:21,064 --> 00:08:27,064
I'm going to do my first painting this
time.

107
00:08:27,064 --> 00:08:33,064
I'm actually preparing for it today.

108
00:08:33,064 --> 00:08:36,064
I'm still surprised.

109
00:08:36,064 --> 00:08:41,064
I think it'll be over soon.

110
00:08:41,064 --> 00:08:47,064
But I've always liked painting since I
was in kindergarten.

111
00:08:47,064 --> 00:08:53,064
I'm wondering how you'll react to seeing
that picture.

112
00:08:53,064 --> 00:08:57,064
I'm very curious about your reaction.

113
00:08:57,064 --> 00:09:02,064
But I'm drawing all the pictures
carefully.

114
00:09:02,064 --> 00:09:09,064
It's still a difficult situation in the
world.

115
00:09:09,064 --> 00:09:19,064
I hope people will laugh at my painting.

116
00:09:19,064 --> 00:09:30,064
I'm happy that I can do what I like with
my 20th birthday.

117
00:09:30,064 --> 00:09:36,064
I don't know what I can do next.

118
00:09:36,064 --> 00:09:42,064
I hope I can do it again someday.

119
00:09:42,064 --> 00:09:48,064
I want to improve my skills.

120
00:09:48,064 --> 00:09:54,064
Thank you very much for enjoying it.

121
00:09:54,064 --> 00:09:59,181
See you next time.
