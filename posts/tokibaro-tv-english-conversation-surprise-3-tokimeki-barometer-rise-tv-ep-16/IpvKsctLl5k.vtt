 So, next time we're transforming into
Julia and Annamie

00:15.418 --> 00:24.418
 I think she's the youngest member in
the group, but she's definitely the

01:37.992 --> 01:39.992
 I'm suspicious of you.

01:39.992 --> 01:41.992
 You did something bad.

01:41.992 --> 01:42.992
 I'm wrong.

01:42.992 --> 01:44.992
 I thought you were a good person.

01:44.992 --> 01:46.992
 I'm not good at it.

01:46.992 --> 01:47.992
 You are.

01:49.992 --> 01:51.992
 I'm using a GoPro as a PC.

01:53.992 --> 01:55.992

11:21.248 --> 11:27.248
 Only the people with a pure heart can
see this.

11:27.248 --> 11:31.248
 But if you laugh, it's weird.

11:31.248 --> 11:34.248
 Your heart may be dirty.

11:34.248 --> 11:36.248
 Is it okay?

11:36.248 --> 11:39.248
 Please wash it off with water and watch
it again.
