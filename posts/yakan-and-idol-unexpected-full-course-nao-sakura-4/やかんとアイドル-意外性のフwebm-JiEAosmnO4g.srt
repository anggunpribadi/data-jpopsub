1
00:00:00,938 --> 00:00:02,378
A night time idol.

2
00:00:05,778 --> 00:00:06,618
Thank you so much.

3
00:00:06,618 --> 00:00:11,058
Next, we are going to play some music at
the basement!

4
00:00:11,058 --> 00:00:11,838
Andâ€¦

5
00:00:11,838 --> 00:00:12,960
T-That's the third one!

6
00:00:13,960 --> 00:00:14,960
Sleeping!

7
00:00:14,960 --> 00:00:16,960
I can't sleep without it.

8
00:00:16,960 --> 00:00:17,960
Really?

9
00:00:17,960 --> 00:00:19,960
I want to sleep when I have a break.

10
00:00:19,960 --> 00:00:21,960
You really like it.

11
00:00:21,960 --> 00:00:24,960
You need it for your body.

12
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:26,960
Yes, I need it.

13
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:32,960
When I'm tired, I need it to recharge my
energy.

14
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:35,960
For example, I need it for anime, manga,
or games.

15
00:00:35,960 --> 00:00:38,960
I need it to cheer me up.

16
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:45,960
I can sleep for 15 hours straight.

17
00:00:45,960 --> 00:00:50,960
Do you have a favorite item, like a bed,
a pillow, or pajamas?

18
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:51,960
Yes, I do.

19
00:00:51,960 --> 00:00:53,960
I'm asking you.

20
00:00:53,960 --> 00:01:00,960
I like pajamas because they are light
and stress-free.

21
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:03,960
I don't know if I'm touching it or not.

22
00:01:03,960 --> 00:01:06,960
It's like a pajama for old ladies.

23
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:10,960
Old ladies say they can't sleep well.

24
00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:12,960
And they say their bed is heavy.

25
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:17,960
I want to wear pajamas like old ladies.

26
00:01:17,960 --> 00:01:20,960
No, you're making my dream bigger.

27
00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:22,960
You're old ladies.

28
00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:24,960
I want to wear pajamas like old ladies.

29
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:26,960
I want to see it someday.

30
00:01:26,960 --> 00:01:27,960
I want to wear flashy pajamas.

31
00:01:27,960 --> 00:01:29,960
Flashy and stress-free.

32
00:01:29,960 --> 00:01:32,960
I want to buy those pajamas.

33
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:42,960
I got a cover of a bed sheet from my
sister this year.

34
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:45,960
I'm going to sleep with it.

35
00:01:45,960 --> 00:01:48,960
What else do I care about?

36
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:51,960
I have a bad sleeping habit.

37
00:01:51,960 --> 00:01:52,960
Really?

38
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:55,960
You have a bad sleeping habit.

39
00:01:55,960 --> 00:02:01,960
I'm a type of person who sleeps with a
bad sleeping habit.

40
00:02:01,960 --> 00:02:07,960
So, I sometimes can't sleep at home.

41
00:02:07,960 --> 00:02:11,960
I think you're thinking about a lot of
things.

42
00:02:11,960 --> 00:02:12,960
Is that true?

43
00:02:12,960 --> 00:02:13,960
I think so.

44
00:02:13,960 --> 00:02:15,960
I move my head without my permission.

45
00:02:15,960 --> 00:02:19,960
I can't sleep if I think about
tomorrow's schedule.

46
00:02:19,960 --> 00:02:21,960
You're a bad sleeper.

47
00:02:21,960 --> 00:02:23,960
I see.

48
00:02:23,960 --> 00:02:28,960
I have a special skill.

49
00:02:28,960 --> 00:02:29,960
I want to hear it.

50
00:02:29,960 --> 00:02:32,960
I think everyone sleeps in a bed.

51
00:02:32,960 --> 00:02:33,960
There is a bed.

52
00:02:33,960 --> 00:02:36,960
This side is a pillow.

53
00:02:36,960 --> 00:02:40,960
Then, I sleep with my head turned over.

54
00:02:40,960 --> 00:02:41,960
I see.

55
00:02:41,960 --> 00:02:43,960
I sleep with my head turned over.

56
00:02:43,960 --> 00:02:44,960
I sleep with my head turned over.

57
00:02:44,960 --> 00:02:46,960
I sleep in the opposite direction from
usual.

58
00:02:46,960 --> 00:02:49,960
I can sleep well if I change my mood.

59
00:02:49,960 --> 00:02:50,960
Please try it.

60
00:02:50,960 --> 00:02:51,960
No.

61
00:02:51,960 --> 00:02:54,960
I'm really doing the same thing.

62
00:02:54,960 --> 00:02:55,960
Really?

63
00:02:55,960 --> 00:02:56,960
I'm changing.

64
00:02:56,960 --> 00:02:57,960
You're changing.

65
00:02:57,960 --> 00:03:02,960
I'm told to sleep with my head turned
over.

66
00:03:02,960 --> 00:03:03,960
But, I don't mind.

67
00:03:03,960 --> 00:03:05,960
I feel good.

68
00:03:05,960 --> 00:03:06,960
I think so, too.

69
00:03:06,960 --> 00:03:09,960
I think you can't sleep.

70
00:03:09,960 --> 00:03:12,960
But, you can sleep well if you change
your mood.

71
00:03:12,960 --> 00:03:13,960
Do you understand?

72
00:03:13,960 --> 00:03:14,960
I do.

73
00:03:14,960 --> 00:03:17,960
That's your special skill.

74
00:03:17,960 --> 00:03:19,960
I've never heard of it.

75
00:03:19,960 --> 00:03:21,960
I'm a bad sleeper.

76
00:03:21,960 --> 00:03:23,960
I think it's the first time for you.

77
00:03:23,960 --> 00:03:26,432
Please watch again.

78
00:03:27,432 --> 00:03:29,432
I thought it was a samba.

79
00:03:32,432 --> 00:03:34,432
Is it a sound of a body?

80
00:03:34,432 --> 00:03:35,432
No.

81
00:03:35,432 --> 00:03:36,432
What kind of sound is it?

82
00:03:36,432 --> 00:03:37,432
No.

83
00:03:37,432 --> 00:03:38,432
Is it a sound of a body?

84
00:03:38,432 --> 00:03:39,432
No.

85
00:03:41,432 --> 00:03:42,432
This program is

86
00:03:43,432 --> 00:03:45,432
Lion-san, Kakkoii-san

87
00:03:46,432 --> 00:03:47,432
Takashi-san

88
00:03:49,432 --> 00:03:50,432
Meteora-san

89
00:03:50,432 --> 00:03:51,432
Kanna-san

90
00:03:51,432 --> 00:03:55,904
Lisa-san

91
00:03:55,904 --> 00:03:58,904
I sent it to you with the offer of
Masaki-san!

92
00:04:00,404 --> 00:04:07,904
Today, I'm going to put in some bathing
solution and slowly soak in the bath.

93
00:04:07,904 --> 00:04:13,381
You can try it out! Bye-bye!
