1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
I have the feeling that I can do
anything.

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:26,128
I have never done anything before, so I
think I took a step forward.

3
00:00:26,128 --> 00:00:31,128
I pretended to understand and cried.

4
00:00:31,128 --> 00:00:38,128
Today, I'm going to look back on the
BAKURO interview with the 12th year
members who finished the interview.

5
00:00:42,128 --> 00:00:45,128
First of all, Yuki.

6
00:00:45,128 --> 00:00:48,128
I went to the factory after working
part-time at a chicken restaurant.

7
00:00:48,128 --> 00:00:51,856
I opened frozen food and packed it in
various ways.

8
00:00:51,856 --> 00:00:54,856
I was doing a daytime bike for frozen
food.

9
00:00:54,856 --> 00:00:55,856
I knew it.

10
00:00:55,856 --> 00:00:56,856
I was doing it like that.

11
00:00:56,856 --> 00:00:58,856
What kind of day was it?

12
00:00:58,856 --> 00:01:06,856
We all got together at 8 o'clock in the
morning and we all went to the bus
together.

13
00:01:06,856 --> 00:01:12,856
Since then, I've only had the least
contact with the people around me.

14
00:01:12,856 --> 00:01:15,856
I often stay at the side of the music
room.

15
00:01:15,856 --> 00:01:17,856
I've been Miki since then.

16
00:01:17,856 --> 00:01:18,856
That's right.

17
00:01:18,856 --> 00:01:19,856
I see.

18
00:01:19,856 --> 00:01:22,856
Who did you interview next?

19
00:01:22,856 --> 00:01:25,856
I interviewed Yua of YUME.

20
00:01:25,856 --> 00:01:31,856
I was filmed by a camera in the MV of
PRETTY PRETTY GOOD.

21
00:01:31,856 --> 00:01:34,856
There was an incident while I was
moving.

22
00:01:34,856 --> 00:01:36,856
I lost contact with the people around
me.

23
00:01:36,856 --> 00:01:39,856
I was too high up to tell anyone.

24
00:01:39,856 --> 00:01:45,856
I lost contact with the people around me
in the music video of PPG.

25
00:01:45,856 --> 00:01:49,856
I'm sorry.

26
00:01:50,128 --> 00:01:52,128
You were talking about your part-time
job, right?

27
00:01:52,128 --> 00:01:54,128
Yes, I was.

28
00:01:54,128 --> 00:01:56,128
I was working normally.

29
00:01:56,128 --> 00:01:58,128
Were you involved with people around
you?

30
00:01:58,128 --> 00:02:00,128
Yes, I was.

31
00:02:00,128 --> 00:02:07,128
I thought you were not a person who
likes to be involved with people.

32
00:02:07,128 --> 00:02:09,128
I thought you were a friendly person.

33
00:02:09,128 --> 00:02:11,128
I don't hate it.

34
00:02:11,128 --> 00:02:15,128
I was scared of you at first.

35
00:02:15,128 --> 00:02:18,128
But now I'm scared because you're coming
to me.

36
00:02:18,128 --> 00:02:22,128
But even if I go to the gym, I don't
touch you.

37
00:02:24,128 --> 00:02:26,128
I choose you.

38
00:02:26,128 --> 00:02:28,128
I'm still in the gym.

39
00:02:28,128 --> 00:02:30,128
I'm still in the gym.

40
00:02:30,128 --> 00:02:38,128
At that time, I thought it was
impossible for me to be involved with
MAIKA.

41
00:02:38,128 --> 00:02:43,128
What kind of character was MAIKA when
she was in the game?

42
00:02:43,128 --> 00:02:45,128
What kind of character was it?

43
00:02:45,128 --> 00:02:48,128
She was a cat.

44
00:02:48,128 --> 00:02:50,128
She was wearing about 500 cats.

45
00:02:50,128 --> 00:02:54,128
In the past video, she had long bangs.

46
00:02:54,128 --> 00:02:57,128
That's exactly what I thought.

47
00:02:57,128 --> 00:03:01,128
She had long bangs and had black hair.

48
00:03:01,128 --> 00:03:08,128
I thought I might be sexy in a few
years.

49
00:03:08,128 --> 00:03:10,128
That's impossible.

50
00:03:10,128 --> 00:03:15,128
I've been in a lot of groups since then.

51
00:03:15,128 --> 00:03:18,128
We had a lot of fights.

52
00:03:18,128 --> 00:03:19,128
We fought.

53
00:03:19,128 --> 00:03:20,128
What did you fight about?

54
00:03:20,128 --> 00:03:22,128
With her.

55
00:03:22,128 --> 00:03:25,128
We fought at arm's length.

56
00:03:25,128 --> 00:03:28,128
No, I cried and came out.

57
00:03:28,128 --> 00:03:30,128
You didn't cry.

58
00:03:30,128 --> 00:03:32,128
You were crying.

59
00:03:32,128 --> 00:03:35,128
I cried in the bathroom.

60
00:03:35,128 --> 00:03:37,128
I cried.

61
00:03:37,128 --> 00:03:40,128
I was a sweet character.

62
00:03:40,128 --> 00:03:44,128
I cried in the middle of the room.

63
00:03:44,128 --> 00:03:47,128
I had a lot of such scenes.

64
00:03:47,128 --> 00:03:49,128
What is MAIKA's personality?

65
00:03:49,128 --> 00:03:50,128
I can't tell you that.

66
00:03:50,128 --> 00:03:52,128
I'm going to get a cramp.

67
00:03:52,128 --> 00:03:54,128
You don't have to tell me.

68
00:03:54,128 --> 00:03:56,128
It's okay.

69
00:03:56,128 --> 00:03:59,128
I don't need to tell you that.

70
00:03:59,128 --> 00:04:00,128
Please tell me.

71
00:04:00,128 --> 00:04:02,128
I really don't need to tell you.

72
00:04:02,128 --> 00:04:04,128
I have black hair.

73
00:04:04,128 --> 00:04:06,128
Please tell me that.

74
00:04:06,128 --> 00:04:08,128
What?

75
00:04:08,128 --> 00:04:09,128
I don't know.

76
00:04:09,128 --> 00:04:14,128
I was scared when I saw your interview.

77
00:04:14,128 --> 00:04:19,128
I'm not hiding it.

78
00:04:19,128 --> 00:04:22,128
I happened to be the most.

79
00:04:22,128 --> 00:04:25,128
I'm not that loud.

80
00:04:25,128 --> 00:04:28,128
I'm not.

81
00:04:28,128 --> 00:04:31,128
I've only been hiding and taxing.

82
00:04:31,128 --> 00:04:34,128
I've only been taxing.

83
00:04:34,128 --> 00:04:40,128
I've been taxing a lot.

84
00:04:40,128 --> 00:04:43,128
I've been using it a lot.

85
00:04:43,128 --> 00:04:45,128
I don't have any savings.

86
00:04:45,128 --> 00:04:51,128
I don't think your interview is funny.

87
00:04:51,128 --> 00:04:54,128
I'm honest.

88
00:04:54,128 --> 00:04:57,128
I've been in a taxi a lot.

89
00:04:57,128 --> 00:05:00,128
I can't help it.

90
00:05:00,128 --> 00:05:02,128
I'm not in a taxi anymore.

91
00:05:02,128 --> 00:05:08,128
I don't want to be in a taxi anymore.

92
00:05:08,128 --> 00:05:12,128
I was told by a man to show me around.

93
00:05:12,128 --> 00:05:16,128
I was told to show you around.

94
00:05:16,128 --> 00:05:18,128
I talked to him.

95
00:05:18,128 --> 00:05:21,128
I thought he was a little bit of a
pervert.

96
00:05:21,128 --> 00:05:24,128
I was told that I was a little bit of a
pervert.

97
00:05:24,128 --> 00:05:27,128
I think I've been working with you for a
week.

98
00:05:27,128 --> 00:05:32,128
I like you.

99
00:05:32,128 --> 00:05:34,128
I'm always like that.

100
00:05:34,128 --> 00:05:38,128
I like you.

101
00:05:38,128 --> 00:05:40,128
I'm sorry.

102
00:05:40,128 --> 00:05:42,128
I'm often told that.

103
00:05:42,128 --> 00:05:44,128
I'm often told that.

104
00:05:44,128 --> 00:05:49,128
You're the type of person who's allowed
to like me.

105
00:05:49,128 --> 00:05:52,128
I'm not allowed to like you.

106
00:05:52,128 --> 00:05:55,128
I'm not allowed to like you.

107
00:05:55,128 --> 00:05:59,128
We have a switch.

108
00:05:59,128 --> 00:06:04,288
I'm not allowed to like you.

109
00:06:04,288 --> 00:06:06,288
I'm not allowed to like you.

110
00:06:06,288 --> 00:06:08,288
I'm not allowed to like you.

111
00:06:08,288 --> 00:06:10,288
I'm not allowed to like you.

112
00:06:10,288 --> 00:06:12,288
What is it?

113
00:06:12,288 --> 00:06:18,704
It's hot, isn't it?

114
00:06:18,704 --> 00:06:20,704
That's...

115
00:06:20,704 --> 00:06:22,704
It's hard.

116
00:06:22,704 --> 00:06:24,704
That's a little...

117
00:06:24,704 --> 00:06:26,704
How should I put it?

118
00:06:26,704 --> 00:06:28,704
That's the reality.

119
00:06:28,704 --> 00:06:34,704
I think it's more poisonous than me.

120
00:06:34,704 --> 00:06:36,704
Certainly.

121
00:06:36,704 --> 00:06:38,704
I'll tell you what's left to see.

122
00:06:38,704 --> 00:06:43,704
My favorite scene on the first episode
of the interview is...

123
00:06:43,704 --> 00:06:46,704
That's the current music video.

124
00:06:46,704 --> 00:06:58,964
I was like, was that a

125
00:06:46,704 --> 00:06:48,964
strong one?

126
00:06:48,964 --> 00:06:55,704
When I heard that, I was like, what is
this guy?

127
00:06:55,704 --> 00:07:01,704
I don't think it's strong.

128
00:07:01,704 --> 00:07:06,704
That music video was very strong.

129
00:07:06,704 --> 00:07:10,704
Everyone was so tired that they didn't
scratch.

130
00:07:10,704 --> 00:07:18,704
I didn't think it was that strong in the
first place.

131
00:07:18,704 --> 00:07:22,704
I don't know what it is.

132
00:07:22,704 --> 00:07:30,208
I don't think it's strong.

133
00:07:30,208 --> 00:07:32,208
I don't use it with anyone.

134
00:07:32,208 --> 00:07:34,208
It's my privacy.

135
00:07:37,208 --> 00:07:42,208
I don't think I can use this part.

136
00:07:42,208 --> 00:07:45,208
Really.

137
00:07:45,208 --> 00:07:48,160
No, I can't.

138
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:53,660
I was asked by DOKU what she was talking
about.

139
00:07:53,660 --> 00:07:55,660
I was surprised.

140
00:07:57,660 --> 00:07:59,660
I was surprised, too.

141
00:07:59,660 --> 00:08:03,660
I didn't know because I was DOKUSON.

142
00:08:03,660 --> 00:08:06,660
I'm always crazy.

143
00:08:06,660 --> 00:08:08,660
I was curious about one thing.

144
00:08:08,660 --> 00:08:11,660
She was a good girl at school.

145
00:08:11,660 --> 00:08:14,660
I don't get along with anyone.

146
00:08:14,660 --> 00:08:18,660
But I have a good group photo.

147
00:08:18,660 --> 00:08:21,660
I'm sure you have a good group photo.

148
00:08:24,660 --> 00:08:28,660
I'm sure you're in the middle of a cute
girl group.

149
00:08:30,660 --> 00:08:35,660
I was always scared of DOKUSON.

150
00:08:35,660 --> 00:08:37,660
I'm sure.

151
00:08:37,660 --> 00:08:41,472
I'm scared of YUA.

152
00:08:41,472 --> 00:08:45,232
I was scared, but she was kind.

153
00:08:45,232 --> 00:08:51,472
I heard that there was no member who was
bad at getting along with her.

154
00:08:51,472 --> 00:08:58,112
I was wondering what to do because she
wasn't there.

155
00:08:58,112 --> 00:09:02,752
I was wondering how she was scared.

156
00:09:02,752 --> 00:09:06,432
She was worried about me.

157
00:09:06,432 --> 00:09:12,272
I was worried about her because she was
in a good mood.

158
00:09:12,272 --> 00:09:18,272
She is the most scary member.

159
00:09:18,272 --> 00:09:23,872
I don't have a favorite member, but I
don't want to be an enemy.

160
00:09:23,872 --> 00:09:29,402
I don't have a favorite member, but I
don't want to be an enemy.

161
00:09:29,402 --> 00:09:31,402
That's right.

162
00:09:31,402 --> 00:09:33,402
I think the finger pointing is real.

163
00:09:33,402 --> 00:09:37,402
I'm very strong-minded when I'm on the
side.

164
00:09:37,402 --> 00:09:40,402
It's okay. We're all on the side.

165
00:09:40,402 --> 00:09:42,402
That's right.

166
00:09:42,402 --> 00:09:46,402
I was told I could do whatever I wanted.

167
00:09:46,402 --> 00:09:49,402
I thought I'd try something different.

168
00:09:49,402 --> 00:09:51,402
This is the only time.

169
00:09:51,402 --> 00:09:56,402
If you're in an interview, you don't ask
an idol about their love.

170
00:09:56,402 --> 00:09:58,402
Thank you.

171
00:10:01,466 --> 00:10:04,466
I'm sorry.

172
00:10:04,466 --> 00:10:09,466
Non was a little bit of a P, but she
said you were good at interviews.

173
00:10:09,466 --> 00:10:14,466
I was told that I was really good at it.

174
00:10:15,466 --> 00:10:18,466
How was it for you?

175
00:10:18,466 --> 00:10:23,466
I think I can take this.

176
00:10:23,466 --> 00:10:31,466
Non was a little bit of a P, but she
said you were good at it.

177
00:10:31,466 --> 00:10:35,466
How was it for you?

178
00:10:35,466 --> 00:10:40,466
I was told that I was really good at it.

179
00:10:40,466 --> 00:10:46,466
I was told that I was really good at it.

180
00:10:46,466 --> 00:10:51,466
I was told that I was really good at it.

181
00:10:51,466 --> 00:10:53,466
I learned a lot.

182
00:10:53,466 --> 00:10:56,466
I learned a lot.

183
00:10:56,466 --> 00:10:58,466
I learned a lot.

184
00:10:58,466 --> 00:11:00,466
How was it?

185
00:11:00,466 --> 00:11:02,466
I want to do better.

186
00:11:02,466 --> 00:11:05,466
You're already good at it.

187
00:11:05,466 --> 00:11:08,466
You don't use it, do you?

188
00:11:08,466 --> 00:11:09,466
Bye.

189
00:11:09,466 --> 00:11:20,218
Please subscribe to my channel.

190
00:11:20,218 --> 00:11:23,218
The answer is almost P.

191
00:11:23,218 --> 00:11:26,218
I thought I had to answer this.

192
00:11:26,218 --> 00:11:28,218
I thought this was a wack.

193
00:11:30,218 --> 00:11:31,218
I thought so.

194
00:11:31,218 --> 00:11:33,218
I was asked a lot of questions.

195
00:11:33,218 --> 00:11:36,218
I was told to say everything.

196
00:11:36,218 --> 00:11:38,218
I had to say it.

197
00:11:38,218 --> 00:11:42,624
It was like a opening.

198
00:11:42,624 --> 00:11:47,624
We've been looking back at a long
history.

199
00:11:47,624 --> 00:11:52,624
We've been looking back at a lot of
things.

200
00:11:52,624 --> 00:11:59,624
We're going to have a gang parade on
January 1st.

201
00:11:59,624 --> 00:12:04,624
Did that have anything to do with this
interview?

202
00:12:04,624 --> 00:12:05,624
There is.

203
00:12:05,624 --> 00:12:08,624
Why?

204
00:12:08,624 --> 00:12:18,624
We're going to have a gang parade
memorial live on January 1st.

205
00:12:18,624 --> 00:12:23,624
We've been looking back at the history
of the gang parade.

206
00:12:23,624 --> 00:12:25,624
It was a song from the past.

207
00:12:25,624 --> 00:12:28,624
It's a recent song.

208
00:12:28,624 --> 00:12:33,624
We're going to have a live that will
lead to the future of the gang parade.

209
00:12:33,624 --> 00:12:38,624
Oh, that's what it was like.

210
00:12:38,624 --> 00:12:43,624
How can we do that?

211
00:12:43,624 --> 00:12:45,624
That's a good question.

212
00:12:45,624 --> 00:12:56,624
This is the priority of the gang parade
major force single released on November
16th.

213
00:12:56,624 --> 00:13:04,624
What is it?

214
00:13:04,624 --> 00:13:11,624
This is a priority ticket.

215
00:13:11,624 --> 00:13:15,624
Priority ticket?

216
00:13:15,624 --> 00:13:19,624
Wait, I didn't have this in the one I
bought.

217
00:13:19,624 --> 00:13:21,624
Me too.

218
00:13:21,624 --> 00:13:32,624
This is a random priority ticket for
those who got this CD.

219
00:13:32,624 --> 00:13:35,624
What can you do with that?

220
00:13:35,624 --> 00:13:36,624
What?

221
00:13:36,624 --> 00:13:37,624
I can do it.

222
00:13:37,624 --> 00:13:39,624
Is there a good thing?

223
00:13:39,624 --> 00:13:40,624
I don't know.

224
00:13:40,624 --> 00:13:41,624
What is the priority ticket?

225
00:13:41,624 --> 00:13:43,624
Is it a song?

226
00:13:43,624 --> 00:13:54,624
If you have this priority ticket, you
can participate in the lottery of the
gang parade on January 1st.

227
00:13:54,624 --> 00:14:04,624
You can enter the QR code of this
priority ticket and win the lottery.

228
00:14:04,624 --> 00:14:10,624
You can participate in the gang parade
on January 1st.

229
00:14:10,624 --> 00:14:14,624
If you win the lottery, you can get
200,000 yen.

230
00:14:14,624 --> 00:14:16,624
I can't afford it.

231
00:14:16,624 --> 00:14:25,624
If you win the lottery, you can
participate in the gang parade on
January 1st.

232
00:14:25,624 --> 00:14:28,624
What?

233
00:14:28,624 --> 00:14:36,624
You can enter the gang parade on January
1st.

234
00:14:36,624 --> 00:14:41,624
I think it's a good thing.

235
00:14:41,624 --> 00:14:47,624
It's easy.

236
00:14:47,624 --> 00:14:57,624
It's a random priority ticket, but it's
a 5-hour song.

237
00:14:57,624 --> 00:15:01,624
It's a 5-hour song.

238
00:15:01,624 --> 00:15:05,624
The history of the gang parade is not
short.

239
00:15:05,624 --> 00:15:14,624
We want to make a live with future
players while looking back on the
history of the gang parade.

240
00:15:14,624 --> 00:15:23,624
From the past songs to the latest songs,
and maybe new songs.

241
00:15:23,624 --> 00:15:29,624
But there are only three people.

242
00:15:29,624 --> 00:15:32,624
That's right.

243
00:15:32,624 --> 00:15:41,624
We will hold a gang parade memorial live
on January 1st.

244
00:15:41,624 --> 00:15:43,624
That's great.

245
00:15:43,624 --> 00:15:48,624
I was invited to the gang parade on
January 1st.

246
00:15:48,624 --> 00:15:53,264
Thank you.

247
00:15:53,264 --> 00:16:00,264
Please get this priority ticket and
apply.

248
00:16:00,264 --> 00:16:16,201
Thank you for waiting.
