1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
I don't need any of that.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:03,000
No?

3
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:05,000
I don't need it. I'm serious.

4
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:20,000
I'm fine with anyone.

5
00:00:20,608 --> 00:00:26,528
I can't see it. I can see it.

6
00:00:26,528 --> 00:00:28,988
How was it? NARUHA came in.

7
00:00:28,988 --> 00:00:30,948
From the sound of the sound of the
sound.

8
00:00:30,948 --> 00:00:34,988
But it was a year of thinking, wasn't
it?

9
00:00:34,988 --> 00:00:35,628
That's right.

10
00:00:35,628 --> 00:00:49,608
After making a major debut and doing a
whole tour, it seemed like it was going
well, but it seemed that the puzzle was
a little off.

11
00:00:49,608 --> 00:00:53,528
We don't know how to proceed with the
gang parade.

12
00:00:53,528 --> 00:00:54,408
That's right.

13
00:00:54,408 --> 00:00:57,828
I thought it was a time when it felt
like that.

14
00:00:57,828 --> 00:01:01,128
I think it's because it's continued now.

15
00:01:01,128 --> 00:01:06,788
I think it was the best work to continue
the gang parade.

16
00:01:06,788 --> 00:01:10,008
Haruna's disbandment and Saki's
disbandment?

17
00:01:10,008 --> 00:01:12,208
It was a year of separation.

18
00:01:12,208 --> 00:01:14,408
It's a pretty heavy year.

19
00:01:14,408 --> 00:01:16,608
That's why I can't use it.

20
00:01:16,608 --> 00:01:23,248
It's a bit of a hard one, so I'll just
put out the sound.

21
00:01:23,248 --> 00:01:26,488
I'm just going to use the part that I
can use.

22
00:01:26,488 --> 00:01:28,488
I wanted to do it together.

23
00:01:28,488 --> 00:01:33,888
I was pretty strong, but I couldn't do
it anymore.

24
00:01:33,888 --> 00:01:37,488
Haruna's story was fun.

25
00:01:37,488 --> 00:01:39,128
It was a shock.

26
00:01:39,128 --> 00:01:42,328
I don't think it's the most interesting
story.

27
00:01:42,328 --> 00:01:43,648
Can I talk about it?

28
00:01:43,648 --> 00:01:47,928
I don't know.

29
00:01:49,376 --> 00:01:51,376
I wanted to be free.

30
00:01:51,376 --> 00:01:55,376
And the activities of Paradise.

31
00:01:55,376 --> 00:01:57,376
I have to put it out on the screen.

32
00:01:57,376 --> 00:02:00,376
Actually, I was shooting AASA.

33
00:02:00,376 --> 00:02:04,376
I was planning to work with Haruna and
four people in Paradise.

34
00:02:04,376 --> 00:02:07,376
I put out the sound source for a moment.

35
00:02:07,376 --> 00:02:09,376
I put out the sound of G.P.Hatena.

36
00:02:09,376 --> 00:02:11,376
Haruna was in it.

37
00:02:11,376 --> 00:02:18,376
I got in touch with the practice of
Paradise the day before.

38
00:02:18,376 --> 00:02:21,376
I was very angry.

39
00:02:21,376 --> 00:02:27,376
I didn't get in touch with the practice
of G.P.Hatena the next day.

40
00:02:27,376 --> 00:02:32,376
I was worried that I would be really out
of shape if I didn't come here tomorrow.

41
00:02:32,376 --> 00:02:34,376
I didn't know what to do.

42
00:02:34,376 --> 00:02:36,376
It's best to find a place.

43
00:02:36,376 --> 00:02:42,376
It's best to bring Haruna to the stage.

44
00:02:42,376 --> 00:02:45,376
I didn't know if it was best or not.

45
00:02:45,376 --> 00:02:47,376
I struggled a lot that day.

46
00:02:47,376 --> 00:02:51,376
I didn't come to the live show the next
day.

47
00:02:51,376 --> 00:02:53,376
I struggled.

48
00:02:53,376 --> 00:02:55,376
I was wondering where Haruna was.

49
00:02:55,376 --> 00:02:58,160
I will do my best.

50
00:02:58,160 --> 00:03:00,160
Haruna is here.

51
00:03:00,160 --> 00:03:05,160
I will analyze the situation on the
Internet.

52
00:03:05,160 --> 00:03:09,160
Can I talk about this?

53
00:03:09,160 --> 00:03:11,160
I will post everything.

54
00:03:11,160 --> 00:03:17,050
NASA wars everything.

55
00:03:17,050 --> 00:03:22,050
I said I would go, but I said I would
go.

56
00:03:22,050 --> 00:03:27,050
I said I would believe in tomorrow and
wait, but I didn't come.

57
00:03:27,050 --> 00:03:30,050
I was confused as I thought.

58
00:03:30,050 --> 00:03:33,050
I wondered how I should feel about
standing on stage.

59
00:03:33,050 --> 00:03:36,050
After all, I have to laugh at the live
performance.

60
00:03:36,050 --> 00:03:39,050
But I felt like I could laugh.

61
00:03:39,050 --> 00:03:45,050
Haruka and I were very contrasting
people.

62
00:03:45,050 --> 00:03:48,050
We were rivals.

63
00:03:48,050 --> 00:03:51,050
But we were a little behind.

64
00:03:51,050 --> 00:03:54,050
I was thinking, let's do our best
because Haruna was there.

65
00:03:54,050 --> 00:03:58,160
I felt like I had a hole in my heart.

66
00:03:58,160 --> 00:04:05,160
I was the one who had a fight with the
moon.

67
00:04:05,160 --> 00:04:07,160
That's the one, right? The one in
Tawareko, Shibuya?

68
00:04:07,160 --> 00:04:09,160
Yes, the one in Tawakku.

69
00:04:09,160 --> 00:04:13,160
I was also bad at keeping things in my
mouth.

70
00:04:13,160 --> 00:04:18,160
I wasn't as soft as I am now.

71
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:20,160
Please stop it.

72
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:24,160
I was really angry once.

73
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:28,160
I was so angry when I said that.

74
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:33,160
I sang all the lyrics in four different
ways.

75
00:04:33,160 --> 00:04:35,160
I couldn't remember the lyrics.

76
00:04:35,160 --> 00:04:37,160
I made a mistake several times.

77
00:04:37,160 --> 00:04:40,160
You made a mistake many times.

78
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:42,160
When the moon appeared, I was like,

79
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:45,160
Don't sing in the wrong way.

80
00:04:45,160 --> 00:04:47,160
The moon was strange.

81
00:04:47,160 --> 00:04:49,160
I asked the moon, are you okay?

82
00:04:49,160 --> 00:04:50,160
I remember it very well.

83
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:54,160
I was like, I'm okay.

84
00:04:54,160 --> 00:05:01,160
I was like, I can't concentrate because
I made a mistake.

85
00:05:01,160 --> 00:05:05,328
I kept apologizing.

86
00:05:05,328 --> 00:05:07,328
How was it?

87
00:05:07,328 --> 00:05:15,328
It was difficult because I didn't speak
as I needed to, but I could speak to the
moon.

88
00:05:15,328 --> 00:05:17,328
He spoke unexpectedly.

89
00:05:17,328 --> 00:05:20,328
I can't use it seriously.

90
00:05:20,328 --> 00:05:24,328
I think it's about 3 minutes.

91
00:05:24,328 --> 00:05:26,328
There is a back-up plan.

92
00:05:26,328 --> 00:05:33,280
I wonder how much the interviewer side
can expose it.

93
00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:36,280
I don't think you've ever hidden your
love life.

94
00:05:36,280 --> 00:05:38,280
I think I've hidden it.

95
00:05:38,280 --> 00:05:41,280
No, I haven't.

96
00:05:42,280 --> 00:05:45,280
Who did you like at this time?

97
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:46,280
I don't have one.

98
00:05:46,280 --> 00:05:48,280
I don't have a favorite one.

99
00:05:49,280 --> 00:05:51,280
I don't know who I liked.

100
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:52,280
I don't know.

101
00:05:52,280 --> 00:05:54,280
I don't have one.

102
00:05:55,280 --> 00:05:58,280
I've only been hiding and playing tag.

103
00:05:58,280 --> 00:05:59,280
What?

104
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:03,280
I've only been playing tag.

105
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:04,280
You're small.

106
00:06:04,280 --> 00:06:06,280
I'm small.

107
00:06:06,280 --> 00:06:08,280
You've been on a lot of taxis.

108
00:06:08,280 --> 00:06:11,280
I've been using it a lot.

109
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:13,280
I don't have any savings.

110
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:17,280
I don't know.

111
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:18,280
You don't know.

112
00:06:18,280 --> 00:06:20,280
You're serious, right?

113
00:06:20,280 --> 00:06:22,280
It's too good.

114
00:06:22,280 --> 00:06:24,280
What should I do?

115
00:06:24,280 --> 00:06:26,280
You can use it.

116
00:06:26,280 --> 00:06:29,140
I don't want to be a

117
00:06:29,140 --> 00:06:31,280
next interviewer.

118
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:33,280
It's hard to wear makeup.

119
00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:35,280
It's hard for young people.

120
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:39,264
I don't think I have makeup on.

121
00:06:39,264 --> 00:06:41,264
Thank you for watching.

122
00:06:50,010 --> 00:06:56,010
I pretended not to hear you, even though
I could hear you

123
00:06:56,010 --> 00:07:00,010
I pretended to be stupid and gave up

124
00:07:00,010 --> 00:07:04,364
I can't see the full star
