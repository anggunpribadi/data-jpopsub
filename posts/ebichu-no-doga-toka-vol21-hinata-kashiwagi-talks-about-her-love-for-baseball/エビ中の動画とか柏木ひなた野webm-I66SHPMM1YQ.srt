1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Ebichu no Douga Toka

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:10,000
I'm Inata Kashiwagi, and I'm going to
talk about baseball love!

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:19,000
This time, I'm going to talk about the
charm of baseball and Tokyo Yakuza 2
arrows by myself.

4
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:27,000
The charm of baseball is that I want to
support it.

5
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:28,848
I also...

6
00:00:29,848 --> 00:00:33,848
I saw the game in 2015 CS.

7
00:00:34,848 --> 00:00:43,848
I had a wish to win and cheer for the
team.

8
00:00:44,848 --> 00:00:47,848
I watched the game of Swallows.

9
00:00:48,848 --> 00:00:53,848
So I naturally became a fan of Swallows.

10
00:00:53,848 --> 00:00:55,312
I...

11
00:00:56,312 --> 00:00:59,312
If I were to pick a player I like from
Swallows,

12
00:00:59,312 --> 00:01:04,312
I would pick the first player I fell in
love with, Shouhei Tateyama.

13
00:01:04,312 --> 00:01:06,312
I really like him.

14
00:01:06,312 --> 00:01:11,312
When I heard he was retiring, I was on
my way home.

15
00:01:11,312 --> 00:01:15,312
I went home crying without even looking
at him.

16
00:01:15,312 --> 00:01:20,312
I like his personality, but I also like
the way he plays.

17
00:01:20,312 --> 00:01:21,312
He's so cool.

18
00:01:21,312 --> 00:01:24,800
I saw him throw a CS, and I fell in love
with him.

19
00:01:24,800 --> 00:01:29,800
I thought he was cool.

20
00:01:29,800 --> 00:01:34,800
But his voice is higher than I thought.

21
00:01:34,800 --> 00:01:37,800
That's a great point.

22
00:01:37,800 --> 00:01:43,800
I recently changed my uniform number.

23
00:01:43,800 --> 00:01:49,040
I'm Murakami Munetaka, 55 years old.

24
00:01:50,040 --> 00:01:51,040
I'm the best.

25
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:54,040
Other people, including Tateyama, are
all Sanzu.

26
00:01:54,040 --> 00:01:56,040
But Murakami is the only one who is
Murakami.

27
00:01:56,040 --> 00:01:58,040
Murakami or Munetaka.

28
00:01:58,040 --> 00:02:07,040
I'm sure he's got the fighting spirit,
energy, and power to beat the enemy.

29
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:09,040
He doesn't look like he's in his 20s.

30
00:02:09,040 --> 00:02:14,040
I want him to lead the team without
getting hurt.

31
00:02:14,040 --> 00:02:16,080
I'm looking forward to seeing him.

32
00:02:17,080 --> 00:02:22,080
To be honest, I've been a fan of his for
5 or 6 years.

33
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:28,080
I don't know much about him before that.

34
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:37,080
I'll pick a player I like and a player I
think is good.

35
00:02:37,080 --> 00:02:38,080
Director?

36
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:40,080
I want to see him.

37
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:44,080
I think Nobu, the director.

38
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:44,816
I'm looking forward to seeing him.

39
00:02:45,816 --> 00:02:48,816
I can only put Tateyama-san here.

40
00:02:49,816 --> 00:02:51,816
I'm really lost.

41
00:02:52,816 --> 00:02:57,816
I want to see Tateyama-san and Shima-
san's battery.

42
00:02:58,816 --> 00:03:00,816
Gaia, Aoki-san.

43
00:03:02,816 --> 00:03:05,816
There are too many people I want to put
in.

44
00:03:07,816 --> 00:03:08,816
Wait a minute.

45
00:03:09,816 --> 00:03:10,816
I didn't think it would be this hard.

46
00:03:10,816 --> 00:03:13,816
I thought I'd already decided.

47
00:03:14,920 --> 00:03:16,920
Yamasaki Kotaro

48
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:19,920
I'm Yamasaki.

49
00:03:20,920 --> 00:03:23,920
It's okay. I'll go with Yamasaki.

50
00:03:24,920 --> 00:03:29,920
The person who puts it in here will win
the first and third.

51
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:32,920
Valenti

52
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:35,920
Sakaguchi

53
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:41,904
I'm Yamada.

54
00:03:41,904 --> 00:03:46,904
I have a lot of short hair.

55
00:03:46,904 --> 00:03:51,904
What should I choose?

56
00:03:51,904 --> 00:03:57,904
I have a lot of short hair, but I don't
think it's fixed.

57
00:03:57,904 --> 00:04:02,904
Recently, I've been thinking that
Escobar is amazing.

58
00:04:02,904 --> 00:04:04,904
I want to put it in.

59
00:04:04,904 --> 00:04:11,776
But for some reason, I have Oobiki and
Hirooka.

60
00:04:11,776 --> 00:04:13,776
And I got Hirooka.

61
00:04:13,776 --> 00:04:15,776
Escoba!

62
00:04:16,776 --> 00:04:17,776
No way!

63
00:04:17,776 --> 00:04:19,776
Ah! Wait! No!

64
00:04:19,776 --> 00:04:20,776
No way!

65
00:04:20,776 --> 00:04:22,776
Ah! Wait! No!

66
00:04:22,776 --> 00:04:24,776
No! Wait!

67
00:04:24,776 --> 00:04:26,776
No way!

68
00:04:26,776 --> 00:04:29,776
No way! There's no Escoba!

69
00:04:29,776 --> 00:04:32,776
What? Wait! Wait! Wait!

70
00:04:32,776 --> 00:04:35,776
There's no Escoba, and no Oobiki either!

71
00:04:37,400 --> 00:04:41,400
Ikeyama or Miyamoto!

72
00:04:41,400 --> 00:04:44,400
Wait, wait, wait!

73
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:45,400
No, no, no!

74
00:04:45,400 --> 00:04:46,400
You're kidding!

75
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:48,400
We have a special guest.

76
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:51,400
It's Miyamoto.

77
00:04:51,400 --> 00:04:53,400
Nice to meet you.

78
00:04:53,400 --> 00:04:54,400
Wow, the Kashiwagi family.

79
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:56,400
Nice to meet you.

80
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:57,400
The Kashiwagi family

81
00:04:57,400 --> 00:05:02,400
We're going to hear from the Kashiwagi
family, Miyamoto Shinya!

82
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:03,280
Miyamoto Shinya

83
00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:06,640
Thank you again!

84
00:05:06,640 --> 00:05:08,160
You're a big Yakult fan.

85
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:11,880
I'm not saying I'm a big fan, but I like
Yakult.

86
00:05:11,880 --> 00:05:14,840
My father has been a fan for about 40
years.

87
00:05:14,840 --> 00:05:16,640
So your father knows more about Yakult.

88
00:05:16,640 --> 00:05:18,120
Yes, he knows a lot about it.

89
00:05:18,120 --> 00:05:20,560
It's rare to see a Yakult fan.

90
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:21,640
It's rare?

91
00:05:21,640 --> 00:05:27,080
When I first came to Osaka, I thought
everyone in Tokyo was a giant fan.

92
00:05:27,080 --> 00:05:32,920
So I have the impression that Yakult
fans are basically a little different.

93
00:05:32,920 --> 00:05:34,640
Is that so?

94
00:05:34,640 --> 00:05:40,320
Now there are a lot of people, so I'm
very grateful.

95
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:44,160
But a little while ago, we didn't have
that many fans.

96
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:48,560
In the old days, we only had giant fans.

97
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:51,240
It's natural to be full of fans.

98
00:05:51,240 --> 00:05:54,240
Now, all baseball stadiums are full of
fans.

99
00:05:54,240 --> 00:06:00,520
But in 2013, when I retired, there
weren't many people.

100
00:06:00,520 --> 00:06:01,920
Oh, really?

101
00:06:01,920 --> 00:06:03,400
I couldn't join the baseball team unless
I won.

102
00:06:03,400 --> 00:06:06,280
The year I retired was the last time I
played baseball.

103
00:06:06,280 --> 00:06:12,240
So I think I made a little money by
playing five games.

104
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:14,720
And Valentine's Day is the year I hit
60.

105
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:16,840
So I joined the baseball team.

106
00:06:16,840 --> 00:06:18,680
Do you want to join the giant fans?

107
00:06:18,680 --> 00:06:21,240
What do you mean?

108
00:06:21,240 --> 00:06:23,640
Giant fans, Harada's fans.

109
00:06:23,640 --> 00:06:25,360
I don't know.

110
00:06:26,360 --> 00:06:32,360
When I first went golfing with Harada, I
was so nervous.

111
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:37,360
I was so nervous that I don't even
remember how I hit the ball.

112
00:06:38,360 --> 00:06:43,360
My father is a fan of Nagashima 3, and I
was in Osaka because of that.

113
00:06:44,360 --> 00:06:46,360
I was trying to get into the Giants.

114
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:48,360
You couldn't?

115
00:06:48,360 --> 00:06:49,360
I couldn't.

116
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:50,360
I'm not sure.

117
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:54,360
My best 9.

118
00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:57,360
I don't even have a chance to ask you
how it was.

119
00:06:58,360 --> 00:06:59,360
I was in real time.

120
00:07:00,360 --> 00:07:02,360
That's right. You're almost a member
now.

121
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:05,360
I didn't expect you to be an ace cover.

122
00:07:06,360 --> 00:07:08,360
I thought I could do it if I could be a
major ace cover.

123
00:07:12,360 --> 00:07:14,360
I haven't been fixed as a short.

124
00:07:16,360 --> 00:07:17,360
I got a big blow with FA.

125
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:20,360
Nishiura and Hirooka are not in Fuga.

126
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:23,360
I've been teaching them for two years.

127
00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:25,360
I want them to do their best.

128
00:07:26,360 --> 00:07:35,360
I want the Japanese to do their best in
the catcher, second short, and center,
which is called the center line, rather
than the foreign players.

129
00:07:36,360 --> 00:07:39,360
Nishiura and Hirooka are always
complaining.

130
00:07:40,360 --> 00:07:42,360
My father is really looking forward to
Nishiura.

131
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:44,360
Is that so?

132
00:07:44,360 --> 00:07:46,360
I've been looking forward to it.

133
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:49,360
Strong teams have good catchers and
short players.

134
00:07:50,360 --> 00:07:55,360
I was a short player, so I thought I had
to raise a short player.

135
00:07:56,360 --> 00:07:57,360
I haven't had enough for two years.

136
00:07:58,360 --> 00:07:59,360
A little longer.

137
00:08:00,360 --> 00:08:03,360
If these two are in trouble this year,
they should get a good short.

138
00:08:04,360 --> 00:08:06,360
I want them to be in danger.

139
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:11,360
I've been involved for about two years,
so I want them to do their best.

140
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:12,448
I want them to do their best.

141
00:08:13,448 --> 00:08:17,448
I want them to do their best to the
point where they can't be relied on.

142
00:08:17,448 --> 00:08:19,216
I wonder which one I should choose.

143
00:08:20,216 --> 00:08:22,216
I'm not sure.

144
00:08:22,216 --> 00:08:24,216
I'm not sure.

145
00:08:24,216 --> 00:08:27,216
I want them to do their best to the
point where they can't be relied on.

146
00:08:27,216 --> 00:08:33,216
Can I ask you about the players you've
been paying attention to recently?

147
00:08:33,216 --> 00:08:41,216
Murakami has done well in his first
year, and he's been scaling up this
year.

148
00:08:41,216 --> 00:08:46,216
Anyone can see that Murakami is amazing.

149
00:08:46,216 --> 00:08:49,216
I'm definitely Yamazaki.

150
00:08:49,216 --> 00:08:54,216
I think I've been a bit of a pushover in
my first year.

151
00:08:54,216 --> 00:08:55,216
Oh, really?

152
00:08:55,216 --> 00:08:58,216
I'm the type of guy that's like us.

153
00:08:58,216 --> 00:09:00,216
I'm not a home run player.

154
00:09:00,216 --> 00:09:05,216
I want the team to be able to execute
their strategy when they want to.

155
00:09:05,216 --> 00:09:10,216
But there were a lot of players who
didn't even know what I was doing.

156
00:09:10,216 --> 00:09:13,216
I was the first to come up and I dropped
the second team.

157
00:09:13,216 --> 00:09:21,216
I was the one who was really serious
about it.

158
00:09:21,216 --> 00:09:24,216
I think I'm probably the most serious
player in that team.

159
00:09:24,216 --> 00:09:27,216
I've been working hard this year.

160
00:09:27,216 --> 00:09:31,216
I don't think I'm the type of player
who's going to be dropped by the second
team.

161
00:09:31,216 --> 00:09:34,216
But I've been used and removed from the
team.

162
00:09:34,216 --> 00:09:40,216
I've come this far, so I'm not giving up
this year.

163
00:09:40,216 --> 00:09:45,216
I want to be able to beat him when the
team is in this situation.

164
00:09:45,216 --> 00:09:50,216
I want him to be able to endure it and
use it.

165
00:09:50,216 --> 00:09:54,216
Yamazaki and Kotaro are the ones who are
going to be eliminated.

166
00:09:54,216 --> 00:09:56,216
And then there's the pitcher.

167
00:09:56,216 --> 00:09:58,216
The pitcher won't come out.

168
00:09:58,216 --> 00:10:00,216
He won't come out.

169
00:10:00,216 --> 00:10:07,216
Players who are ranked higher in the
draft are in trouble if they get some
kind of power.

170
00:10:07,216 --> 00:10:12,216
In that case, Terashima, Hara, Hoshi,
etc.

171
00:10:12,216 --> 00:10:16,216
I think it'll change a lot when those
guys come in.

172
00:10:16,216 --> 00:10:24,216
But I think it's important not to raise
a professional player too much.

173
00:10:24,216 --> 00:10:31,216
To be specific, when you're 18, it's a
delicate time to see if your bones are
really made.

174
00:10:31,216 --> 00:10:36,064
But when you're 18, you're not sure if
you're really made.

175
00:10:36,064 --> 00:10:40,464
If you ignore this, you won't be able to
do it for a long time.

176
00:10:40,464 --> 00:10:42,464
What do you like about Tateyama?

177
00:10:42,464 --> 00:10:43,824
What do I like?

178
00:10:43,824 --> 00:10:49,584
The first time I watched Yakult's game
was on TV.

179
00:10:49,584 --> 00:10:53,424
That was the 2015 CS.

180
00:10:53,424 --> 00:10:56,464
Tateyama was throwing it.

181
00:10:56,464 --> 00:11:01,824
I saw something coming in that form.

182
00:11:01,824 --> 00:11:05,408
I felt like I wanted to support
Tateyama.

183
00:11:06,408 --> 00:11:12,408
I think he knows this, but he has a lot
of surgeries.

184
00:11:12,408 --> 00:11:15,408
We joke around and say,

185
00:11:15,408 --> 00:11:18,408
his goal is to become a demon.

186
00:11:18,408 --> 00:11:25,008
I think it's about how many scars he
left on his body.

187
00:11:26,008 --> 00:11:29,008
He's a surgery maniac. He had surgery
after he retired.

188
00:11:29,008 --> 00:11:34,008
Did you know? He had surgery after he
retired last year because he wanted to
study training.

189
00:11:34,008 --> 00:11:36,008
There's no one like that.

190
00:11:36,008 --> 00:11:38,008
I've never heard of it.

191
00:11:38,008 --> 00:11:40,008
He's completely M.

192
00:11:40,008 --> 00:11:43,008
He's like, do you want to get that much
scar?

193
00:11:43,008 --> 00:11:47,008
But every time he changes,

194
00:11:47,008 --> 00:11:50,256
He's a through-and-through surgeon.

195
00:11:50,256 --> 00:11:55,776
I was working as an ace, and I was
winning a lot.

196
00:11:55,776 --> 00:11:59,896
So I was on the team that could not lose
a game against Tateyama.

197
00:11:59,896 --> 00:12:02,496
I went twice.

198
00:12:02,496 --> 00:12:03,856
You don't know, do you?

199
00:12:03,856 --> 00:12:05,056
I don't know.

200
00:12:05,056 --> 00:12:06,336
How old were you born?

201
00:12:06,336 --> 00:12:08,136
I was born in 1999.

202
00:12:08,136 --> 00:12:13,056
You were 5 years old at the time of the
Olympics.

203
00:12:13,056 --> 00:12:19,416
Now, Samurai Japan is a professional
international tournament.

204
00:12:19,416 --> 00:12:23,056
The 2004 Athens Olympics was the first
time I went all-pro.

205
00:12:23,056 --> 00:12:26,456
Until then, the Olympic history was that
amateurs were competing.

206
00:12:26,456 --> 00:12:27,576
Oh, really?

207
00:12:27,576 --> 00:12:28,576
Yes.

208
00:12:28,576 --> 00:12:32,216
Before the Athens Olympics, the Sydney
Olympics,

209
00:12:32,216 --> 00:12:35,696
professional baseball was banned, and I
went to the Congo team.

210
00:12:35,696 --> 00:12:37,536
I couldn't win a medal.

211
00:12:37,536 --> 00:12:40,816
So I decided to go all-pro at the Athens
Olympics.

212
00:12:40,816 --> 00:12:44,496
I think you know, Kashiwagi, and
Nagashima were the coaches.

213
00:12:44,496 --> 00:12:46,776
I went to the Olympics.

214
00:12:46,776 --> 00:12:49,896
Unfortunately, I lost the semi-final,

215
00:12:49,896 --> 00:12:52,616
but I won the third place and got the
bronze medal.

216
00:12:52,616 --> 00:12:55,736
When I lost, I couldn't go home,

217
00:12:55,736 --> 00:12:58,776
so I said, let's go to the Italian Pro
League together.

218
00:12:58,776 --> 00:13:00,376
What?

219
00:13:00,376 --> 00:13:01,896
I said, I'm going all-pro,

220
00:13:01,896 --> 00:13:05,576
and I thought I'd win all the gold
medals and come home.

221
00:13:05,576 --> 00:13:09,536
But I lost the Australian semi-final
1-0.

222
00:13:09,536 --> 00:13:11,896
But I thought, I can't go home to Japan.

223
00:13:11,896 --> 00:13:15,696
I was seriously talking about going to
the Italian Pro League.

224
00:13:15,696 --> 00:13:16,896
I was a rookie,

225
00:13:16,896 --> 00:13:22,056
but I was allowed to play as a
professional.

226
00:13:22,056 --> 00:13:24,456
I went home crying.

227
00:13:24,456 --> 00:13:27,216
In Beijing, I was beaten up so badly.

228
00:13:27,216 --> 00:13:28,376
I couldn't win a medal.

229
00:13:28,376 --> 00:13:31,016
I lost to Hoshino, the coach.

230
00:13:31,016 --> 00:13:32,496
I lost all the games.

231
00:13:32,496 --> 00:13:35,256
I was beaten up on the internet.

232
00:13:35,256 --> 00:13:39,976
I didn't know how to read the internet
back then.

233
00:13:39,976 --> 00:13:44,576
I might be in trouble now.

234
00:13:44,576 --> 00:13:47,176
What do you like about baseball?

235
00:13:47,176 --> 00:13:48,816
I don't know.

236
00:13:48,816 --> 00:13:52,496
I think it's related to my group,

237
00:13:52,496 --> 00:13:58,616
or to my live performances.

238
00:13:58,616 --> 00:14:02,136
I go to see the baseball games,

239
00:14:02,136 --> 00:14:04,640
I say hi out loud or whatever.

240
00:14:04,640 --> 00:14:09,340
I feel a lot of gratitude from the fans.

241
00:14:09,340 --> 00:14:11,340
I see.

242
00:14:11,340 --> 00:14:14,640
But baseball is like watching baseball
players.

243
00:14:14,640 --> 00:14:20,640
I think it's interesting that you don't
know what's going to happen until the
end.

244
00:14:20,640 --> 00:14:21,640
I see.

245
00:14:21,640 --> 00:14:25,640
There are quite a few baseball games
that win in the end.

246
00:14:25,640 --> 00:14:30,640
It's often said that baseball is a drama
without a plot.

247
00:14:30,640 --> 00:14:33,232
Even from the 9th inning.

248
00:14:34,232 --> 00:14:37,232
Sometimes you can make a comeback.

249
00:14:37,232 --> 00:14:39,232
I did it a few years ago.

250
00:14:39,232 --> 00:14:43,232
I turned it over about 10 points before
I became a coach.

251
00:14:43,232 --> 00:14:49,232
It was a game that turned it over about
6 points when I was there.

252
00:14:49,232 --> 00:14:52,232
It's interesting to do that.

253
00:14:52,232 --> 00:14:57,232
When you make a big comeback, you don't
have that atmosphere at first.

254
00:14:57,232 --> 00:15:00,496
Somehow, I got a point.

255
00:15:00,496 --> 00:15:03,376
I think people who come around here are
pretty nervous.

256
00:15:03,376 --> 00:15:07,296
I've come this far, and if I'm out, it's
not good.

257
00:15:07,296 --> 00:15:09,776
There's a place like that, so there's
pressure.

258
00:15:09,776 --> 00:15:12,176
I'm going to play in the first half.

259
00:15:12,176 --> 00:15:14,936
It's fun when it's like, I don't care
anymore.

260
00:15:14,936 --> 00:15:16,776
I've been to Noidona three times.

261
00:15:16,776 --> 00:15:20,056
I had a pitcher named Bross in my first
year.

262
00:15:20,056 --> 00:15:23,896
He's been playing perfect about seven
times.

263
00:15:23,896 --> 00:15:25,416
So I didn't get a runner.

264
00:15:25,416 --> 00:15:27,616
And then I was a defensive player.

265
00:15:27,616 --> 00:15:28,720
I wasn't a regular at the time.

266
00:15:29,720 --> 00:15:31,720
I was in the second division of the
Mamoru Ikei.

267
00:15:31,720 --> 00:15:34,720
So, in a perfect match, you can't make
any mistakes.

268
00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:36,720
So I was really nervous.

269
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:38,512
So, in the 7th or 8th round, I was
really nervous.

270
00:15:38,512 --> 00:15:40,832
I can't forget, he was using a slider
and said,

271
00:15:40,832 --> 00:15:41,952
Mr. Goto,

272
00:15:41,952 --> 00:15:43,752
who is now a Giants coach,

273
00:15:43,752 --> 00:15:45,952
Mr. Goto was a dead baller.

274
00:15:45,952 --> 00:15:46,672
At that moment, I thought,

275
00:15:46,672 --> 00:15:48,912
Wow, that's great.

276
00:15:48,912 --> 00:15:49,472
You were nervous?

277
00:15:49,472 --> 00:15:50,872
This is how you can make mistakes.

278
00:15:50,872 --> 00:15:52,712
Oh, I see.

279
00:15:52,712 --> 00:15:55,392
So, when you think you can't make a
mistake,

280
00:15:55,392 --> 00:15:59,552
you should make a mistake.

281
00:15:59,552 --> 00:16:00,992
I thought about it that way.

282
00:16:00,992 --> 00:16:03,672
He was doing the Kegyo No Hito.

283
00:16:03,672 --> 00:16:06,712
Next, Kazuhisa Ishii was doing Yokohama
Stadium.

284
00:16:06,712 --> 00:16:09,632
He was doing it 7 or 8 times.

285
00:16:09,632 --> 00:16:11,792
There was a surgery,

286
00:16:11,792 --> 00:16:13,712
so he asked the director,

287
00:16:13,712 --> 00:16:15,352
what he should do.

288
00:16:15,352 --> 00:16:17,232
He said, I'm good.

289
00:16:17,232 --> 00:16:18,712
I said, don't say that, just go.

290
00:16:18,712 --> 00:16:19,712
And he did the Kegyo No Hito.

291
00:16:19,712 --> 00:16:22,832
The third time was Gatoumuson.

292
00:16:22,832 --> 00:16:24,632
It was a Rakuten match.

293
00:16:24,632 --> 00:16:26,792
When I noticed it,

294
00:16:26,792 --> 00:16:28,992
I felt like I had gone that far.

295
00:16:28,992 --> 00:16:30,712
When you're defending,

296
00:16:30,712 --> 00:16:32,712
in the Kegyo No Hito,

297
00:16:32,712 --> 00:16:35,272
even if you can make a hit,

298
00:16:35,272 --> 00:16:37,872
you have to make mistakes.

299
00:16:37,872 --> 00:16:41,552
It depends on the score.

300
00:16:41,552 --> 00:16:43,192
If you're 1 point behind,

301
00:16:43,192 --> 00:16:44,952
you don't have that much room.

302
00:16:44,952 --> 00:16:46,952
But if you get 5 or 6 points,

303
00:16:46,952 --> 00:16:49,872
you can do that for a small pitch.

304
00:16:49,872 --> 00:16:51,312
I thought that was the way to go.

305
00:16:51,312 --> 00:16:54,224
I was defending like that.

306
00:16:55,224 --> 00:16:57,224
I got hit by a no hit no run in CS.

307
00:16:58,224 --> 00:17:00,224
That was the first time in my baseball
life.

308
00:17:01,224 --> 00:17:03,224
I was playing baseball all the time in
elementary school, and I got hit by a no
hit no run.

309
00:17:04,224 --> 00:17:06,224
It was my first time to lose a game in
Takeda.

310
00:17:07,224 --> 00:17:09,224
I got a lot of points in those two
years.

311
00:17:13,224 --> 00:17:17,224
I think that no hit no run of Sugano-san
is still in the fans' memory.

312
00:17:18,224 --> 00:17:20,224
There were a lot of foreshadowing the
day before.

313
00:17:20,224 --> 00:17:23,224
I was playing a game that I was supposed
to win.

314
00:17:24,224 --> 00:17:26,224
I was making a lot of countermeasures.

315
00:17:27,224 --> 00:17:29,224
But one of the players didn't play the
game.

316
00:17:30,224 --> 00:17:34,224
That's why I had to teach him how to
play.

317
00:17:35,224 --> 00:17:38,224
But when the game was over, he was a
player who was cute.

318
00:17:39,224 --> 00:17:41,224
If you lose tomorrow, you're the ones
who will win.

319
00:17:42,224 --> 00:17:44,224
You have to do your best on the scene
tomorrow.

320
00:17:45,224 --> 00:17:47,224
If you say that, it's a no hit no run.

321
00:17:47,224 --> 00:17:49,224
It's like, it's over.

322
00:17:50,224 --> 00:17:52,224
It was like that.

323
00:17:53,224 --> 00:17:55,224
I have one question.

324
00:17:56,224 --> 00:17:58,224
You lost 16 consecutive games last year.

325
00:17:59,224 --> 00:18:01,224
How do you feel about losing?

326
00:18:02,224 --> 00:18:08,224
At first, I thought I'd win if I kept
losing.

327
00:18:09,224 --> 00:18:11,224
I thought I'd win anyway.

328
00:18:12,224 --> 00:18:15,224
But I started to feel like I was going
to lose.

329
00:18:15,224 --> 00:18:16,224
That's right.

330
00:18:17,224 --> 00:18:20,224
It was my first time losing in a game
with more than two players.

331
00:18:21,224 --> 00:18:24,224
16 consecutive losses means I haven't
won in almost three weeks.

332
00:18:25,224 --> 00:18:27,224
I've been playing the game for three
weeks.

333
00:18:28,224 --> 00:18:29,224
I know.

334
00:18:30,224 --> 00:18:32,224
It's like a hotel room.

335
00:18:33,224 --> 00:18:34,224
It's funny.

336
00:18:35,224 --> 00:18:38,224
It's like a hotel room.

337
00:18:38,224 --> 00:18:44,224
I thought it was the same when I was a
player.

338
00:18:45,224 --> 00:18:47,224
I can see that the player's body isn't
moving.

339
00:18:48,224 --> 00:18:50,224
It's completely different from usual.

340
00:18:51,224 --> 00:18:54,224
I wonder what the countermeasures are
like at that time.

341
00:18:55,224 --> 00:18:57,224
When I'm playing, I think about what I'm
doing.

342
00:18:58,224 --> 00:18:59,224
It's hard.

343
00:19:00,224 --> 00:19:04,224
When you're over 10, you wake up at the
alarm clock in the morning.

344
00:19:04,224 --> 00:19:08,224
Your eyes are open, but your body isn't.

345
00:19:09,224 --> 00:19:13,224
You're like, wow, I'm here again today.

346
00:19:14,224 --> 00:19:16,224
You wake up with a frown on your face.

347
00:19:17,224 --> 00:19:18,224
You watch sports news.

348
00:19:19,224 --> 00:19:21,224
You're writing a pre-selection picture.

349
00:19:21,224 --> 00:19:25,200
I know the day before, but I'm writing a
pre-selection picture.

350
00:19:27,160 --> 00:19:30,160
I was thinking, how can I beat him?

351
00:19:30,160 --> 00:19:33,160
Everyone, including the batting coach,
is thinking about it.

352
00:19:33,160 --> 00:19:37,160
They're all doing this and that, and
they're all thinking about what to do
with the members.

353
00:19:37,160 --> 00:19:40,160
But it didn't go well.

354
00:19:40,160 --> 00:19:43,160
The last game I won was a big blow.

355
00:19:43,160 --> 00:19:45,160
At Yokohama Stadium in the space ship.

356
00:19:45,160 --> 00:19:47,160
I won, but I didn't win.

357
00:19:47,160 --> 00:19:49,160
I was in a bad mood.

358
00:19:49,160 --> 00:19:51,160
I was in a bad mood.

359
00:19:51,160 --> 00:19:53,160
I was in a bad mood.

360
00:19:53,160 --> 00:19:56,160
Yokohama Stadium in the space ship.

361
00:19:56,160 --> 00:19:57,160
I won.

362
00:19:57,160 --> 00:20:01,160
I was making a big deal of the players
when I won.

363
00:20:01,160 --> 00:20:06,160
I thought I'd lose again.

364
00:20:06,160 --> 00:20:08,160
I've lost 16 straight times.

365
00:20:08,160 --> 00:20:10,160
I understand how you feel.

366
00:20:10,160 --> 00:20:13,160
I thought it would be okay because I was
laughing so much.

367
00:20:13,160 --> 00:20:18,160
I buzzed first and won 5 points apart
and lost by a reverse.

368
00:20:18,160 --> 00:20:19,160
What's going on there?

369
00:20:21,656 --> 00:20:23,656
It's hard for the fans too, losing so
many points.

370
00:20:23,656 --> 00:20:27,656
On the contrary, I worry about the
players.

371
00:20:27,656 --> 00:20:28,656
I know.

372
00:20:28,656 --> 00:20:32,656
I wonder if they have something wrong
with them.

373
00:20:32,656 --> 00:20:41,656
There are about 9 points, but the
players do feel the pressure, but in the
end, they can't move their bodies.

374
00:20:41,656 --> 00:20:45,656
But the coach can't do the difficult
things himself.

375
00:20:45,656 --> 00:20:47,656
So all you can do is ask.

376
00:20:47,656 --> 00:20:52,656
You ask for a strategy, and the coach is
the one who decides the final strategy.

377
00:20:52,656 --> 00:20:54,656
We don't do the strategy ourselves.

378
00:20:54,656 --> 00:20:58,656
We come up with a strategy, but we only
ask for it.

379
00:20:58,656 --> 00:21:02,656
I'm asking so much that I think, was I
supposed to be this clumsy?

380
00:21:02,656 --> 00:21:07,488
It's like, please, coach, please,
please, please, please.

381
00:21:08,488 --> 00:21:14,488
The most important thing to win is...

382
00:21:14,488 --> 00:21:18,488
I'm sure there are other things besides
pitchers.

383
00:21:18,488 --> 00:21:21,488
First of all, not just pitchers.

384
00:21:21,488 --> 00:21:25,488
I've been in charge of it for two years,
so I have a lot of responsibility.

385
00:21:25,488 --> 00:21:33,488
I think it's more important to look five
years ahead and form a team than the
next year, the next year, or this year.

386
00:21:33,488 --> 00:21:37,488
First of all, I think it's tough.

387
00:21:37,488 --> 00:21:44,488
I know that the fans want to see that
kind of thing as soon as possible.

388
00:21:44,488 --> 00:21:51,488
If you play 143 games in a year, you'll
have a lot of teamwork.

389
00:21:51,488 --> 00:21:55,488
You can't win just by momentum. Momentum
is important.

390
00:21:55,488 --> 00:21:59,488
So first of all, you have to make an
effort to build yourself.

391
00:21:59,488 --> 00:22:04,488
But when it comes to pitchers, you
should throw a little more.

392
00:22:04,488 --> 00:22:09,488
After all, there are many players who
don't throw because they say that the
shoulder is a consumable.

393
00:22:09,488 --> 00:22:13,488
And pitchers have to throw it.

394
00:22:13,488 --> 00:22:18,488
I'm wondering if there's a way to
improve without throwing.

395
00:22:18,488 --> 00:22:21,488
This may be a Yashio's idea.

396
00:22:21,488 --> 00:22:23,488
Yashio is a line touch.

397
00:22:23,488 --> 00:22:26,488
If you throw a line, you can't throw it.

398
00:22:26,488 --> 00:22:32,488
When you're camping or throwing, you
have to throw a lot and soak it into
your body.

399
00:22:32,488 --> 00:22:36,488
I think it's not going to get better.

400
00:22:36,488 --> 00:22:40,488
I want you to go back to the origin.

401
00:22:40,488 --> 00:22:45,488
There are a lot of ways to train now.

402
00:22:45,488 --> 00:22:48,488
I think there's a good one and a bad
one.

403
00:22:48,488 --> 00:22:51,488
But in the end, you have to throw it to
learn.

404
00:22:51,488 --> 00:22:59,488
Even if you have a great body, you can't
throw it where you want to.

405
00:22:59,488 --> 00:23:03,488
Baseball players often say that they are
athletes.

406
00:23:03,488 --> 00:23:05,488
I don't think I'm an athlete.

407
00:23:05,488 --> 00:23:07,488
I think I'm a technician.

408
00:23:07,488 --> 00:23:15,488
Baseball is a game of throwing, running,
and running.

409
00:23:15,488 --> 00:23:19,488
And you have to be smart about running.

410
00:23:19,488 --> 00:23:22,488
There's too much to do.

411
00:23:22,488 --> 00:23:25,488
It's a matter of physical strength, of
course.

412
00:23:25,488 --> 00:23:28,488
But you need a lot of technology.

413
00:23:28,488 --> 00:23:33,488
If you have the strength to rely on a
lot of practice, you can practice a lot
of technology.

414
00:23:33,488 --> 00:23:36,488
If you don't have this physical
strength, if the engine is small,

415
00:23:36,488 --> 00:23:39,488
For example, if you throw a 100 ball, it
will collapse.

416
00:23:39,488 --> 00:23:43,488
But if you have an engine like this, you
can throw about 200 balls.

417
00:23:43,488 --> 00:23:46,488
Then you'll definitely learn the
technology.

418
00:23:46,488 --> 00:23:47,488
It's simple.

419
00:23:47,488 --> 00:23:54,488
It's hard, but it's a job, so you have
to work hard.

420
00:23:54,488 --> 00:23:58,488
It's not easy to get better just by
throwing a little.

421
00:23:58,488 --> 00:24:03,488
I'm going to improve my team's strength,
but I have to improve my strength.

422
00:24:03,488 --> 00:24:06,488
If you don't get stronger, you won't be
a strong team.

423
00:24:06,488 --> 00:24:10,488
I just want the players to work hard to
catch up.

424
00:24:10,488 --> 00:24:13,488
I think that's how it's going to change.

425
00:24:13,488 --> 00:24:23,488
I think it's a good team if they can do
it independently for the next two years.

426
00:24:23,488 --> 00:24:25,488
I was serious.

427
00:24:25,488 --> 00:24:28,488
Thank you.

428
00:24:28,488 --> 00:24:34,488
Today, I had Miyama-san come as a
surprise guest.

429
00:24:34,488 --> 00:24:39,488
I think the people watching on the
screen are thinking,

430
00:24:39,488 --> 00:24:44,488
I'm so happy to see you like this.

431
00:24:44,488 --> 00:24:47,488
I heard a lot of stories today.

432
00:24:47,488 --> 00:24:53,488
The last story is that I'm standing on
the stage as an idol.

433
00:24:53,488 --> 00:24:59,552
I think you're talking about baseball,
but I'm thinking about me.

434
00:25:00,552 --> 00:25:03,552
I feel like I'm getting advice from you.

435
00:25:03,552 --> 00:25:06,552
I learned a lot from you.

436
00:25:06,552 --> 00:25:10,552
I was really happy to have this
opportunity.

437
00:25:10,552 --> 00:25:13,552
Thank you very much.

438
00:25:13,552 --> 00:25:18,552
I thought you were talking about
baseball, or Swallows.

439
00:25:18,552 --> 00:25:22,552
I thought you were talking about
Swallows.

440
00:25:22,552 --> 00:25:25,552
I thought you were talking about
Swallows.

441
00:25:25,552 --> 00:25:28,552
I was like, ah, ah, ah.

442
00:25:28,552 --> 00:25:29,504
It's precious.

443
00:25:29,504 --> 00:25:34,844
I've experienced it, and I've met
Miyamoto.

444
00:25:34,844 --> 00:25:44,984
I don't think I've had a chance to hear
such a deep story.

445
00:25:44,984 --> 00:25:49,264
I'm glad I was able to hear it.

446
00:25:49,264 --> 00:25:52,124
I was really happy this time.

447
00:25:52,124 --> 00:25:59,552
I'm sure the TORONTO fans and baseball
fans didn't expect this.

448
00:26:00,552 --> 00:26:02,552
I'm sure they'll watch this video.

449
00:26:02,552 --> 00:26:10,552
I'm sure the fans of Soarers and
Miyamoto will watch this video.

450
00:26:10,552 --> 00:26:15,552
I hope this video will spread to
everyone.

451
00:26:15,552 --> 00:26:20,552
I hope there are people like me who will
become Soarers fans.

452
00:26:20,552 --> 00:26:22,208
I hope there are people like me who will
become Soarers fans.

453
00:26:23,208 --> 00:26:26,208
Like Miyamoto-san said, before joining
Yakult, she was a fan of the Titans.

454
00:26:27,208 --> 00:26:29,208
There are not many Soarers fans around.

455
00:26:30,208 --> 00:26:36,208
So, like I told Riko-chan about the
charm of Soarers and baseball,

456
00:26:37,208 --> 00:26:46,208
I will talk about Soarers and increase
the number of Soarers fans.

457
00:26:46,208 --> 00:26:52,032
I hope there are people like me who will
become Soarers fans.

458
00:26:53,032 --> 00:27:02,032
I met a lot of people who are involved
in Yakult and learned a lot.

459
00:27:03,032 --> 00:27:08,032
I'm not paying back in a sudden, but I'm
trying to do something in a sudden.

460
00:27:09,032 --> 00:27:15,032
I'm trying to do something to repay my
little power.

461
00:27:15,032 --> 00:27:20,496
I will continue to support Tokyo Yakult
Soarers with all my might.

462
00:27:21,496 --> 00:27:23,496
I will continue to do my best!

463
00:27:25,496 --> 00:27:27,496
I met Miyawaki-san!

464
00:27:27,496 --> 00:27:47,496
Thank you very much!
