00:00:08,570 --> 00:00:15,570
In the middle of the summer, the banana
man is entering the Hokkaido park

4
00:00:16,570 --> 00:00:22,570
As the official cameraman, he is
shooting the members' faces

5
00:00:23,570 --> 00:00:27,570
Himura was very excited when he arrived
in trouble

6
00:00:28,570 --> 00:00:32,570
Oh no, the switch is off

7
00:00:32,570 --> 00:00:38,570
He is so painful

8
00:00:43,898 --> 00:00:45,898
Tonight's final episode

9
00:00:45,898 --> 00:00:48,898
Did they get the best shot?

10
00:00:49,898 --> 00:00:56,898
Especially, I want to see the camera
line between the front and the exit

11
00:00:58,898 --> 00:01:00,898
This is good

12
00:01:02,898 --> 00:01:04,898
Who is this?

13
00:01:04,898 --> 00:01:09,914
Who is this?

14
00:01:09,914 --> 00:01:11,914
I'll take this.

15
00:01:11,914 --> 00:01:13,914
No, you can't.

16
00:01:13,914 --> 00:01:15,914
I don't think I can.

17
00:01:15,914 --> 00:01:26,330
But I don't know.

18
00:01:26,330 --> 00:01:28,330

Unlike other white Elementary School
students.

00:01:51,986 --> 00:01:54,406
The Korean ship

00:02:18,674 --> 00:02:21,674
Today, Banana Man is watching us.

40
00:02:23,674 --> 00:02:27,674
He said, all our fans are united.

41
00:02:28,674 --> 00:02:29,674
He is coming out.

42
00:02:29,674 --> 00:02:32,674
He is coming out.

43
00:02:33,312 --> 00:02:35,312
Yes, yes, yes.

44
00:02:35,312 --> 00:02:37,312
Normally, something is strange.

45
00:02:37,312 --> 00:02:43,514
It hurts.

46
00:02:43,514 --> 00:02:46,514
I don't know. I just saw the picture.

47
00:02:46,514 --> 00:02:48,514
I wanted to take a picture of the moment
the bug stopped.

48
00:02:48,514 --> 00:02:51,514
I was surprised by that.

49
00:02:51,514 --> 00:03:12,514
And the live performance was a hit at
the Himegaw Grand Prix.

50
00:03:27,194 --> 00:03:32,194
After this, they move to a new place to
find a new structure.

51
00:03:40,194 --> 00:03:41,194
I see.

52
00:03:41,194 --> 00:03:43,194
This is totally different.

The live show is the climax.

88
00:06:59,674 --> 00:07:05,350
The new song, Banana Man, and Volpheus
have reached their limit.

89
00:07:05,350 --> 00:07:10,350
Volpheus is a Japanese-American singer.

90
00:07:10,350 --> 00:07:12,350
This is a great song.

91
00:07:12,350 --> 00:07:14,350
The song is very good.

92
00:07:14,350 --> 00:07:16,350

00:07:27,350 --> 00:07:29,350
This is very good.

00:07:29,350 --> 00:07:33,350
This is very good.

00:07:33,350 --> 00:07:35,350

00:07:57,350 --> 00:07:59,350

00:08:02,522 --> 00:08:04,522
This is amazing!

108
00:08:05,254 --> 00:08:09,254
Let's try to get out of the dark

109
00:08:09,254 --> 00:08:15,254
I'm taking you far away from the sun

110
00:08:15,254 --> 00:08:19,254
The sky is free

111
00:08:19,254 --> 00:08:21,254
I can go

112
00:08:21,254 --> 00:08:24,254
The waves are running

113
00:08:24,254 --> 00:08:29,254
I'm going to the hot season

114
00:08:29,254 --> 00:08:33,254
I'm going to the hot season

115
00:08:33,254 --> 00:08:35,254
This is great!

116
00:08:35,546 --> 00:08:41,546
The banana man has gathered for the
first time in a long time for the truck
shooting

117
00:08:45,546 --> 00:08:47,546
It's so close

118
00:08:54,546 --> 00:08:56,546
I can't see anything

119
00:08:56,546 --> 00:08:58,546
I can't see anything

120
00:08:58,546 --> 00:09:08,186
Please take a picture of me

121
00:09:08,186 --> 00:09:11,186
The first time I saw this, everyone
said,

122
00:09:11,186 --> 00:09:13,186
I said, and they let me out.

123
00:09:13,186 --> 00:09:15,186
The second half of the second half is
completely

124
00:09:15,186 --> 00:09:17,186
I called you a lot.

125
00:09:17,186 --> 00:09:19,186
I couldn't find it at all.

126
00:09:19,186 --> 00:09:21,186
Seriously, this is super.

127
00:09:21,186 --> 00:09:23,186
Eiga! Eiga!

128
00:09:23,186 --> 00:09:25,186
I'll go this far.

129
00:09:25,186 --> 00:09:27,186
But after all, I'm singing.

130
00:09:27,186 --> 00:09:30,186
I'm screaming a lot.

131
00:09:31,186 --> 00:09:33,186
I didn't know that.

132
00:09:33,186 --> 00:09:35,186
I didn't know how to do it.

133
00:09:35,186 --> 00:09:37,186
I'm getting a head start.

134
00:09:37,186 --> 00:09:39,186
I'm going to go to the microwave.

135
00:09:43,706 --> 00:09:49,906
Next up, in the center, is Asuka Saito's
song…

136
00:09:49,906 --> 00:09:53,926
She's the princess of the land.

137
00:09:54,326 --> 00:09:55,526
Justiver!

138
00:09:55,526 --> 00:09:57,526
It was a good fight.

139
00:09:57,526 --> 00:10:03,386
It was a good fight.

140
00:10:03,386 --> 00:10:05,386
She is shooting.

141
00:10:06,386 --> 00:10:07,386
She is shooting.

142
00:10:08,386 --> 00:10:09,386
She is shooting very well.

143
00:10:10,386 --> 00:10:13,386
I didn't know she was shooting.

144
00:10:13,386 --> 00:10:15,386
I didn't know she was shooting.

145
00:10:15,386 --> 00:10:19,386
If you had told me, I would have taken
it in a hurry.

146
00:10:19,386 --> 00:10:21,386
You and Asuka were shooting together.

147
00:10:21,386 --> 00:10:24,386
I thought you two couldn't shoot it.

148
00:10:24,386 --> 00:10:25,386
But you were able to shoot it.

149
00:10:25,386 --> 00:10:26,386
Look at this.

150
00:10:26,386 --> 00:10:31,104
You were discussing it in advance.

151
00:10:31,104 --> 00:10:33,104
I sometimes discuss it, and sometimes I
don't.

152
00:10:33,104 --> 00:10:35,104
But this time I was discussing it.

153
00:10:35,104 --> 00:10:37,104
So everyone was coming.

154
00:10:37,104 --> 00:10:41,104
I knew that if I did a ball shark, I
would get a perfect score.

155
00:10:41,104 --> 00:10:43,104
That's the way to say it.

156
00:10:45,104 --> 00:10:47,104
I was surprised. I'm glad I got this.

157
00:10:47,104 --> 00:11:05,104
I'm glad I got this.

158
00:11:05,786 --> 00:11:08,786
And the live show finally comes to an
end.

159
00:11:19,786 --> 00:11:22,786
Thank you very much for today.

160
00:11:22,786 --> 00:11:27,290
Thank you very much.

161
00:11:27,290 --> 00:11:31,050
The two men continue shooting without
rest even after entering the encore

162
00:11:31,050 --> 00:11:55,650
oner

163
00:11:57,146 --> 00:12:01,146
Himura also goes to the stairs on the
opposite side.

164
00:12:01,146 --> 00:12:05,526

165
00:12:25,006 --> 00:12:25,766

166
00:12:25,766 --> 00:12:27,326
No one has noticed me here

167
00:12:27,326 --> 00:12:29,706
Hey, it's surprising. straight

00:13:02,618 --> 00:13:06,218
Before IUUM gets here, I'd like to
stopper lovely SupaLY for the amazing
night view of Poland

179
00:13:18,554 --> 00:13:20,554
I can't hear you.

Oh, good.

It's going up.

00:13:39,298 --> 00:13:41,498
I'm atop this silence now...

187
00:13:42,258 --> 00:13:43,130
Water總 mao?

188
00:13:43,130 --> 00:13:45,130
I'm sorry.

189
00:13:45,130 --> 00:13:47,130
Oh my god.

190
00:13:47,130 --> 00:13:49,130
I went to the stage.

191
00:13:50,130 --> 00:13:52,130
I stood on the stage.

192
00:13:52,130 --> 00:13:54,130
Oh my god.

193
00:13:54,130 --> 00:13:56,130
I was a little nervous.

194
00:13:56,130 --> 00:13:58,130
I stood on the stage for sure.

195
00:13:58,130 --> 00:14:02,130
The two of you are standing there?

196
00:14:04,130 --> 00:14:06,130
I was surprised.

197
00:14:06,130 --> 00:14:09,130
I was surprised.

198
00:14:09,130 --> 00:14:13,370
I was a little blank.

199
00:14:13,370 --> 00:14:17,870
There are more people than I thought who
know us.

200
00:14:17,870 --> 00:14:19,870
Okura and Miyazaki.

201
00:14:19,870 --> 00:14:20,870
That's amazing.

202
00:14:20,870 --> 00:14:22,870
I'm glad I was able to come here.

203
00:14:22,870 --> 00:14:24,370
I noticed it and I was happy.

204
00:14:24,370 --> 00:14:25,870
I don't know what this means.

205
00:14:25,870 --> 00:14:26,870
That's amazing.

206
00:14:26,870 --> 00:14:28,870
I'm glad I was able to come to Akizaka.

207
00:14:28,870 --> 00:14:30,870
I didn't know that either.

208
00:14:30,870 --> 00:14:32,870
It's hot.

209
00:14:32,870 --> 00:14:35,870
Everyone is grateful.

210
00:14:35,870 --> 00:14:37,870
It's amazing.

211
00:14:37,870 --> 00:14:41,280
I've been singing and dancing for three
hours.

212
00:14:41,280 --> 00:14:44,280
And the encore is the last song.

213
00:14:44,280 --> 00:14:49,606
I wanted to see more.

214
00:14:49,766 --> 00:14:51,146
She's so good!

215
00:15:05,026 --> 00:15:08,346
There are many similar girls in this
group right?

216
00:15:09,146 --> 00:15:10,246
Yoon-gi is so championship.

217
00:15:10,246 --> 00:15:12,246
Oh, that's right.

218
00:15:12,246 --> 00:15:14,246
That's right.

219
00:15:14,246 --> 00:15:16,246
Oh!

220
00:15:16,246 --> 00:15:18,246
Oh!

221
00:15:18,246 --> 00:15:20,246
Oh!

222
00:15:20,246 --> 00:15:22,246
That's right.

223
00:15:22,246 --> 00:15:28,246
Wow, that's so pretty.

224
00:15:28,246 --> 00:15:31,802
Wow, that's so pretty.

225
00:15:31,802 --> 00:15:36,802
And so, the second day of the Hokkaido
concert is over.

226
00:15:37,802 --> 00:15:39,802
Hokkaido was really good.

227
00:15:39,802 --> 00:15:41,802
It was a good venue.

228
00:15:41,802 --> 00:15:46,802
The atmosphere of the local concert is
different from place to place.

229
00:15:46,802 --> 00:15:47,802
Yes, it's different.

230
00:15:47,802 --> 00:15:50,802
Did you change the set-up a little?

231
00:15:50,802 --> 00:15:51,802
Yes, it's a little different.

232
00:15:51,802 --> 00:15:55,440
You did about three songs in the same
song.

233
00:15:55,440 --> 00:15:57,440
It's a new song.

234
00:15:57,440 --> 00:15:59,440
But the members are also hot, aren't
they?

235
00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:01,440
Aren't their costumes pretty hot?

236
00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:07,802
They don't get all wet, do they?

237
00:16:07,802 --> 00:16:08,802
I think it depends on the situation.

238
00:16:08,802 --> 00:16:09,802
How about you, Aki?

239
00:16:09,802 --> 00:16:11,802
I want you to go around with your
seniors.

240
00:16:11,802 --> 00:16:16,802
Many seniors talked to me behind my
back.

241
00:16:16,802 --> 00:16:22,802
I was hit on the back of my back before
I went on stage.

242
00:16:22,802 --> 00:16:26,802
I did it with a man who puts his soul
into it.

243
00:16:26,802 --> 00:16:29,802
I was asked to do it for the first time
by my junior.

244
00:16:29,802 --> 00:16:32,784
That's how it was.

245
00:16:32,784 --> 00:16:36,784
I always do it before Hina and Ayane.

246
00:16:36,784 --> 00:16:38,784
You ask them to do it.

247
00:16:38,784 --> 00:16:39,284
Yes.

248
00:16:39,284 --> 00:16:40,784
Kikuchi's looks painful.

249
00:16:40,784 --> 00:16:41,784
Kikuchi's looks painful.

250
00:16:41,784 --> 00:16:43,784
I feel like my power is going to
explode.

251
00:16:43,784 --> 00:16:47,784
I saw everyone was standing in line.

252
00:16:47,784 --> 00:16:49,784
I wanted to line up with them.

253
00:16:49,784 --> 00:16:50,784
You didn't line up?

254
00:16:50,784 --> 00:16:51,784
I didn't line up.

255
00:16:51,784 --> 00:16:53,784
So I asked Kakihaji to do it in the next
performance.

256
00:16:53,784 --> 00:16:54,784
Kikuchi's is better.

257
00:16:54,784 --> 00:16:56,784
Why is Sakurajino better?

258
00:16:56,784 --> 00:16:58,784
He hits me hard.

259
00:16:58,784 --> 00:17:00,240
Kikuchi's is better.

260
00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:03,240
It's a chance to get closer to your
seniors.

261
00:17:03,240 --> 00:17:05,240
You can ask your seniors to do it.

262
00:17:05,240 --> 00:17:08,240
I understand. I ask my seniors to do it.

263
00:17:09,240 --> 00:17:13,240
I ask my seniors to give me makeup.

264
00:17:13,240 --> 00:17:15,240
You are so stupid.

265
00:17:16,240 --> 00:17:17,240
Suddenly makeup tools.

266
00:17:17,240 --> 00:17:19,240
It's not good if I don't have makeup
tools.

267
00:17:19,240 --> 00:17:20,240
It's important.

268
00:17:21,240 --> 00:17:23,240
I have to give it to you when you ask
me.

269
00:17:23,240 --> 00:17:29,240
They are giving her makeup tools.

270
00:17:29,712 --> 00:17:37,562
Thank you for your hard work.

271
00:17:37,562 --> 00:17:39,062
I took it like a fool.

272
00:17:39,062 --> 00:17:40,062
You did.

273
00:17:40,062 --> 00:17:44,562
I was so happy to see the audience.

274
00:17:44,562 --> 00:17:46,062
It was so close.

275
00:17:46,062 --> 00:17:47,562
Everyone's face.

276
00:17:47,562 --> 00:17:48,562
Did you get it?

277
00:17:48,562 --> 00:17:49,562
I got it.

278
00:17:49,562 --> 00:17:50,562
I was so close.

279
00:17:50,562 --> 00:17:52,062
Himura-san was so close.

280
00:17:52,062 --> 00:17:53,562
I was so close.

281
00:17:53,562 --> 00:17:55,562
I got a lot of pores.

282
00:17:57,062 --> 00:17:59,062
I didn't mean that.

283
00:18:00,062 --> 00:18:02,062
I got excited once.

284
00:18:02,062 --> 00:18:05,616
I went up the stage during the encore.

285
00:18:05,616 --> 00:18:07,616
Did anyone see it?

286
00:18:07,616 --> 00:18:09,616
On the Unobore beach.

287
00:18:09,616 --> 00:18:10,616
The tour?

288
00:18:10,616 --> 00:18:12,616
No, I went up the stage.

289
00:18:12,616 --> 00:18:13,616
Oh, really?

290
00:18:13,616 --> 00:18:16,616
I thought I was on the stage.

291
00:18:16,616 --> 00:18:18,616
And I took a lot of pictures.

292
00:18:18,616 --> 00:18:19,616
Himura-san?

293
00:18:19,616 --> 00:18:23,616
I took 526 pictures.

294
00:18:24,616 --> 00:18:27,616
I took almost all of them.

295
00:18:27,616 --> 00:18:30,616
I took about 10 pictures of everyone.

296
00:18:30,616 --> 00:18:32,976
I'm sure there's something good.

297
00:18:32,976 --> 00:18:38,776
新しいありますこれだよねトラダいくす俺がね52006

298
00:18:38,776 --> 00:18:46,256
邪魔いたおれのうんだから多分みんなのキメ顔と抑えてると思う

299
00:18:46,256 --> 00:18:48,256
I shoot it on the train.

300
00:18:48,256 --> 00:18:49,256
Oh, really?

301
00:18:49,256 --> 00:18:50,256
Yeah.

302
00:18:50,256 --> 00:18:53,088
You can also learn percentile
programming of Kee's competitions in
Komeenders softeness.

303
00:18:53,088 --> 00:18:55,088
Yeah, we decided to do it.

304
00:18:55,088 --> 00:18:57,088
More than usual.

305
00:18:57,088 --> 00:19:01,088
We're from the same hometown.

306
00:19:01,088 --> 00:19:03,088
It was fun.

307
00:19:03,088 --> 00:19:05,088
Really?

308
00:19:05,088 --> 00:19:07,088
It was great.

309
00:19:07,088 --> 00:19:09,088
It was great.

310
00:19:09,088 --> 00:19:11,088
I'd like you to run to the Jingu.

311
00:19:11,088 --> 00:19:13,088
We'll give you a little bit of a gift.

312
00:19:13,088 --> 00:19:15,088
That's right.

313
00:19:15,088 --> 00:19:21,088
We've prepared a number of people.

314
00:19:21,648 --> 00:19:23,648
This is it.

315
00:19:23,648 --> 00:19:25,648
Wow.

316
00:19:25,648 --> 00:19:27,648
Some of you may know this.

317
00:19:27,648 --> 00:19:31,648
This is Uninametake from Kinokon-okoku,
Hokkaido.

318
00:19:33,648 --> 00:19:37,648
This is very delicious when eaten with
rice.

319
00:19:37,648 --> 00:19:39,648
Yay.

320
00:19:39,648 --> 00:19:42,648
I think it's sold at the airport in
Hokkaido.

321
00:19:42,648 --> 00:19:45,648
We eat rice together during the live
broadcast.

322
00:19:45,648 --> 00:19:49,152
I eat rice because I want to eat it.

323
00:19:49,152 --> 00:19:52,152
There is one for each person.

324
00:19:52,152 --> 00:19:53,152
Please, everyone.

325
00:19:53,152 --> 00:19:56,152
Thank you for the best movie so far.

326
00:19:57,152 --> 00:19:59,152
And, sorry, everyone.

327
00:19:59,152 --> 00:20:01,152
There are many Balsharks.

328
00:20:02,152 --> 00:20:04,152
If it's Balshark, it's Kaizo.

329
00:20:06,152 --> 00:20:08,152
It's a great era.

330
00:20:08,152 --> 00:20:09,152
Do you know Zucchin?

331
00:20:09,152 --> 00:20:10,152
Do you know Zucchin?

332
00:20:10,152 --> 00:20:11,152
No, Zucchin.

333
00:20:11,152 --> 00:20:12,152
Zucchin?

334
00:20:12,152 --> 00:20:13,824
Zucchin?

335
00:20:13,824 --> 00:20:15,824
No, it's not Zucchin.

336
00:20:15,824 --> 00:20:18,824
I thought it was Zucchin, so I shot it
and confirmed it later.

337
00:20:19,824 --> 00:20:21,824
You shot it once?

338
00:20:21,824 --> 00:20:24,824
I was also shown something, but it was
Zucchin.

339
00:20:24,824 --> 00:20:25,824
It was definitely Zucchin.

340
00:20:25,824 --> 00:20:27,824
I did this.

341
00:20:27,824 --> 00:20:28,824
That's right.

342
00:20:28,824 --> 00:20:30,824
There's a lot of that.

343
00:20:30,824 --> 00:20:32,824
It's Zucchin.

344
00:20:32,824 --> 00:20:34,824
I did it like a fool.

345
00:20:36,824 --> 00:20:37,824
I made a mistake.

346
00:20:37,824 --> 00:20:38,824
I also shoot.

347
00:20:38,824 --> 00:20:40,824
I'm going to shoot a lot of Valshack, so
I'm going to shoot this much with
Kaname.

348
00:20:40,824 --> 00:20:42,824
I'm going to shoot a lot of Valshack.

349
00:20:44,378 --> 00:20:46,378
I'm not sure if I can do it.

350
00:20:46,378 --> 00:20:48,378
But you did a good job for two days.

351
00:20:48,378 --> 00:20:50,378
Good luck for the rest of the day.

352
00:20:50,378 --> 00:20:55,898
Thank you for your hard work.

353
00:20:55,898 --> 00:20:57,898
U... U...

354
00:20:57,898 --> 00:20:59,898
U... U...

355
00:20:59,898 --> 00:21:01,898
Uruku Kansha Ego! Uruku Kansha!

356
00:21:01,898 --> 00:21:03,898
Oshin-shi!

357
00:21:03,898 --> 00:21:05,898
Yay!

358
00:21:05,898 --> 00:21:09,434
Uruku Kansha! Yay!

359
00:21:09,434 --> 00:21:12,434
The one that has never been there before
will disappear first.

360
00:21:15,434 --> 00:21:16,434
We ran around and took pictures.

361
00:21:16,434 --> 00:21:17,434
It was fun.

362
00:21:17,434 --> 00:21:20,434
I think everyone was there.

363
00:21:20,434 --> 00:21:27,434
At the end, HIMURA said that he had 526
pictures and I had 5215 pictures.

364
00:21:27,434 --> 00:21:33,434
But when I looked at it again later,
HIMURA also took 1897 pictures.

365
00:21:33,434 --> 00:21:34,434
I took it too.

366
00:21:34,434 --> 00:21:37,680
We took more than 7000 pictures.

367
00:21:37,680 --> 00:21:41,680
Did you think you were good at this
place?

368
00:21:41,680 --> 00:21:42,680
Yes.

369
00:21:42,680 --> 00:21:43,680
Oh, here it is.

370
00:21:43,680 --> 00:21:44,680
Balshark.

371
00:21:44,680 --> 00:21:45,680
Oh, that one.

372
00:21:45,680 --> 00:21:46,680
I was asked to take a very beautiful
picture.

373
00:21:46,680 --> 00:21:48,680
You got that one, right?

374
00:21:48,680 --> 00:21:50,680
I thought I would get it taken.

375
00:21:50,680 --> 00:21:53,680
My girl's room, 01, show me a little.

376
00:21:53,680 --> 00:21:55,680
Look at the beauty.

377
00:21:55,680 --> 00:21:56,680
The beauty is already.

378
00:21:56,680 --> 00:21:58,680
Oh, that's right.

379
00:21:58,680 --> 00:22:02,680
If that's the case, I didn't show up
earlier, but my summer free and easy
number 16.

380
00:22:02,680 --> 00:22:05,680
Oh, this is good.

381
00:22:06,074 --> 00:22:07,074
Yes, like this.

382
00:22:07,074 --> 00:22:08,074
Like a toy box.

383
00:22:09,074 --> 00:22:10,074
I think...

384
00:22:11,074 --> 00:22:12,074
I think...

385
00:22:12,074 --> 00:22:13,074
I think...

386
00:22:13,074 --> 00:22:18,074
I think Tamura, the 8th member of
Rockdaze, is really cute.

387
00:22:19,074 --> 00:22:20,074
Why are you so angry?

388
00:22:20,074 --> 00:22:21,074
Why are you so angry?

389
00:22:22,074 --> 00:22:23,074
Why are you so angry?

390
00:22:23,074 --> 00:22:24,074
No, no, no.

391
00:22:24,074 --> 00:22:25,074
No, no, no.

392
00:22:27,074 --> 00:22:28,074
This is cute.

393
00:22:28,074 --> 00:22:29,594
I think this is cute.

394
00:22:29,594 --> 00:22:31,594
Thank you very much.

395
00:22:31,594 --> 00:22:32,594
This is cute.

396
00:22:32,594 --> 00:22:36,594
I really like the number 04 of G-NOO's
Kanata.

397
00:22:37,594 --> 00:22:39,594
This is the number of the customer.

398
00:22:39,594 --> 00:22:43,594
This is a face that is not a face.

399
00:22:43,594 --> 00:22:45,594
This is good.

400
00:22:45,594 --> 00:22:47,594
I want this.

401
00:22:47,594 --> 00:22:48,594
This is good.

402
00:22:48,594 --> 00:22:50,594
I will check this for 30 yen.

403
00:22:51,594 --> 00:22:52,594
This is good.

404
00:22:52,594 --> 00:22:53,594
What happened?

405
00:22:53,594 --> 00:22:55,594
Can I recommend one?

406
00:22:55,594 --> 00:22:59,232
This is the number of the customer.

407
00:22:59,232 --> 00:23:00,232
8.

408
00:23:00,232 --> 00:23:01,232
You remember it well.

409
00:23:02,232 --> 00:23:03,232
How do you know that?

410
00:23:04,232 --> 00:23:07,232
I think it's Maya's cool moment.

411
00:23:08,232 --> 00:23:09,232
This?

412
00:23:10,232 --> 00:23:12,232
I said it with my mouth.

413
00:23:12,232 --> 00:23:13,232
You know it.

414
00:23:13,232 --> 00:23:15,232
Maya is good.

415
00:23:16,232 --> 00:23:21,232
And the best shot chosen by Banana Man
after a long time.

416
00:23:22,232 --> 00:23:23,232
Both are good.

417
00:23:23,232 --> 00:23:27,552
I can't get out of the key in the future
live.

418
00:23:27,552 --> 00:23:30,552
I'll give you this.

419
00:23:30,552 --> 00:23:31,552
Thank you.

420
00:23:31,552 --> 00:23:33,552
I'll put it on my mouth.

421
00:23:33,552 --> 00:23:34,552
That's good.

422
00:23:34,552 --> 00:23:41,402
It must be on TV duda puchoma and

423
00:23:34,852 --> 00:23:41,402
NON TOKYO STUDIO

424
00:23:41,402 --> 00:23:48,402
The real 3D mask of Kubo who won the
Kimegawa Grand Prix is completed

425
00:23:48,402 --> 00:23:53,402
So tonight, they will do the mask
removal ceremony

426
00:23:53,402 --> 00:23:55,402
Please take the red mask

427
00:23:55,402 --> 00:23:56,402
Please open

428
00:23:56,402 --> 00:24:02,906
The real 3D mask of Kubo who won the
Kimegawa Grand Prix is completed

429
00:24:02,906 --> 00:24:06,906
It's more like a square than I thought.

430
00:24:06,906 --> 00:24:07,906
This is a spider.

431
00:24:07,906 --> 00:24:09,906
Is this me? really?

432
00:24:11,906 --> 00:24:12,906
Amazing.

433
00:24:12,906 --> 00:24:13,906
This is a very good picture.

434
00:24:13,906 --> 00:24:14,906
This is a spider.

435
00:24:14,906 --> 00:24:16,906
Is this me?

436
00:24:16,906 --> 00:24:19,906
Can you guess this?

437
00:24:19,906 --> 00:24:21,906
This is a spider.

438
00:24:21,906 --> 00:24:23,906
This is a spider.

439
00:24:23,906 --> 00:24:25,906
This is similar to Mei.

440
00:24:25,906 --> 00:24:27,906
How about your picture?

441
00:24:27,906 --> 00:24:32,160
I can't help but laugh.

442
00:24:32,160 --> 00:24:33,160
I'm scared.

443
00:24:33,160 --> 00:24:34,160
He suddenly started talking.

444
00:24:34,160 --> 00:24:36,160
I feel like I'm in a department.

445
00:24:36,160 --> 00:24:38,160
I'm a little scared of the daily life.

446
00:24:38,160 --> 00:24:40,160
Hide this side too.

447
00:24:43,160 --> 00:24:45,160
And it's time to make a decision.

448
00:24:45,160 --> 00:24:47,160
I'm a little embarrassed.

449
00:24:47,160 --> 00:24:49,160
Everyone wants it, right?

450
00:24:51,160 --> 00:24:54,160
Under Live's delivery ticket is on sale.

451
00:24:54,160 --> 00:25:00,160
Next week is Bakugai's Okatsu.

452
00:25:03,160 --> 00:25:05,160
I'll take this.

453
00:25:05,160 --> 00:25:06,746
Thank you for watching.

454
00:25:06,746 --> 00:25:08,746
Please support me!

455
00:25:08,746 --> 00:25:12,746
