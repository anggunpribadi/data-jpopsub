4
00:00:07,522 --> 00:00:08,522
I pushed her for no reason

5
00:00:09,522 --> 00:00:10,522
It's started

6
00:00:10,522 --> 00:00:11,522
It's started

7
00:00:12,522 --> 00:00:14,522
So, it's sudden but

8
00:00:14,522 --> 00:00:16,522
Do you know who I am?

9
00:00:16,522 --> 00:00:17,522
Yes

10
00:00:17,522 --> 00:00:18,522
Which one?

11
00:00:19,522 --> 00:00:20,522

00:00:22,522 --> 00:00:25,522
I know you the best too

14
00:00:25,522 --> 00:00:26,522
Really?

15
00:00:27,522 --> 00:00:28,522
I see

16
00:00:28,522 --> 00:00:30,522
Today's topic is

17
00:00:32,522 --> 00:00:34,522
Story survey

18
00:00:34,522 --> 00:00:36,522
Yay!

19
00:00:37,522 --> 00:00:46,522
So, we have to understand ourselves

20
00:00:46,522 --> 00:00:48,522
Yes, we have to tell our stories

21
00:00:49,522 --> 00:00:55,522
So, we asked you 10 questions in advance

22
00:00:55,522 --> 00:00:57,522
Thank you

23
00:00:57,522 --> 00:01:03,522
The member who you think is the most
likely to be the tomato is

24
00:01:03,522 --> 00:01:08,522
The member who you think is the most
likely to be the tomato is

25
00:01:08,522 --> 00:01:10,522
You can choose the 10th place

26
00:01:10,522 --> 00:01:21,522
We have to guess where we are in the
10th place

27
00:01:21,522 --> 00:01:27,522
The difference between the member who
you think is the most likely to be the
tomato is

28
00:01:27,522 --> 00:01:31,522
Then, you might be the tomato

29
00:01:31,522 --> 00:01:33,522
It's embarrassing

30
00:01:33,522 --> 00:01:43,522
We are going to imagine that we are not
the tomato

31
00:01:44,522 --> 00:01:45,522
I'm sorry

32
00:01:45,522 --> 00:01:46,144

00:02:25,824 --> 00:02:28,824
but I want to be athletic

48
00:02:28,824 --> 00:02:31,824

result

54
00:02:45,824 --> 00:02:47,824

00:02:50,824 --> 00:02:52,824

60
00:02:59,824 --> 00:03:01,824
Well...

61
00:03:01,824 --> 00:03:03,824
Well...

62
00:03:05,824 --> 00:03:06,824
I'm a little...

63
00:03:06,824 --> 00:03:07,824
Are you embarrassed?

64
00:03:07,824 --> 00:03:09,824
I'm a good person

65
00:03:09,824 --> 00:03:11,824
I'm saying something very embarrassing

66
00:03:11,824 --> 00:03:13,824

68
00:03:15,824 --> 00:03:17,824

00:03:31,824 --> 00:03:33,824
Next, 1.5th place

78
00:03:33,824 --> 00:03:35,824

79
00:03:35,824 --> 00:03:37,824
Date-san

80
00:03:37,824 --> 00:03:38,824
What?

81
00:03:38,824 --> 00:03:40,824
I'm embarrassed

82
00:03:40,824 --> 00:03:41,824
Really?

83
00:03:41,824 --> 00:03:43,824
I'm embarrassed

84
00:03:43,824 --> 00:03:45,824
I'm embarrassed

85
00:03:45,824 --> 00:03:47,824
I'm surprised

86
00:03:47,824 --> 00:03:49,824
What made me in the 2nd place?

87
00:03:49,824 --> 00:03:50,824
What?

88
00:03:50,824 --> 00:03:52,824
3rd place

89
00:03:54,824 --> 00:03:55,824
Why?

90
00:03:57,824 --> 00:03:58,824
I'm wrong

91
00:03:58,824 --> 00:04:02,824
I'm just a prediction

92
00:04:02,824 --> 00:04:05,824
I'm embarrassed

93
00:04:05,824 --> 00:04:07,824
I'm embarrassed

94
00:04:07,824 --> 00:04:09,824
I'm embarrassed

95
00:04:09,824 --> 00:04:11,824
I'm embarrassed

96
00:04:11,824 --> 00:04:13,824
I'm embarrassed

97
00:04:13,824 --> 00:04:15,824
I'm embarrassed

98
00:04:15,824 --> 00:04:17,824
I'm embarrassed

99
00:04:17,824 --> 00:04:19,824
4th place is

100
00:04:19,824 --> 00:04:21,824

Yuna

110
00:04:39,824 --> 00:04:42,824
I think I know more about her

111
00:04:42,824 --> 00:04:44,824
I think I know more about her

112
00:04:44,824 --> 00:04:46,824
I think I know more about her

113
00:04:46,824 --> 00:04:47,824
I see

114
00:04:47,824 --> 00:04:49,824
2nd question

115
00:04:49,824 --> 00:04:51,824
2nd question

116
00:04:51,824 --> 00:04:53,824
Who is the smartest?

117
00:04:53,824 --> 00:04:55,824
This is...

118
00:04:55,824 --> 00:04:56,288
Who is the smartest?

119
00:04:56,288 --> 00:04:58,288
ウッズ? ウッズ?

120
00:04:58,944 --> 00:05:00,944
It's my turn.

121
00:05:00,944 --> 00:05:02,944
I know.

122
00:05:02,944 --> 00:05:04,944
Ready, go!

123
00:05:04,944 --> 00:05:06,944
I'll start from you.

124
00:05:06,944 --> 00:05:07,944
3rd place is...

125
00:05:07,944 --> 00:05:08,944
4th place is...

126
00:05:08,944 --> 00:05:09,944
2nd place is...

127
00:05:09,944 --> 00:05:11,944
Oh no, it's the highest!

128
00:05:12,944 --> 00:05:14,944
But there's a reason.

129
00:05:14,944 --> 00:05:16,944
I saw a test on YouTube.

130
00:05:16,944 --> 00:05:19,944
I was 2nd place.

131
00:05:19,944 --> 00:05:21,944
Shinjyu was 1st place.

132
00:05:21,944 --> 00:05:25,944
So I think everyone watching this is
thinking about me.

133
00:05:25,944 --> 00:05:28,944
3rd place is the smartest.

134
00:05:30,944 --> 00:05:32,944
3rd place is...

135
00:05:32,944 --> 00:05:38,544
Oh no, oh no, oh no.

136
00:05:38,544 --> 00:05:41,544
Science is a good thing, isn't it?

137
00:05:41,544 --> 00:05:44,544
Science is a good thing.

138
00:05:44,544 --> 00:05:47,544
I think you're smart.

139
00:05:47,544 --> 00:05:49,544
It's like a nuance.

140
00:05:49,544 --> 00:05:51,544
It's a feeling.

141
00:05:51,544 --> 00:05:53,544
It's a feeling.

142
00:05:53,544 --> 00:05:55,544
This is...

143
00:05:55,544 --> 00:05:57,544
It's a joke.

144
00:05:57,544 --> 00:05:58,544
It's a joke.

145
00:05:58,544 --> 00:06:00,544
What's the reason for the second place?

146
00:06:00,544 --> 00:06:03,952
It's a joke.

147
00:06:03,952 --> 00:06:09,952
I prepared this because...

148
00:06:09,952 --> 00:06:11,952
Well, it's just...

149
00:06:11,952 --> 00:06:13,952
Let's make this four.

150
00:06:15,952 --> 00:06:17,952
You forgot to erase it.

151
00:06:17,952 --> 00:06:19,952
You forgot to erase it.

152
00:06:19,952 --> 00:06:21,952
Let's make it three.

153
00:06:21,952 --> 00:06:23,952
Don't try to guess.

154
00:06:23,952 --> 00:06:25,952
Calm down.

155
00:06:25,952 --> 00:06:27,952
This is...

156
00:06:27,952 --> 00:06:31,952
I think it's just normal.

157
00:06:31,952 --> 00:06:35,952
So, I'm in the 9th place.

158
00:06:35,952 --> 00:06:39,952
I thought it would be nice if it was the
middle class.

159
00:06:39,952 --> 00:06:41,952
Please announce the results.

160
00:06:41,952 --> 00:06:43,952
The first place is...

161
00:06:43,952 --> 00:06:45,952
Kichizuka.

162
00:06:47,952 --> 00:06:49,952
The second place is...

163
00:06:49,952 --> 00:06:54,138
Kichizuka.

164
00:06:54,138 --> 00:06:56,138
I'm embarrassed.

165
00:06:57,138 --> 00:06:59,138
I'm embarrassed.

166
00:06:59,138 --> 00:07:01,138
I'm embarrassed.

167
00:07:03,138 --> 00:07:05,138
3rd place is Hazuki.

168
00:07:07,138 --> 00:07:09,138
I think I should die again.

169
00:07:09,138 --> 00:07:10,138
I'm wrong.

170
00:07:10,138 --> 00:07:12,138
4th place is Ritsuki.

171
00:07:15,138 --> 00:07:17,138
I thought it was that stupid.

172
00:07:18,138 --> 00:07:20,138
I'm going to leave the distance.

173
00:07:20,138 --> 00:07:22,138
5th place is Yasumori.

174
00:07:22,138 --> 00:07:24,138
I'm half right.

175
00:07:24,138 --> 00:07:26,138
I'm half right.

176
00:07:26,138 --> 00:07:28,138
I'm embarrassed.

177
00:07:29,138 --> 00:07:31,138
I want to be in the top 10.

178
00:07:31,138 --> 00:07:33,138
Please.

179
00:07:35,138 --> 00:07:37,138
6th place is Tachibana.

180
00:07:37,138 --> 00:07:39,138
I lost to Tachibana.

181
00:07:41,138 --> 00:07:43,138
I'm embarrassed.

182
00:07:43,138 --> 00:07:45,138
7th place is Sakurasu.

183
00:07:45,138 --> 00:07:47,138
I'm embarrassed.

184
00:07:47,138 --> 00:07:49,138
I'm embarrassed.

185
00:07:49,138 --> 00:07:51,138
I'm embarrassed.

186
00:07:52,976 --> 00:07:54,976
you closed it

187
00:08:01,176 --> 00:08:03,076
Why?

188
00:08:03,076 --> 00:08:04,776
That was cute

189
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:08,400
This is...

190
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:10,400
You guys are the weird ones.

191
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:12,400
You guys are the weird ones.

192
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:14,400
But as a result...

193
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:17,400
Let's have a study contest with Iginari-
chan.

194
00:08:17,400 --> 00:08:19,400
Question 3.

195
00:08:19,400 --> 00:08:21,400
Who has the biggest voice?

196
00:08:21,400 --> 00:08:23,400
This is...

197
00:08:23,400 --> 00:08:25,400
Isn't it overwhelming?

198
00:08:25,400 --> 00:08:27,400
But...

199
00:08:27,400 --> 00:08:28,400
Wait, wait, wait.

200
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:30,400
But it's surprisingly out.

201
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:32,400
When we were in the army...

202
00:08:32,400 --> 00:08:35,400
There's a scene where we go, bam!

203
00:08:35,400 --> 00:08:37,400
Ready, go!

204
00:08:37,400 --> 00:08:39,400
Ta-da!

205
00:08:39,400 --> 00:08:41,400
1st place!

206
00:08:41,400 --> 00:08:43,400
7th place!

207
00:08:43,400 --> 00:08:45,400
What is this?

208
00:08:45,400 --> 00:08:47,400
I wonder.

209
00:08:47,400 --> 00:08:49,400
What is it?

210
00:08:49,400 --> 00:08:53,400
I think I'm going to be able to sing.

211
00:08:54,400 --> 00:08:56,400
1st place.

212
00:08:56,400 --> 00:08:58,400
Date-san.

213
00:08:58,400 --> 00:09:00,400
You're happy, aren't you?

214
00:09:00,400 --> 00:09:02,400
I'm happy I got it.

215
00:09:02,400 --> 00:09:04,400
2nd place.

216
00:09:04,400 --> 00:09:06,400
5th place.

217
00:09:06,400 --> 00:09:08,400
It's surprising.

218
00:09:08,400 --> 00:09:10,400
3rd place.

219
00:09:10,400 --> 00:09:12,400
Fujitani-san.

220
00:09:12,400 --> 00:09:14,400
4th place.

221
00:09:14,400 --> 00:09:16,400
Sakura-san.

222
00:09:16,400 --> 00:09:18,400
5th place.

223
00:09:18,400 --> 00:09:20,400
Hazuki-san.

224
00:09:20,400 --> 00:09:22,400
6th place.

225
00:09:22,400 --> 00:09:24,400
Yasamori-san.

226
00:09:24,400 --> 00:09:26,400
7th place.

227
00:09:26,400 --> 00:09:28,400
Ritsuki-san.

228
00:09:28,400 --> 00:09:30,400
8th place.

229
00:09:30,400 --> 00:09:32,400
Kichise-san.

230
00:09:32,400 --> 00:09:34,400
9th place.

231
00:09:34,400 --> 00:09:36,400
What?

232
00:09:36,400 --> 00:09:38,400
Seriously?

233
00:09:38,400 --> 00:09:40,400
I didn't expect this.

234
00:09:40,400 --> 00:09:44,400
I thought the number 1 or 2 would be the
number 10.

235
00:09:44,400 --> 00:09:46,400
I thought so too.

236
00:09:46,400 --> 00:09:50,400
But I think I'm the one who's thought of
being the cutest girl in the world.

237
00:09:50,400 --> 00:09:52,400
Oh no, I'm the loudest one.

238
00:09:54,400 --> 00:09:56,400
Question 4.

239
00:09:56,400 --> 00:09:59,400
Who's the loudest?

240
00:09:59,400 --> 00:10:01,400
Wow.

241
00:10:01,400 --> 00:10:03,400
I think I'm the loudest.

242
00:10:03,400 --> 00:10:08,400
I've never shown my true self in a meal.

243
00:10:08,400 --> 00:10:10,400
Ready, go!

244
00:10:10,400 --> 00:10:12,400
Ta-da!

245
00:10:12,400 --> 00:10:13,400
2nd place.

246
00:10:13,400 --> 00:10:15,400
4th place.

247
00:10:15,400 --> 00:10:17,400
3rd place.

248
00:10:17,400 --> 00:10:19,400
I love meat rice.

249
00:10:19,400 --> 00:10:21,400
I want to be the 2nd place.

250
00:10:21,400 --> 00:10:23,400
I see.

251
00:10:23,400 --> 00:10:25,400
I'm the 4th place.

252
00:10:25,400 --> 00:10:27,400
I don't know myself well.

253
00:10:27,400 --> 00:10:30,400
So I'll try to be in the middle.

254
00:10:30,400 --> 00:10:33,400
I'm not sure.

255
00:10:33,400 --> 00:10:41,400
I think it's because you're saying that
you like sweets.

256
00:10:41,400 --> 00:10:44,400
I think you're the top.

257
00:10:44,400 --> 00:10:46,400
You said you love rice.

258
00:10:46,400 --> 00:10:48,400
Please tell us the result.

259
00:10:48,400 --> 00:10:50,400
1st place.

260
00:10:50,400 --> 00:10:52,400
I'm the first place.

261
00:10:52,400 --> 00:10:54,400
I'm the first place.

262
00:10:54,400 --> 00:10:56,400
2nd place.

263
00:10:56,400 --> 00:10:58,400
3rd place.

264
00:10:58,400 --> 00:11:01,400
I've been guessing for a long time.

265
00:11:01,400 --> 00:11:03,400
You're good.

266
00:11:03,400 --> 00:11:05,400
You know yourself well.

267
00:11:05,400 --> 00:11:07,400
3rd place.

268
00:11:07,400 --> 00:11:09,400
Sakura.

269
00:11:09,400 --> 00:11:11,400
4th place.

270
00:11:11,400 --> 00:11:13,400
Tachibana.

271
00:11:13,400 --> 00:11:15,400
Tachibana is the first place.

272
00:11:15,400 --> 00:11:18,400
I'm the first place.

273
00:11:18,400 --> 00:11:20,400
I'm the last place.

274
00:11:20,400 --> 00:11:22,400
5th place.

275
00:11:22,400 --> 00:11:24,400
Yasunori.

276
00:11:24,400 --> 00:11:26,400
I see.

277
00:11:26,400 --> 00:11:28,400
I'm the first place.

278
00:11:28,400 --> 00:11:30,400
I'm the first place.

279
00:11:30,400 --> 00:11:32,400
6th place.

280
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:34,400
Fujii Kanna.

281
00:11:34,400 --> 00:11:35,400
7th place.

282
00:11:35,400 --> 00:11:36,400
Ritsuki.

283
00:11:36,400 --> 00:11:37,400
8th place.

284
00:11:37,400 --> 00:11:38,400
Kitano.

285
00:11:38,400 --> 00:11:39,400
9th place.

286
00:11:39,400 --> 00:11:42,704
7th place.

287
00:11:42,704 --> 00:11:44,704
Tachibana is not that good.

288
00:11:44,704 --> 00:11:46,704
I agree.

289
00:11:46,704 --> 00:11:48,704
I'm glad I got it right.

290
00:11:48,704 --> 00:11:50,704
Wow.

291
00:11:50,704 --> 00:11:52,704
Ta-da.

292
00:11:52,704 --> 00:11:54,704
You don't know who you are.

293
00:11:54,704 --> 00:11:56,704
Question 5.

294
00:11:56,704 --> 00:12:02,704
Who is the member who hates food the
most?

295
00:12:02,704 --> 00:12:04,704
Have you ever said that in front of
people?

296
00:12:04,704 --> 00:12:06,704
That you hate it.

297
00:12:06,704 --> 00:12:10,704
I've been told not to say that in front
of people.

298
00:12:10,704 --> 00:12:12,704
Come here.

299
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:17,360
What's this?

300
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:22,832
5th place! 7th place!

301
00:12:22,832 --> 00:12:23,832
8th place!

302
00:12:23,832 --> 00:12:27,832
The reason is that you hate natto.

303
00:12:28,832 --> 00:12:33,832
But as you get older, you get to eat
more.

304
00:12:33,832 --> 00:12:37,832
I think that's why you're 5th place.

305
00:12:37,832 --> 00:12:40,832
I don't know.

306
00:12:40,832 --> 00:12:43,832
But you don't seem to have a problem
with it.

307
00:12:43,832 --> 00:12:50,832
I don't hate it, but I don't eat it
because I like it.

308
00:12:50,832 --> 00:12:55,832
It's different from what you think.

309
00:12:55,832 --> 00:12:58,832
So I want to make it a number that I
don't know.

310
00:12:58,832 --> 00:13:01,832
I see.

311
00:13:01,832 --> 00:13:06,832
You don't hate natto.

312
00:13:06,832 --> 00:13:09,832
And you don't hate it because you don't
eat it.

313
00:13:09,832 --> 00:13:12,832
So I'm confident that you'll eat it
again.

314
00:13:12,832 --> 00:13:14,832
1st place!

315
00:13:14,832 --> 00:13:16,832
Ritsuki!

316
00:13:16,832 --> 00:13:18,832
Ritsuki!

317
00:13:18,832 --> 00:13:20,832
Ritsuki?

318
00:13:20,832 --> 00:13:22,832
I don't think so.

319
00:13:22,832 --> 00:13:24,832
What is this?

320
00:13:24,832 --> 00:13:27,832
It's not a matter of time.

321
00:13:27,832 --> 00:13:30,832
It's an image that I think.

322
00:13:30,832 --> 00:13:33,832
2nd place! Sakura!

323
00:13:34,832 --> 00:13:38,832
3rd place! Fujitani!

324
00:13:38,832 --> 00:13:41,832
4th place! Kichisue!

325
00:13:41,832 --> 00:13:45,832
5th place! Date!

326
00:13:45,832 --> 00:13:47,832
I'm so happy.

327
00:13:47,832 --> 00:13:49,832
Why?

328
00:13:49,832 --> 00:13:51,832
I'm scared.

329
00:13:51,832 --> 00:13:54,832
6th place! Hazuki!

330
00:13:54,832 --> 00:13:57,832
7th place! Yasumori!

331
00:13:57,832 --> 00:13:59,832
It's the opposite.

332
00:13:59,832 --> 00:14:01,832
If you exchange it, it's a panel.

333
00:14:01,832 --> 00:14:03,832
Maybe.

334
00:14:03,832 --> 00:14:07,832
7th place! Yasumori!

335
00:14:07,832 --> 00:14:09,832
I got it.

336
00:14:09,832 --> 00:14:11,832
You don't know yourself.

337
00:14:11,832 --> 00:14:13,832
You know yourself best.

338
00:14:13,832 --> 00:14:16,832
If you exchange it, it's a panel.

339
00:14:16,832 --> 00:14:19,832
8th place! Kitano!

340
00:14:19,832 --> 00:14:21,832
I know.

341
00:14:21,832 --> 00:14:23,832
You're right.

342
00:14:23,832 --> 00:14:25,832
You're right.

343
00:14:25,832 --> 00:14:30,224
9th place! Tachibana!

344
00:14:30,224 --> 00:14:38,224
It's hard to decide the order, but it's
different from the real thing.

345
00:14:38,224 --> 00:14:47,216
It's still hard to decide.

346
00:14:47,216 --> 00:14:52,216
Question 6. Who seems to have the most
out-of-work?

347
00:14:52,216 --> 00:14:55,216
I'm not good at guessing the first
place.

348
00:14:55,216 --> 00:14:57,216
I can tell the first place right away.

349
00:14:57,216 --> 00:14:59,216
If I had to guess the first place,

350
00:14:59,216 --> 00:15:01,216
But the results so far are different
from the facts.

351
00:15:01,216 --> 00:15:03,216
That's right.

352
00:15:03,216 --> 00:15:06,216
But I want to believe the facts.

353
00:15:06,216 --> 00:15:08,216
Because it's the truth.

354
00:15:08,216 --> 00:15:09,216
One, two, three!

355
00:15:09,216 --> 00:15:10,216
Chaka-chan!

356
00:15:10,216 --> 00:15:12,216
Yua-chan and Kodaya-chan are in sixth
place!

357
00:15:12,216 --> 00:15:13,216
I'm in third place.

358
00:15:13,216 --> 00:15:15,216
I'm in third place too.

359
00:15:15,216 --> 00:15:18,216
Question 7. What is your favorite
member?

360
00:15:18,216 --> 00:15:20,216
I like her.

361
00:15:20,216 --> 00:15:22,216
I thought someone would notice.

362
00:15:22,216 --> 00:15:24,216
I knew it.

363
00:15:24,216 --> 00:15:25,216
She's cute.

364
00:15:25,216 --> 00:15:28,216
I didn't think she'd be like this.

365
00:15:28,216 --> 00:15:32,216
I don't think I'm very out-of-work.

366
00:15:32,216 --> 00:15:33,216
I'm good at guessing.

367
00:15:33,216 --> 00:15:35,216
I think you're right.

368
00:15:35,216 --> 00:15:38,216
I think I'm older than her.

369
00:15:38,216 --> 00:15:43,216
I think I spend most of my time at home.

370
00:15:43,216 --> 00:15:46,216
I'm in third place.

371
00:15:46,216 --> 00:15:51,216
I'm in third place because I'm in a
famous show.

372
00:15:51,216 --> 00:15:55,216
I'm in the middle of a cafe.

373
00:15:55,216 --> 00:15:58,216
I think I'm in a lot of cafes.

374
00:15:58,216 --> 00:16:00,216
I'm in the middle of a restaurant.

375
00:16:00,216 --> 00:16:05,216
I think I'm in third place because I'm
in the middle of a restaurant.

376
00:16:05,216 --> 00:16:07,216
I'm serious.

377
00:16:07,216 --> 00:16:08,216
Please.

378
00:16:08,216 --> 00:16:09,216
The first place is...

379
00:16:09,216 --> 00:16:11,216
Kazuki-san!

380
00:16:11,216 --> 00:16:13,216
Everyone knows me.

381
00:16:13,216 --> 00:16:15,216
I'm in second place.

382
00:16:15,216 --> 00:16:17,216
Ritsuki-san!

383
00:16:17,216 --> 00:16:18,216
I'm in third place.

384
00:16:18,216 --> 00:16:20,216
Yasumori-san!

385
00:16:20,216 --> 00:16:21,216
It's a start!

386
00:16:21,216 --> 00:16:24,216
I got two in a row.

387
00:16:24,216 --> 00:16:27,216
I was surprised by the previous one.

388
00:16:27,216 --> 00:16:28,216
Of course.

389
00:16:28,216 --> 00:16:30,216
I'm in fourth place.

390
00:16:30,216 --> 00:16:32,216
Date-san!

391
00:16:32,216 --> 00:16:35,216
You're still in high school.

392
00:16:35,216 --> 00:16:36,216
I'm in fifth place.

393
00:16:36,216 --> 00:16:38,216
Kitami-san!

394
00:16:38,216 --> 00:16:40,216
Yay!

395
00:16:40,216 --> 00:16:42,216
I'm in fifth place!

396
00:16:42,216 --> 00:16:44,216
It's like an athening game.

397
00:16:44,216 --> 00:16:47,216
I'm in fifth place.

398
00:16:47,216 --> 00:16:50,216
I'm in the middle of a cafe.

399
00:16:50,216 --> 00:16:52,216
I'm in fifth place.

400
00:16:52,216 --> 00:16:55,216
Fujitani-san is in sixth place.

401
00:16:55,216 --> 00:16:58,216
Sakura-san is in seventh place.

402
00:16:58,216 --> 00:17:02,216
Kichisa-san is in eighth place.

403
00:17:02,216 --> 00:17:05,216
Tachibana-san is in ninth place.

404
00:17:05,216 --> 00:17:05,632
Thank you for watching.

405
00:17:05,632 --> 00:17:09,632
I see. This is the image.

406
00:17:09,632 --> 00:17:12,632
But I don't know the real thing.

407
00:17:12,632 --> 00:17:15,632
Everyone is like that.

408
00:17:15,632 --> 00:17:20,632
I know that there are many unexpected
things, but I don't know.

409
00:17:20,632 --> 00:17:22,632
I'm going to grab it.

410
00:17:22,632 --> 00:17:23,632
I'm going to grab it.

411
00:17:23,632 --> 00:17:24,632
I'm going to grab something. I'm going
to grab it.

412
00:17:24,632 --> 00:17:27,632
Yasumori Waka, please tell me the
answer.

413
00:17:27,632 --> 00:17:30,632
I'm going to grab something with a
spark.

414
00:17:30,632 --> 00:17:31,632
Yasumori Waka, I'm going to grab
something.

415
00:17:31,632 --> 00:17:35,632
Question 7. Who looks the strongest in
the morning?

416
00:17:35,632 --> 00:17:39,632
This is a quick answer.

417
00:17:39,632 --> 00:17:41,632
I'm going to answer.

418
00:17:41,632 --> 00:17:43,632
I'm going to answer.

419
00:17:43,632 --> 00:17:45,632
2, 3, 1.

420
00:17:45,632 --> 00:17:48,632
1, 2, 3 people in the top three.

421
00:17:48,632 --> 00:17:49,632
I think so.

422
00:17:49,632 --> 00:17:52,632
These three are really strong.

423
00:17:52,632 --> 00:17:56,632
I think Yasumori Waka is in first place,
so I chose 2.

424
00:17:56,632 --> 00:17:58,632
I'm in second place.

425
00:17:58,632 --> 00:18:01,632
I'm going to sleep.

426
00:18:01,632 --> 00:18:02,632
No.

427
00:18:02,632 --> 00:18:05,632
You're going to sleep.

428
00:18:05,632 --> 00:18:07,632
You're going to sleep.

429
00:18:07,632 --> 00:18:12,632
I don't sleep deeply when I'm on a trip.

430
00:18:12,632 --> 00:18:16,632
I always wake up early.

431
00:18:16,632 --> 00:18:20,632
I think I'm going to lose to these two.

432
00:18:20,632 --> 00:18:22,632
I chose 3.

433
00:18:22,632 --> 00:18:25,632
I'm very honest.

434
00:18:25,632 --> 00:18:27,632
I'm not sleeping.

435
00:18:27,632 --> 00:18:32,632
I sometimes pack my luggage and leave
when I wake up.

436
00:18:32,632 --> 00:18:36,632
I don't think this is the image of the
person.

437
00:18:36,632 --> 00:18:38,632
I'm not hurt.

438
00:18:38,632 --> 00:18:40,632
I'm very honest.

439
00:18:40,632 --> 00:18:42,632
Please tell me the answer.

440
00:18:42,632 --> 00:18:45,632
1, Yasumori Waka.

441
00:18:45,632 --> 00:18:47,632
Thank you.

442
00:18:47,632 --> 00:18:50,632
2, Kitami.

443
00:18:50,632 --> 00:18:53,632
This is the opposite.

444
00:18:53,632 --> 00:18:54,632
This is the opposite.

445
00:18:54,632 --> 00:18:56,632
Next is Kurewa.

446
00:18:56,632 --> 00:18:59,632
3, Yasumori Waka.

447
00:19:00,192 --> 00:19:02,192
I think it's Soda Asayoshi.

448
00:19:04,192 --> 00:19:06,192
It's not Sada Ichi.

449
00:19:06,192 --> 00:19:07,192
4th place.

450
00:19:07,192 --> 00:19:08,192
Datesu no Nen.

451
00:19:08,192 --> 00:19:10,192
Did you notice that I've been sleeping
recently?

452
00:19:11,192 --> 00:19:13,192
But it's not the top.

453
00:19:13,192 --> 00:19:14,192
If it's the top.

454
00:19:14,192 --> 00:19:16,192
I'm looking forward to the bottom.

455
00:19:17,192 --> 00:19:18,192
5th place.

456
00:19:18,192 --> 00:19:19,192
Kichisetsu.

457
00:19:19,192 --> 00:19:21,192
Oh, no.

458
00:19:21,192 --> 00:19:22,192
6th place.

459
00:19:22,192 --> 00:19:23,192
Hazuki.

460
00:19:25,192 --> 00:19:26,192
7th place.

461
00:19:26,192 --> 00:19:27,192
Fujikawa Natsuki.

462
00:19:27,192 --> 00:19:29,904
Hachi.

463
00:19:29,904 --> 00:19:32,704
Ritsuki.

464
00:19:32,704 --> 00:19:35,552
9th place, Sakurazawa.

465
00:19:35,552 --> 00:19:39,552
It's not good to put it in the top 10.

466
00:19:39,552 --> 00:19:41,552
It's not good.

467
00:19:41,552 --> 00:19:43,552
It's different for each person.

468
00:19:43,552 --> 00:19:47,552
Weakness and strength.

469
00:19:47,552 --> 00:19:49,552
It's different for each person.

470
00:19:49,552 --> 00:19:51,552
The image...

471
00:19:51,552 --> 00:19:53,552
The image...

472
00:19:53,552 --> 00:19:55,552
I can't follow it.

473
00:19:55,552 --> 00:19:57,552
Who is it?

474
00:19:57,552 --> 00:19:59,552
Question 8.

475
00:19:59,552 --> 00:20:01,552
The person with the most luggage.

476
00:20:01,552 --> 00:20:04,552
This is the first person, right?

477
00:20:04,552 --> 00:20:06,552
Yes.

478
00:20:06,552 --> 00:20:08,552
I'm sure it's me.

479
00:20:08,552 --> 00:20:10,128
Ta-da!

480
00:20:10,128 --> 00:20:11,128
9th place!

481
00:20:11,128 --> 00:20:12,128
5th place!

482
00:20:12,128 --> 00:20:13,128
7th place!

483
00:20:13,128 --> 00:20:15,128
You guys are pretty behind.

484
00:20:15,128 --> 00:20:17,128
I thought I was the least one.

485
00:20:17,128 --> 00:20:18,128
I was surprised.

486
00:20:18,128 --> 00:20:20,128
I thought you were the least one.

487
00:20:20,128 --> 00:20:22,128
You were like, is that all you have?

488
00:20:22,128 --> 00:20:23,128
Yeah, I was told that.

489
00:20:23,128 --> 00:20:26,128
Even if everyone's suitcases are big,

490
00:20:26,128 --> 00:20:28,128
I always use the small ones.

491
00:20:28,128 --> 00:20:29,128
I see.

492
00:20:29,128 --> 00:20:31,128
I'm not good at having a lot of luggage.

493
00:20:31,128 --> 00:20:33,128
I see.

494
00:20:33,128 --> 00:20:36,128
I have a lot of luggage during the live
show,

495
00:20:36,128 --> 00:20:39,128
but I don't have much privacy.

496
00:20:39,128 --> 00:20:43,128
That's why I think I'm in the middle.

497
00:20:43,128 --> 00:20:46,128
You're really good at making decisions.

498
00:20:46,128 --> 00:20:49,128
You're the 7th place with a woman's gut
feeling.

499
00:20:49,128 --> 00:20:50,128
What's the correct answer?

500
00:20:50,128 --> 00:20:52,128
1st place!

501
00:20:52,128 --> 00:20:53,128
Tachibana!

502
00:20:53,128 --> 00:20:54,128
This is...

503
00:20:54,128 --> 00:20:55,128
I think it's a good one.

504
00:20:55,128 --> 00:20:57,128
You have a lot of shoulders.

505
00:20:59,128 --> 00:21:00,128
2nd place!

506
00:21:00,128 --> 00:21:01,128
Mitsuki!

507
00:21:01,128 --> 00:21:03,128
Oh!

508
00:21:03,128 --> 00:21:04,128
3rd place!

509
00:21:04,128 --> 00:21:05,128
Fujitani!

510
00:21:05,128 --> 00:21:07,128
I think it's the first place.

511
00:21:07,128 --> 00:21:08,128
4th place!

512
00:21:08,128 --> 00:21:09,128
Sakurasu!

513
00:21:09,128 --> 00:21:10,128
Hmm...

514
00:21:10,128 --> 00:21:11,128
5th place!

515
00:21:11,128 --> 00:21:12,128
Hazuki!

516
00:21:12,128 --> 00:21:13,128
Oh!

517
00:21:13,128 --> 00:21:14,128
6th place!

518
00:21:14,128 --> 00:21:15,128
Kitami!

519
00:21:15,128 --> 00:21:16,128
Oh!

520
00:21:16,128 --> 00:21:18,128
It's not much different.

521
00:21:18,128 --> 00:21:19,128
Oh!

522
00:21:19,128 --> 00:21:20,128
6th place!

523
00:21:20,128 --> 00:21:21,128
Yay!

524
00:21:21,128 --> 00:21:22,128
I got it!

525
00:21:22,128 --> 00:21:23,128
You got it!

526
00:21:23,128 --> 00:21:24,128
That's great.

527
00:21:24,128 --> 00:21:25,128
7th place!

528
00:21:25,128 --> 00:21:26,128
Kichisei!

529
00:21:26,128 --> 00:21:27,128
Oh!

530
00:21:27,128 --> 00:21:28,128
8th place!

531
00:21:28,128 --> 00:21:29,128
Yasumori!

532
00:21:29,128 --> 00:21:30,128
Oh!

533
00:21:30,128 --> 00:21:31,128
Okay!

534
00:21:31,128 --> 00:21:33,128
You can do it!

535
00:21:33,128 --> 00:21:35,128
Look!

536
00:21:35,128 --> 00:21:38,128
Oh!

537
00:21:38,128 --> 00:21:39,128
I can't believe it.

538
00:21:39,128 --> 00:21:41,128
It's a twisted 8.

539
00:21:41,128 --> 00:21:42,128
Okay!

540
00:21:42,128 --> 00:21:44,128
But only one is different.

541
00:21:44,128 --> 00:21:45,128
9th place!

542
00:21:45,128 --> 00:21:46,128
Date-san!

543
00:21:46,128 --> 00:21:47,128
I got it!

544
00:21:47,128 --> 00:21:48,128
Why?

545
00:21:49,128 --> 00:21:51,128
It's exactly as I imagined.

546
00:21:51,128 --> 00:21:52,128
It was exactly as I imagined.

547
00:21:52,128 --> 00:21:53,128
Question 9.

548
00:21:53,128 --> 00:21:57,128
Who is the member who seems to be most
impulsive?

549
00:21:57,128 --> 00:21:58,128
Wow!

550
00:21:58,128 --> 00:22:00,128
I'm worried about this.

551
00:22:00,128 --> 00:22:02,128
Ready, go!

552
00:22:02,128 --> 00:22:03,128
5th place!

553
00:22:03,128 --> 00:22:04,128
9th place!

554
00:22:04,128 --> 00:22:05,128
6th place!

555
00:22:05,128 --> 00:22:06,128
Wow!

556
00:22:06,128 --> 00:22:07,128
Why?

557
00:22:07,128 --> 00:22:10,128
I have an image that I used to buy a lot
of things.

558
00:22:10,128 --> 00:22:11,128
I have an image.

559
00:22:11,128 --> 00:22:15,128
I have an image that I used to buy a lot
of things.

560
00:22:15,128 --> 00:22:18,128
But I think I'll just buy it.

561
00:22:18,128 --> 00:22:20,128
I'll buy it if I want it.

562
00:22:20,128 --> 00:22:23,128
It's been a month since I bought it
online.

563
00:22:23,128 --> 00:22:24,128
I'll buy it.

564
00:22:25,128 --> 00:22:27,128
