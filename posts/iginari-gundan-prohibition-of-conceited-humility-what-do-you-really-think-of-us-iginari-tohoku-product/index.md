[Prohibition of conceited humility] What do you really think of us...? [Iginari Tohoku product]

How much do you understand yourself?
The image of yourself that someone sees,
I thought that there are quite a few things that are far from what I think!

So in an Instagram survey,
10 questions about members Thank you for your cooperation!

And in all questions, the members are ranked 1st to 9th!
For each question, guess what rank you are!

Even if you predict the ranking too high or too low, the result will be embarrassing...
Is there a gap between the image of yourself and Minasan?
