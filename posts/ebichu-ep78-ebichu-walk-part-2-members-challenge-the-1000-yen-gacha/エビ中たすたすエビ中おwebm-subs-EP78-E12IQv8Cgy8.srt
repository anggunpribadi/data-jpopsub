1
00:00:00,250 --> 00:00:08,250
This time, we will continue from last
week, the 7th season's special, Ebi-Chu-
Tasu, Kameido.

2
00:00:09,250 --> 00:00:12,250
We will walk around the town of Kameido.

3
00:00:17,250 --> 00:00:20,250
What are they shooting?

4
00:00:20,250 --> 00:00:27,250
Ebi-Chu-Tasu, Start!

5
00:00:28,504 --> 00:00:37,504
Ikemo Nattemo Irarenai Modokashii Kanjou
Kakeru Hyaku

6
00:00:37,504 --> 00:00:40,090
Maia powdered

7
00:00:40,090 --> 00:00:42,090
I'm so into you that I can't stop

8
00:00:42,090 --> 00:00:47,090
What should I do with my heart that's
filled with you?

9
00:00:48,090 --> 00:00:52,090
Monotrium, monotrium, monotrium, middle
school

10
00:00:53,090 --> 00:00:57,090
Add all kinds of things to private Ebisu
middle school

11
00:00:57,090 --> 00:01:02,090
Ebisu middle school

12
00:01:04,096 --> 00:01:09,096
This program is provided by the sponsor
you see.

13
00:01:19,056 --> 00:01:23,056
The two teams are always separated when
moving cars.

14
00:01:23,056 --> 00:01:27,056
The team that doesn't get drunk on cars
and the team that gets drunk on cars.

15
00:01:27,056 --> 00:01:33,056
They are separated into mysterious teams
and go on a walk around the Kameido
town, Brali.

16
00:01:34,056 --> 00:01:38,056
Last time, they were invited to smell
and eat bread.

17
00:01:39,056 --> 00:01:45,056
At the recycle shop, they hold a cheap
coordination battle with Yasumoto.

18
00:01:45,056 --> 00:01:45,984
The two teams are always separated when
moving cars and the team that doesn't
get drunk on cars and the team that gets
drunk on cars.

19
00:01:46,984 --> 00:01:51,984
The team that got drunk on cars and
bought a lot of old clothes is the Monja
shop.

20
00:01:52,984 --> 00:01:53,984
I like this kind of seat.

21
00:01:56,984 --> 00:01:58,984
Excuse me, do you have any
recommendations?

22
00:01:59,984 --> 00:02:03,984
The most recommended is the turtle
Monja.

23
00:02:04,984 --> 00:02:05,984
Turtle Monja.

24
00:02:06,984 --> 00:02:09,984
And the one that is popular with girls
is tomato mochi.

25
00:02:09,984 --> 00:02:13,984
Hey, what's wrong?

26
00:02:14,984 --> 00:02:17,984
Turtle Monja and red tomato Monja.

27
00:02:18,984 --> 00:02:19,984
Tomato?

28
00:02:20,984 --> 00:02:22,984
Choose one from each team.

29
00:02:23,984 --> 00:02:24,984
Have you decided?

30
00:02:25,984 --> 00:02:26,984
What's that?

31
00:02:27,984 --> 00:02:28,984
Turtle Monja.

32
00:02:29,984 --> 00:02:30,984
Please give me a T.M.

33
00:02:34,984 --> 00:02:37,984
It's a T.M. for Daigo-san.

34
00:02:37,984 --> 00:02:41,984
The one who is eating the red tomato
Monja.

35
00:02:42,984 --> 00:02:43,984
Please give me a T.M.

36
00:02:44,984 --> 00:02:45,984
It's a T.M. for Turtle Monja.

37
00:02:46,984 --> 00:02:48,984
Please give me a M.T.M.

38
00:02:49,984 --> 00:02:51,984
Do you usually eat Monja?

39
00:02:52,984 --> 00:02:53,984
Yes, we do.

40
00:02:54,984 --> 00:02:55,984
Can you make it?

41
00:02:56,984 --> 00:02:58,984
Riko-chan is pretty good at it.

42
00:02:59,984 --> 00:03:01,984
Can you cook?

43
00:03:02,984 --> 00:03:03,984
I said no.

44
00:03:03,984 --> 00:03:07,984
But she is good at it.

45
00:03:08,984 --> 00:03:09,984
Nakayama?

46
00:03:10,984 --> 00:03:11,984
I can make it.

47
00:03:12,984 --> 00:03:15,984
I can make it if I have a good
technique.

48
00:03:16,984 --> 00:03:17,984
That's a big deal.

49
00:03:18,984 --> 00:03:20,984
Why can you make Monja?

50
00:03:21,984 --> 00:03:23,984
I used to go to a lot of Monja when I
was a kid.

51
00:03:24,984 --> 00:03:25,984
Nakayama is good at it.

52
00:03:26,984 --> 00:03:27,984
Kashiwagi is good at it.

53
00:03:28,984 --> 00:03:29,984
He is good at it.

54
00:03:30,984 --> 00:03:31,984
He is called a monk.

55
00:03:31,984 --> 00:03:32,984
He is called a monk.

56
00:03:33,984 --> 00:03:36,984
He made everything for us when we went
to eat.

57
00:03:37,984 --> 00:03:38,984
Can you make Kashiwagi?

58
00:03:39,984 --> 00:03:40,984
I love Monja.

59
00:03:41,984 --> 00:03:44,984
I didn't expect that you can't make
Monja.

60
00:03:45,984 --> 00:03:46,984
I can't cook, but I can make Monja.

61
00:03:47,984 --> 00:03:48,984
You said you can't cook.

62
00:03:49,984 --> 00:03:50,984
I can't.

63
00:03:51,984 --> 00:03:52,984
Can you cook?

64
00:03:53,984 --> 00:03:54,984
I can't.

65
00:03:55,984 --> 00:03:57,984
Wait, you have a master.

66
00:03:58,984 --> 00:03:59,984
Yasumoto is your master.

67
00:03:59,984 --> 00:04:00,984
Yasumoto is your master.

68
00:04:01,984 --> 00:04:03,984
He made Monja for us when we went to
eat.

69
00:04:04,984 --> 00:04:05,984
Can you make Yasumoto?

70
00:04:06,984 --> 00:04:07,984
I can't cook, but I can make Monja.

71
00:04:08,984 --> 00:04:09,984
You are clumsy.

72
00:04:10,984 --> 00:04:13,984
Which one is better? Yasumoto or
Kashiwagi?

73
00:04:14,984 --> 00:04:15,984
I want to say it clearly.

74
00:04:16,984 --> 00:04:17,984
You should say it clearly.

75
00:04:18,984 --> 00:04:19,984
I am a warrior.

76
00:04:20,984 --> 00:04:23,984
But he is my disciple.

77
00:04:24,984 --> 00:04:25,984
Here it comes.

78
00:04:26,984 --> 00:04:27,984
It's a turtle.

79
00:04:27,984 --> 00:04:28,984
It's a turtle.

80
00:04:28,984 --> 00:04:33,040
DM! DM!

81
00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:36,040
It's a turtle!

82
00:04:36,040 --> 00:04:38,040
I thought it was a turtle meat!

83
00:04:38,040 --> 00:04:41,040
It's a turtle shape!

84
00:04:42,040 --> 00:04:43,040
Cute!

85
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:45,040
There's a small turtle and a big turtle!

86
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:48,040
Amazing!

87
00:04:48,640 --> 00:04:50,640
Hello!

88
00:04:50,640 --> 00:04:52,640
Thank you!

89
00:04:52,640 --> 00:04:54,640
What are you doing with this big thing?

90
00:04:54,640 --> 00:04:56,640
That's the Tomatomonja!

91
00:04:56,640 --> 00:04:58,640
What are you doing?

92
00:04:58,640 --> 00:05:01,640
Please make two groups of Tomatomonja!

93
00:05:01,640 --> 00:05:02,640
Yes!

94
00:05:02,640 --> 00:05:10,640
Let's go to see their skill of making
Monjayaki!

95
00:05:10,640 --> 00:05:13,640
Toma-kun, how do you make it?

96
00:05:13,640 --> 00:05:14,640
Like a UFO catcher!

97
00:05:14,640 --> 00:05:17,640
Ta-da!

98
00:05:17,640 --> 00:05:18,256
Oh!

99
00:05:19,256 --> 00:05:20,256
Please add oil.

100
00:05:20,256 --> 00:05:22,256
Please add oil a little bit.

101
00:05:22,256 --> 00:05:23,256
Is it OK?

102
00:05:23,256 --> 00:05:24,256
Yes.

103
00:05:25,256 --> 00:05:27,256
It's not put, it's dropped.

104
00:05:28,256 --> 00:05:30,256
Chie-san, please crush it.

105
00:05:30,256 --> 00:05:31,256
Me?

106
00:05:31,256 --> 00:05:32,256
It's OK to crush it.

107
00:05:32,256 --> 00:05:35,256
No one wants to see me making it.

108
00:05:35,256 --> 00:05:36,256
I want to see it.

109
00:05:36,256 --> 00:05:37,256
I want to see it.

110
00:05:40,256 --> 00:05:41,256
Do your best.

111
00:05:41,256 --> 00:05:43,256
Be careful, it's bouncing.

112
00:05:43,256 --> 00:05:44,256
That's right.

113
00:05:44,256 --> 00:05:45,256
It's OK because it's there.

114
00:05:45,256 --> 00:05:46,256
It's there, but...

115
00:05:46,256 --> 00:05:47,256
It smells good.

116
00:05:47,256 --> 00:05:48,256
What kind of smell?

117
00:05:48,256 --> 00:05:49,256
It smells like tomato.

118
00:05:49,256 --> 00:05:50,256
Thank you.

119
00:05:50,256 --> 00:05:51,256
Grilled tomato.

120
00:05:51,256 --> 00:05:52,256
Grilled tomato.

121
00:05:53,256 --> 00:05:54,256
More, more.

122
00:05:54,256 --> 00:05:56,256
You have to cut it more.

123
00:05:56,256 --> 00:05:58,256
There is tomato underneath.

124
00:05:58,256 --> 00:05:59,256
There is tomato underneath.

125
00:05:59,256 --> 00:06:00,256
There is tomato underneath.

126
00:06:00,256 --> 00:06:01,256
What is that?

127
00:06:01,256 --> 00:06:03,256
It's like minced meat.

128
00:06:03,256 --> 00:06:04,256
Minced meat.

129
00:06:04,256 --> 00:06:05,256
It's hot.

130
00:06:05,256 --> 00:06:06,256
It's OK.

131
00:06:06,256 --> 00:06:07,256
You can do your best.

132
00:06:07,256 --> 00:06:08,256
It's hot.

133
00:06:08,256 --> 00:06:09,256
Is it OK?

134
00:06:09,256 --> 00:06:10,256
Is it OK?

135
00:06:10,256 --> 00:06:11,256
Not yet?

136
00:06:11,256 --> 00:06:12,256
How is it?

137
00:06:12,256 --> 00:06:13,256
Please put the meat first.

138
00:06:13,256 --> 00:06:15,256
Do you mix it with tomato?

139
00:06:17,256 --> 00:06:19,256
The staffs are listening to you.

140
00:06:19,256 --> 00:06:21,256
I'm listening.

141
00:06:21,256 --> 00:06:22,256
It smells good.

142
00:06:22,256 --> 00:06:23,256
It smells good.

143
00:06:23,256 --> 00:06:24,256
Do you want to cut it?

144
00:06:24,256 --> 00:06:25,256
What is that?

145
00:06:25,256 --> 00:06:27,776
Please subscribe to this channel.

146
00:06:28,776 --> 00:06:29,776
It's quite cut here.

147
00:06:29,776 --> 00:06:31,776
You can do it.

148
00:06:31,776 --> 00:06:34,776
Look, she's already using her arms to
cut the kashiwagi.

149
00:06:34,776 --> 00:06:36,776
Because it's a kashiwagi.

150
00:06:36,776 --> 00:06:38,776
You're making a donut.

151
00:06:38,776 --> 00:06:39,776
I'm going to make a donut.

152
00:06:39,776 --> 00:06:40,776
You're making a donut.

153
00:06:40,776 --> 00:06:42,776
Look, she's almost done.

154
00:06:42,776 --> 00:06:43,776
It's looking good.

155
00:06:43,776 --> 00:06:44,776
Don't you have to mix it first?

156
00:06:44,776 --> 00:06:45,776
Do I have to mix this?

157
00:06:45,776 --> 00:06:47,776
Look, she's making a donut.

158
00:06:47,776 --> 00:06:48,776
I'm making a donut.

159
00:06:48,776 --> 00:06:50,776
The athlete is doing her best.

160
00:06:50,776 --> 00:06:51,776
I'm doing my best.

161
00:06:51,776 --> 00:06:52,776
Are you okay?

162
00:06:52,776 --> 00:06:55,776
It's not like you're going to make it
faster.

163
00:06:55,776 --> 00:06:57,776
I hope it's delicious.

164
00:06:57,776 --> 00:06:58,776
That's right.

165
00:06:58,776 --> 00:06:59,776
It smells good.

166
00:07:00,776 --> 00:07:02,776
It looks delicious.

167
00:07:02,776 --> 00:07:04,776
Can you say something to the other team?

168
00:07:04,776 --> 00:07:05,776
I'm sorry.

169
00:07:05,776 --> 00:07:07,776
I'm sorry.

170
00:07:07,776 --> 00:07:09,776
I have to do it properly because I have
a clam.

171
00:07:09,776 --> 00:07:10,776
Thank you.

172
00:07:10,776 --> 00:07:12,776
I can't eat clams.

173
00:07:12,776 --> 00:07:13,776
I'll eat it.

174
00:07:13,776 --> 00:07:14,776
Thank you.

175
00:07:14,776 --> 00:07:15,776
I don't need a box.

176
00:07:15,776 --> 00:07:16,776
I'll eat it.

177
00:07:16,776 --> 00:07:17,776
Thank you.

178
00:07:17,776 --> 00:07:19,776
I'll eat squid, too.

179
00:07:19,776 --> 00:07:21,776
The athlete is doing her best.

180
00:07:21,776 --> 00:07:25,776
How can I make a donut?

181
00:07:25,776 --> 00:07:26,776
You can mix it a little more.

182
00:07:26,776 --> 00:07:27,776
Thank you.

183
00:07:27,776 --> 00:07:29,776
It's going well.

184
00:07:29,776 --> 00:07:30,776
It's going well.

185
00:07:30,776 --> 00:07:33,776
I have to do it properly because I have
a clam.

186
00:07:33,776 --> 00:07:35,776
I'm worried about the clam's fire.

187
00:07:35,776 --> 00:07:36,776
The clam's fire.

188
00:07:36,776 --> 00:07:38,776
It's true that the clam's fire is like
that.

189
00:07:38,776 --> 00:07:40,776
I'm worried if I get a stomachache.

190
00:07:40,776 --> 00:07:42,776
I'll put it in.

191
00:07:42,776 --> 00:07:45,776
Then, hold it down.

192
00:07:45,776 --> 00:07:49,776
I feel like they're really used to it.

193
00:07:49,776 --> 00:07:51,776
I feel like they're really used to it.

194
00:07:51,776 --> 00:07:53,776
I think it's going to be fine.

195
00:07:53,776 --> 00:08:00,112
Please subscribe to our channel.

196
00:08:01,112 --> 00:08:03,112
It's a mix.

197
00:08:03,112 --> 00:08:04,112
It's good.

198
00:08:04,112 --> 00:08:05,112
It's good.

199
00:08:05,112 --> 00:08:06,112
It's coming out.

200
00:08:06,112 --> 00:08:07,112
It's coming out.

201
00:08:07,112 --> 00:08:09,112
Don't give up.

202
00:08:09,112 --> 00:08:10,112
It's a mix.

203
00:08:10,112 --> 00:08:12,112
She mixed it.

204
00:08:12,112 --> 00:08:13,112
It's crispy.

205
00:08:13,112 --> 00:08:14,112
It's a mix.

206
00:08:14,112 --> 00:08:15,112
It's good.

207
00:08:15,112 --> 00:08:16,112
She mixed it.

208
00:08:16,112 --> 00:08:18,112
It's a mix.

209
00:08:18,112 --> 00:08:19,112
There's no hole.

210
00:08:19,112 --> 00:08:21,112
There's no place to spill.

211
00:08:21,112 --> 00:08:23,112
It's meaningless to make a dote at
first.

212
00:08:23,112 --> 00:08:24,112
She mixed it right away.

213
00:08:24,112 --> 00:08:25,112
It's good.

214
00:08:25,112 --> 00:08:26,112
It's good.

215
00:08:27,112 --> 00:08:30,112
It's almost done.

216
00:08:30,112 --> 00:08:35,984
Both of them look delicious.

217
00:08:36,984 --> 00:08:38,984
Let's eat!

218
00:08:38,984 --> 00:08:40,984
It's a little burnt

219
00:08:40,984 --> 00:08:42,984
It looks hot

220
00:08:42,984 --> 00:08:44,984
It's definitely hot

221
00:08:49,984 --> 00:08:51,984
It's how to take it out

222
00:08:54,984 --> 00:08:56,984
It's delicious. It's just right

223
00:08:57,984 --> 00:08:59,984
It's just right

224
00:08:59,984 --> 00:09:05,984
It's just right

225
00:09:05,984 --> 00:09:07,984
It's delicious

226
00:09:08,984 --> 00:09:10,984
Tomatoes go well together

227
00:09:10,984 --> 00:09:12,984
It's delicious

228
00:09:12,984 --> 00:09:14,984
Tomatoes are delicious

229
00:09:14,984 --> 00:09:16,984
The burnt taste is just right

230
00:09:16,984 --> 00:09:18,984
I'm curious about the tomatoes

231
00:09:18,984 --> 00:09:20,984
Come here

232
00:09:20,984 --> 00:09:22,984
It looks delicious

233
00:09:22,984 --> 00:09:24,984
It's delicious

234
00:09:24,984 --> 00:09:26,984
Please excuse me

235
00:09:26,984 --> 00:09:28,984
Don't forget to record

236
00:09:28,984 --> 00:09:30,984
This much?

237
00:09:30,984 --> 00:09:32,984
Let's eat together

238
00:09:32,984 --> 00:09:34,984
Bring it

239
00:09:34,984 --> 00:09:36,984
Bring this one

240
00:09:36,984 --> 00:09:38,984
What is it?

241
00:09:38,984 --> 00:09:40,984
Monja

242
00:09:40,984 --> 00:09:42,984
What is it?

243
00:09:42,984 --> 00:09:48,984
After eating, they went to Kameido
station

244
00:09:50,936 --> 00:09:51,936
It was delicious

245
00:09:52,936 --> 00:09:53,936
I want to eat it

246
00:09:53,936 --> 00:09:55,936
You can't eat it anymore, can you?

247
00:09:55,936 --> 00:09:57,936
I think I can eat it

248
00:09:58,936 --> 00:09:59,936
Are you OK?

249
00:09:59,936 --> 00:10:00,936
I'm totally fine

250
00:10:00,936 --> 00:10:01,936
I think I'm fine

251
00:10:02,936 --> 00:10:03,936
Look!

252
00:10:04,936 --> 00:10:06,936
Kameido Gyoza

253
00:10:07,936 --> 00:10:08,936
It's true

254
00:10:08,936 --> 00:10:09,936
Kameido Gyoza

255
00:10:09,936 --> 00:10:10,936
Let's go!

256
00:10:11,162 --> 00:10:12,162
Really?

257
00:10:12,162 --> 00:10:13,162
Can you still eat?

258
00:10:13,162 --> 00:10:14,162
Yes, I can.

259
00:10:14,162 --> 00:10:16,162
Can you really eat?

260
00:10:16,162 --> 00:10:17,162
Yes.

261
00:10:17,162 --> 00:10:19,162
You look more energetic than when you
were hungry.

262
00:10:19,162 --> 00:10:20,162
Yes, I can.

263
00:10:20,162 --> 00:10:21,162
Can you really eat?

264
00:10:21,162 --> 00:10:23,162
I'm eating now. I want to eat dumplings.

265
00:10:23,162 --> 00:10:25,162
I see. It smells good.

266
00:10:25,162 --> 00:10:27,162
Wow, it has a good atmosphere.

267
00:10:27,162 --> 00:10:28,162
It's good.

268
00:10:28,162 --> 00:10:30,162
Kobayashi, please.

269
00:10:30,162 --> 00:10:31,162
Please.

270
00:10:31,162 --> 00:10:33,162
Take this.

271
00:10:33,162 --> 00:10:34,162
Oh, no.

272
00:10:34,162 --> 00:10:36,162
I think it's better not to take it.

273
00:10:37,162 --> 00:10:38,162
I'll wait.

274
00:10:38,162 --> 00:10:40,162
It's a program.

275
00:10:40,162 --> 00:10:41,162
Let's go.

276
00:10:41,162 --> 00:10:43,162
I think we can go to the station if we
go this way.

277
00:10:43,162 --> 00:10:45,162
Let's go to the train station.

278
00:10:45,162 --> 00:10:47,162
Let's hide there.

279
00:10:47,162 --> 00:10:48,162
Good idea.

280
00:10:48,162 --> 00:10:49,162
Let's hide here.

281
00:10:53,162 --> 00:10:54,162
Hey, hey, hey.

282
00:10:54,162 --> 00:10:55,162
They are gone.

283
00:10:55,162 --> 00:10:57,162
They are not saying, Hey.

284
00:10:57,162 --> 00:10:58,162
Really?

285
00:10:58,162 --> 00:11:01,162
Where did they go?

286
00:11:01,162 --> 00:11:02,162
The manager said,

287
00:11:02,162 --> 00:11:03,162
Yo is going.

288
00:11:03,162 --> 00:11:04,162
Yo?

289
00:11:04,162 --> 00:11:07,024
I'm tired.

290
00:11:08,024 --> 00:11:10,024
What are you doing?

291
00:11:11,024 --> 00:11:12,024
Where is the manager?

292
00:11:12,024 --> 00:11:14,024
He is going to the yard.

293
00:11:14,024 --> 00:11:16,024
He is going to the yard? Can you go in?

294
00:11:16,024 --> 00:11:17,024
He said wait a minute.

295
00:11:17,024 --> 00:11:18,024
Let's go.

296
00:11:18,024 --> 00:11:19,024
Can you go in?

297
00:11:19,024 --> 00:11:20,024
I think I can.

298
00:11:20,024 --> 00:11:22,024
Let's go. The crow is crying.

299
00:11:26,024 --> 00:11:27,024
He is back.

300
00:11:27,024 --> 00:11:28,024
He is not here.

301
00:11:28,024 --> 00:11:30,024
Is this it?

302
00:11:31,226 --> 00:11:37,226
Kobayashi-san who loves dumplings,
wanted to come here.

303
00:11:37,226 --> 00:11:39,226
Kameidomo Dumplings

304
00:11:41,226 --> 00:11:43,226
Here you are.

305
00:11:43,226 --> 00:11:44,634
Thank you.

306
00:11:44,634 --> 00:11:47,634
I haven't ordered yet, but it's already
coming

307
00:11:47,634 --> 00:11:49,634
We only have gyoza

308
00:11:49,634 --> 00:11:52,634
Oh, I see

309
00:11:52,634 --> 00:11:54,634
We have two plates of gyoza

310
00:11:54,634 --> 00:11:56,634
Two plates of gyoza

311
00:11:56,634 --> 00:11:58,634
Wow

312
00:11:58,634 --> 00:12:00,634
Thank you

313
00:12:00,634 --> 00:12:01,634
It's good

314
00:12:01,634 --> 00:12:02,634
We don't have rice

315
00:12:02,634 --> 00:12:04,634
We only have gyoza

316
00:12:04,634 --> 00:12:05,634
That's good

317
00:12:05,634 --> 00:12:08,634
This is really good

318
00:12:08,634 --> 00:12:09,634
It's coming

319
00:12:09,634 --> 00:12:11,634
Let's eat

320
00:12:11,634 --> 00:12:14,634
Thank you

321
00:12:20,432 --> 00:12:22,432
Oh, no!

322
00:12:25,472 --> 00:12:27,472
I've never eaten such a delicious
dumpling

323
00:12:27,472 --> 00:12:28,472
How is it, Yasumoto?

324
00:12:28,472 --> 00:12:29,472
It's delicious

325
00:12:29,472 --> 00:12:32,472
It's the best dumpling I've ever eaten

326
00:12:32,472 --> 00:12:34,472
You just said Kobayashi first

327
00:12:34,472 --> 00:12:35,472
I imitated him

328
00:12:35,472 --> 00:12:37,472
It's delicious

329
00:12:37,472 --> 00:12:38,472
It's amazing

330
00:12:38,472 --> 00:12:41,472
I've never eaten dumplings with mustard

331
00:12:41,472 --> 00:12:43,472
It's soft

332
00:12:43,472 --> 00:12:44,472
It's soft

333
00:12:44,472 --> 00:12:45,472
It's delicious

334
00:12:45,472 --> 00:12:46,472
How about you, Kobayashi?

335
00:12:46,472 --> 00:12:51,472
I had a stomachache when I ate dumplings
the other day

336
00:12:51,472 --> 00:12:53,472
But I can't have this anymore

337
00:12:53,472 --> 00:12:56,472
It's light

338
00:12:56,472 --> 00:12:57,472
It's delicious

339
00:12:57,472 --> 00:12:59,472
I'll be addicted to this

340
00:13:01,472 --> 00:13:02,472
I agree

341
00:13:02,472 --> 00:13:03,472
I want to eat it

342
00:13:03,472 --> 00:13:04,472
I see

343
00:13:04,472 --> 00:13:06,472
It's served right away

344
00:13:07,472 --> 00:13:09,472
It's like a dumpling dumpling

345
00:13:09,472 --> 00:13:10,472
It's a dumpling dumpling

346
00:13:13,472 --> 00:13:15,472
I wanted to see it too

347
00:13:15,472 --> 00:13:16,472
I ate it

348
00:13:16,472 --> 00:13:18,472
It's amazing

349
00:13:19,736 --> 00:13:20,736
Cool

350
00:13:20,736 --> 00:13:22,736
Can you eat two?

351
00:13:23,736 --> 00:13:24,736
Dancing dumpling

352
00:13:26,736 --> 00:13:27,736
Surprised

353
00:13:27,736 --> 00:13:28,736
Delicious

354
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:36,200
Kobayashi-san, how do you feel about the
Kamen-do Gyoza?

355
00:13:36,200 --> 00:13:40,200
I haven't eaten it yet

356
00:13:40,200 --> 00:13:41,200
What do you mean?

357
00:13:41,200 --> 00:13:45,200
I ordered it but it hasn't arrived yet

358
00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:49,200
I'm happy to eat the real thing here

359
00:13:49,200 --> 00:13:52,200
It's been 60 years since it was sold

360
00:13:52,200 --> 00:13:54,200
Thank you

361
00:13:54,200 --> 00:13:56,200
It's delicious

362
00:13:56,200 --> 00:14:01,200
There are sweets inside

363
00:14:02,200 --> 00:14:05,200
As they eat and eat and eat

364
00:14:05,200 --> 00:14:08,200
Group of getting in the car

365
00:14:08,200 --> 00:14:11,200
They walked to the end

366
00:14:11,200 --> 00:14:12,736
See you next time!

367
00:14:13,236 --> 00:14:14,736
I'm full now

368
00:14:14,736 --> 00:14:15,736
I'm hungry

369
00:14:15,736 --> 00:14:20,236
If I ate 3 more dishes, I would have
been out

370
00:14:20,236 --> 00:14:22,736
To be honest, I ate because it was
delicious

371
00:14:22,736 --> 00:14:24,736
But I was full because I ate at Monja

372
00:14:24,736 --> 00:14:25,236
Really?

373
00:14:25,236 --> 00:14:27,236
But I ate because it was delicious

374
00:14:29,736 --> 00:14:31,736
Let's go back

375
00:14:32,736 --> 00:14:34,736
I think it's over there, let's go back

376
00:14:34,736 --> 00:14:35,736
You know it well

377
00:14:35,736 --> 00:14:36,736
I think it's over there

378
00:14:36,736 --> 00:14:38,736
It was fun

379
00:14:38,736 --> 00:14:39,736
Congratulations

380
00:14:40,736 --> 00:14:44,736
After this, the team who doesn't get
drunk on the car started to walk

381
00:14:44,736 --> 00:14:49,736
What kind of shooting is this?

382
00:14:52,520 --> 00:14:54,520
The team that doesn't get drunk on cars

383
00:14:54,520 --> 00:14:57,520
is going to walk around Nishigawa on
Kameido

384
00:14:58,520 --> 00:15:01,520
First, they're going to Kuramae Bridge

385
00:15:01,520 --> 00:15:04,520
lama

386
00:15:05,274 --> 00:15:07,274
Do you go for a walk?

387
00:15:07,274 --> 00:15:09,274
I love to go to Mayama Sanpo

388
00:15:09,274 --> 00:15:11,274
Where do you go for a walk?

389
00:15:11,274 --> 00:15:15,274
On my day off, I go for a walk from
morning to night

390
00:15:15,274 --> 00:15:17,274
A walk?

391
00:15:17,274 --> 00:15:20,274
A walk? Do you go to a shop?

392
00:15:20,274 --> 00:15:22,274
I don't go to a shop

393
00:15:22,274 --> 00:15:28,274
I walk around the park

394
00:15:28,274 --> 00:15:31,274
It's like a boring day of a single
parent

395
00:15:31,274 --> 00:15:38,274
Hoshina-san, a walk leader, found a shop
that interests him

396
00:15:39,604 --> 00:15:40,604
What is this?

397
00:15:40,784 --> 00:15:42,784
Fukuchi Photography Museum. It's
amazing!

398
00:15:42,784 --> 00:15:45,044
It was established in 1920

399
00:15:45,444 --> 00:15:47,444
More than 90 years!

400
00:15:47,444 --> 00:15:48,444
It's amazing!

401
00:15:48,444 --> 00:15:50,444
It's amazing!

402
00:15:52,504 --> 00:15:57,624
This is Fukuchi Photography Museum,
established in 1909

403
00:15:58,544 --> 00:15:59,544
Can I take a photo?

404
00:15:59,544 --> 00:16:01,544
Can you take a photo?

405
00:16:01,544 --> 00:16:02,044
Yes!

406
00:16:02,044 --> 00:16:03,044
Let's take a photo!

407
00:16:03,044 --> 00:16:04,544
It's my first time taking a photo

408
00:16:04,544 --> 00:16:06,544
Let's ask around

409
00:16:06,544 --> 00:16:07,044
Yes!

410
00:16:07,044 --> 00:16:09,044
Let's go in!

411
00:16:09,044 --> 00:16:11,044
Thank you for waiting

412
00:16:13,044 --> 00:16:15,044
Hello!

413
00:16:15,044 --> 00:16:17,044
Hello!

414
00:16:17,044 --> 00:16:21,044
I saw the sign, and it says it was
established in 1920

415
00:16:21,044 --> 00:16:23,044
That's right

416
00:16:23,044 --> 00:16:27,044
My grandfather was in charge of it

417
00:16:27,044 --> 00:16:29,044
I'm the third generation

418
00:16:29,044 --> 00:16:31,044
The third generation!

419
00:16:31,044 --> 00:16:33,044
That's amazing!

420
00:16:33,044 --> 00:16:35,044
Let's take a photo too

421
00:16:35,044 --> 00:16:37,044
It's a rare opportunity

422
00:16:37,044 --> 00:16:39,044
Can I take a photo?

423
00:16:39,044 --> 00:16:41,044
Can I?

424
00:16:41,044 --> 00:16:43,044
Can I?

425
00:16:43,044 --> 00:16:45,044
Yes!

426
00:16:45,044 --> 00:16:53,040
So, the members decided to take a
commemorative photo

427
00:16:53,040 --> 00:16:58,040
Well, everyone's posters are closed, so
it's a little like a photographer.

428
00:16:58,040 --> 00:16:59,040
That's right.

429
00:16:59,040 --> 00:17:00,040
That's good.

430
00:17:00,040 --> 00:17:01,040
It's different.

431
00:17:02,040 --> 00:17:04,040
Founded in 1996

432
00:17:04,040 --> 00:17:10,048
It seems that there is a formation that
the master is particular about.

433
00:17:11,048 --> 00:17:12,048
I'll take this camera.

434
00:17:13,048 --> 00:17:16,048
Let's take a picture together.

435
00:17:17,048 --> 00:17:18,048
Not yet.

436
00:17:19,048 --> 00:17:22,048
Wait a minute.

437
00:17:23,048 --> 00:17:25,048
Smile.

438
00:17:26,048 --> 00:17:28,048
Smile.

439
00:17:29,048 --> 00:17:30,048
Not yet.

440
00:17:31,048 --> 00:17:32,048
Smile.

441
00:17:33,048 --> 00:17:34,048
Smile.

442
00:17:35,048 --> 00:17:37,048
There are various items.

443
00:17:37,048 --> 00:17:38,048
Good.

444
00:17:39,048 --> 00:17:45,048
The master took out the goods of the
popular character to make the members
smile.

445
00:17:46,048 --> 00:17:48,048
This is for babies.

446
00:17:49,048 --> 00:17:50,048
Thank you.

447
00:17:51,048 --> 00:17:52,048
Thank you.

448
00:17:56,048 --> 00:17:57,048
I have to take a picture.

449
00:17:58,048 --> 00:17:59,048
I see.

450
00:18:00,048 --> 00:18:01,048
Thank you.

451
00:18:02,048 --> 00:18:03,048
Thank you.

452
00:18:03,048 --> 00:18:07,048
I'll take a picture.

453
00:18:08,048 --> 00:18:10,048
Smile.

454
00:18:13,048 --> 00:18:15,048
What's your name?

455
00:18:16,048 --> 00:18:17,048
I'm Taki.

456
00:18:18,048 --> 00:18:21,048
Let's shake hands.

457
00:18:22,048 --> 00:18:23,048
Shake hands.

458
00:18:24,048 --> 00:18:26,048
That's good.

459
00:18:27,048 --> 00:18:28,048
Is this good?

460
00:18:28,048 --> 00:18:32,048
I'm looking forward to the finished
product.

461
00:18:33,048 --> 00:18:36,048
How long does it take to take a picture?

462
00:18:37,048 --> 00:18:41,048
It usually takes time, but this time we
made it a big one.

463
00:18:42,048 --> 00:18:44,048
Thank you.

464
00:18:45,048 --> 00:18:50,048
Let's go back to the town.

465
00:18:51,048 --> 00:18:53,048
I'm looking forward to the finished
product.

466
00:18:54,048 --> 00:18:55,048
I'm looking forward to it.

467
00:18:55,048 --> 00:18:55,168
Thank you.

468
00:18:55,168 --> 00:18:56,672
Thank you.

469
00:18:57,672 --> 00:19:00,672
It looks like a shop decoration.

470
00:19:00,672 --> 00:19:02,672
It's amazing.

471
00:19:03,672 --> 00:19:05,672
Let's do this.

472
00:19:05,672 --> 00:19:07,672
What is this?

473
00:19:07,672 --> 00:19:09,672
I heard it suddenly.

474
00:19:09,672 --> 00:19:13,672
From a popular brand, a rare item is
also a treasure.

475
00:19:13,672 --> 00:19:15,672
I want to do a gacha.

476
00:19:15,672 --> 00:19:17,672
It's suspicious.

477
00:19:17,672 --> 00:19:22,672
Hoshina found a 1,000 yen vending
machine.

478
00:19:22,672 --> 00:19:26,672
It seems that a high-class item is a
treasure.

479
00:19:26,672 --> 00:19:29,672
What should we do?

480
00:19:29,672 --> 00:19:32,672
We don't have money.

481
00:19:32,672 --> 00:19:34,672
I don't have money either.

482
00:19:34,672 --> 00:19:36,672
I can't do it.

483
00:19:36,672 --> 00:19:39,672
Which bag did you put your wallet in?

484
00:19:39,672 --> 00:19:43,984
Please subscribe to our channel.

485
00:19:43,984 --> 00:19:45,984
I want to do it.

486
00:19:45,984 --> 00:19:47,984
I really felt bad.

487
00:19:47,984 --> 00:19:49,984
I asked the staff to take the prize.

488
00:19:49,984 --> 00:19:51,984
I felt bad.

489
00:19:51,984 --> 00:19:53,984
I want to do it.

490
00:19:53,984 --> 00:19:55,984
I want to do it.

491
00:19:55,984 --> 00:19:57,984
I want to do it.

492
00:19:57,984 --> 00:19:59,984
I used the money for the first time.

493
00:19:59,984 --> 00:20:01,984
What?

494
00:20:01,984 --> 00:20:03,984
I lost the game.

495
00:20:03,984 --> 00:20:05,984
I remember.

496
00:20:05,984 --> 00:20:07,984
I did not forget.

497
00:20:07,984 --> 00:20:09,984
I do not forget.

498
00:20:09,984 --> 00:20:11,984
Please give me a good prize.

499
00:20:11,984 --> 00:20:13,984
For example,

500
00:20:13,984 --> 00:20:15,984
Camera.

501
00:20:15,984 --> 00:20:17,984
This is a good prize.

502
00:20:17,984 --> 00:20:19,984
3DS.

503
00:20:19,984 --> 00:20:21,984
PS Vita.

504
00:20:21,984 --> 00:20:23,984
I got it.

505
00:20:23,984 --> 00:20:25,984
I can play with this glasses.

506
00:20:25,984 --> 00:20:27,984
I can not do it.

507
00:20:27,984 --> 00:20:33,984
Let's start with Mayama.

508
00:20:34,724 --> 00:20:37,224
It's cheap for 20,000 people wearing a
mask

509
00:20:37,224 --> 00:20:38,224
That's true

510
00:20:38,224 --> 00:20:39,224
It's cheap

511
00:20:39,224 --> 00:20:40,224
Can we do it now?

512
00:20:40,224 --> 00:20:41,224
20 times?

513
00:20:41,224 --> 00:20:44,224
Why do you want to do it for the mask?

514
00:20:47,224 --> 00:20:48,224
It's coming

515
00:20:48,224 --> 00:20:49,224
What is it?

516
00:20:49,224 --> 00:20:50,224
There it is

517
00:20:50,224 --> 00:20:51,224
It's small

518
00:20:51,224 --> 00:20:52,224
It's small

519
00:20:52,224 --> 00:20:54,224
What is it?

520
00:20:54,224 --> 00:20:55,224
It's small

521
00:20:55,224 --> 00:20:57,224
It's small and light

522
00:20:57,224 --> 00:20:58,224
I have a bad feeling about this

523
00:20:59,224 --> 00:21:01,224
Is it a glasses?

524
00:21:01,224 --> 00:21:02,224
No

525
00:21:02,224 --> 00:21:03,224
Is it a light?

526
00:21:03,224 --> 00:21:04,224
I don't know

527
00:21:04,224 --> 00:21:06,224
It could be a luxury watch

528
00:21:06,224 --> 00:21:07,224
Maybe

529
00:21:07,224 --> 00:21:08,224
I can't open it

530
00:21:08,224 --> 00:21:10,224
Let's open it

531
00:21:12,720 --> 00:21:15,720
What?

532
00:21:16,576 --> 00:21:20,176
It's a lighter type cable

533
00:21:20,176 --> 00:21:21,176
What does it mean?

534
00:21:21,176 --> 00:21:23,176
It's a cable for cell phone chargers

535
00:21:23,176 --> 00:21:26,176
It's a cable for iPhone

536
00:21:26,176 --> 00:21:28,176
It's practical

537
00:21:28,176 --> 00:21:29,176
Amazing

538
00:21:29,176 --> 00:21:35,176
Mayama-san chose an item that is hard to
tell if it's a hit or miss

539
00:21:35,176 --> 00:21:36,176
This kind of item

540
00:21:36,176 --> 00:21:38,176
It's a shocker

541
00:21:38,176 --> 00:21:39,176
It's a return item

542
00:21:39,176 --> 00:21:46,176
Matsuno-san and Hoshina-san also got a
t-shirt that is hard to say

543
00:21:47,240 --> 00:21:48,440
Finally Hirota-san

544
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:51,280
Of course the target must be right

545
00:21:54,540 --> 00:21:56,040
You've got a small one

546
00:21:57,520 --> 00:21:58,500
Add-san are the t-shirts written in
green?

547
00:21:58,820 --> 00:22:00,240
How does it feel?

548
00:22:00,240 --> 00:22:02,940
Stylish

549
00:22:02,940 --> 00:22:04,940
It's like plastic.

550
00:22:09,018 --> 00:22:11,018
What did you buy?

551
00:22:11,018 --> 00:22:12,018
Did you win?

552
00:22:12,018 --> 00:22:14,018
It's 1000 yen

553
00:22:14,018 --> 00:22:16,018
What did you buy with 1000 yen?

554
00:22:18,018 --> 00:22:19,018
I won!

555
00:22:19,018 --> 00:22:21,018
I finally won!

556
00:22:22,018 --> 00:22:23,018
Really?

557
00:22:26,018 --> 00:22:27,018
A clock!

558
00:22:27,018 --> 00:22:34,874
What kind of clock?

559
00:22:34,874 --> 00:22:39,874
Well, it's a brand watch that I don't
know well

560
00:22:40,874 --> 00:22:42,874
But it looks good on you

561
00:22:43,874 --> 00:22:45,874
Let's wear it like Honda Seishi

562
00:22:46,874 --> 00:22:48,874
Let's go like Honda Seishi

563
00:22:49,874 --> 00:22:51,874
It's a great fashion point

564
00:22:52,874 --> 00:22:53,874
It's fashionable

565
00:22:54,874 --> 00:22:56,874
It's monotone, so it's fashionable

566
00:22:56,874 --> 00:23:01,104
It's done!

567
00:23:01,104 --> 00:23:03,104
We did it!

568
00:23:03,104 --> 00:23:05,104
I'm glad we got a cool clock

569
00:23:05,104 --> 00:23:07,104
Let's go to the next one!

570
00:23:07,104 --> 00:23:10,104
We wasted 3000 yen and 4000 yen

571
00:23:15,104 --> 00:23:17,104
4000 yen is quite expensive

572
00:23:17,104 --> 00:23:19,104
I know! I know!

573
00:23:21,928 --> 00:23:23,928
Where do you want to go next?

574
00:23:23,928 --> 00:23:26,928
The leader decides!

575
00:23:28,928 --> 00:23:30,928
So we decided!

576
00:23:30,928 --> 00:23:31,928
Yay!

577
00:23:31,928 --> 00:23:32,928
Where is this?

578
00:23:32,928 --> 00:23:34,928
Pet shop!

579
00:23:34,928 --> 00:23:36,928
I want to go!

580
00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:43,240
Next, they go to the pet shop led by a
walk leader

581
00:23:44,240 --> 00:23:47,240
Well, leader, negotiations are over

582
00:23:47,240 --> 00:23:48,240
See you later

583
00:23:48,240 --> 00:23:49,240
Have a good day

584
00:23:49,240 --> 00:23:52,240
Hoshina-san goes to the negotiation

585
00:23:52,240 --> 00:23:57,240
I want to record in the program called
Ebichu Tastos in Fuji, but it's okay

586
00:23:58,240 --> 00:23:59,240
Which one is this?

587
00:23:59,240 --> 00:24:01,240
It's okay if it's just the two of us

588
00:24:01,240 --> 00:24:02,240
Let's be two

589
00:24:02,240 --> 00:24:03,240
Two?

590
00:24:03,240 --> 00:24:05,240
It's not good if there are too many
people

591
00:24:05,240 --> 00:24:06,240
I see

592
00:24:06,240 --> 00:24:07,240
I wonder if they'll be surprised

593
00:24:07,240 --> 00:24:10,240
Let's decide by rock-paper-scissors

594
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:12,240
The two winners are

595
00:24:14,240 --> 00:24:16,240
Hoshina-san and Matsuno-san

596
00:24:16,240 --> 00:24:19,240
They go to the pet shop

597
00:24:19,240 --> 00:24:21,240
See you later

598
00:24:21,240 --> 00:24:25,552
Bye bye!

599
00:24:26,552 --> 00:24:29,552
Next time, the 7th season's special

600
00:24:29,552 --> 00:24:32,552
Ebichu plus Kameido, the final episode

601
00:24:32,552 --> 00:24:34,552
I'm playing with my hair

602
00:24:35,552 --> 00:24:38,552
So cute!

603
00:24:39,552 --> 00:24:42,552
The members are all relaxed

604
00:24:44,552 --> 00:24:47,552
And then, the unexpected guest appears

605
00:24:47,552 --> 00:24:53,552
Kameido Sanpo, the shocking ending

606
00:24:56,250 --> 00:25:01,250
This program was brought to you by the
following sponsors.

607
00:25:10,266 --> 00:25:12,926
請 kidding me?

608
00:25:12,926 --> 00:25:15,506
At least let us use their nostrils.
