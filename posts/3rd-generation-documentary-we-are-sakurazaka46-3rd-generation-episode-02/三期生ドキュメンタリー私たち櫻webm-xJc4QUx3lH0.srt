1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,186
Thank you for watching.

2
00:00:04,186 --> 00:00:08,186
Draw a circle with your well-developed
arm.

3
00:00:08,186 --> 00:00:11,186
Let's draw a circle around the star.

4
00:00:15,186 --> 00:00:18,186
The song I'm going to sing is called
BAN.

5
00:00:18,186 --> 00:00:24,186
BAN is the most difficult dance song in
Sakurazaka 46.

6
00:00:24,186 --> 00:00:33,186
The goal of the 4 nights and 5 days
training camp is to be able to dance the
short version of BAN perfectly.

7
00:00:34,536 --> 00:00:38,536
On the last day of the training camp,
she performs in front of the
choreographer, Takahiro sensei.

8
00:00:39,536 --> 00:00:41,536
Good morning, everyone.

9
00:00:42,536 --> 00:00:44,536
Did you have a good night's sleep last
night?

10
00:00:45,536 --> 00:00:46,536
You did.

11
00:00:47,536 --> 00:00:53,536
I think this training camp requires a
lot of physical strength, so I want you
to eat well and sleep well.

12
00:00:53,536 --> 00:01:01,536
The lessons are divided into 4 teams,
taking into account dance experience.

13
00:01:11,482 --> 00:01:17,482
I'll be doing the short version from the
beginning to the end.

14
00:01:17,482 --> 00:01:23,482
The reason is that Sakurazaka members
learn the whole thing in 3 hours.

15
00:01:23,482 --> 00:01:29,482
Once you're in, it becomes a given, so I
want you to experience it now.

16
00:01:29,482 --> 00:01:31,482
So I'll force you to join.

17
00:01:31,482 --> 00:01:37,482
In Sakurazaka, the time to learn the
choreography, which is called the
choreography of dance, is 3 hours.

18
00:01:37,482 --> 00:01:43,482
Basically, you have to learn all the
choreography there.

19
00:01:57,482 --> 00:02:01,482
The first trial for members who have no
experience in dancing.

20
00:02:01,482 --> 00:02:07,482
I want you to start with this song.

21
00:02:07,482 --> 00:02:10,482
After jumping, put out your left foot.

22
00:02:10,482 --> 00:02:12,482
I'll turn my hand big.

23
00:02:12,482 --> 00:02:23,482
I'm a little impatient to analyze where
I'm not good at and catch up with the
two of them.

24
00:02:23,482 --> 00:02:32,482
I'll do it a little faster.

25
00:02:32,482 --> 00:02:35,504
I'll do it a little faster.

26
00:02:35,504 --> 00:02:38,504
I'm not good at memorizing choreography.

27
00:02:38,504 --> 00:03:01,504
I'm not good at memorizing choreography.

28
00:03:02,202 --> 00:03:06,202
I've been a homebody, so I'm not good at
dancing.

29
00:03:06,202 --> 00:03:11,392
So I'll do my best.

30
00:03:12,392 --> 00:03:13,392
I don't know the moves.

31
00:03:13,392 --> 00:03:15,392
You don't know? Do you want to start
from the beginning?

32
00:03:15,392 --> 00:03:16,392
OK.

33
00:03:16,392 --> 00:03:17,392
Let's do it again.

34
00:03:17,392 --> 00:03:18,392
You're going to do the E.

35
00:03:18,392 --> 00:03:19,392
Ready, go.

36
00:03:21,392 --> 00:03:22,392
You have to do this three times.

37
00:03:22,392 --> 00:03:24,392
One, two, three.

38
00:03:24,392 --> 00:03:25,392
And then you let go.

39
00:03:25,392 --> 00:03:29,392
Your legs are apart at this point, so
you have to close them.

40
00:03:29,392 --> 00:03:31,392
And then your right knee.

41
00:03:31,392 --> 00:03:32,392
Hey!

42
00:03:32,392 --> 00:03:38,392
Let's do it again.

43
00:03:38,392 --> 00:03:40,608
Let's do it again.

44
00:03:41,608 --> 00:03:42,608
I'm behind you.

45
00:03:43,608 --> 00:03:45,608
If you don't understand, come and listen
to me.

46
00:03:45,608 --> 00:03:46,608
I want to do it again.

47
00:03:46,608 --> 00:03:51,608
This lesson time is limited, so you have
to absorb it here.

48
00:04:10,426 --> 00:04:15,322
I draw your fact after the competition
and concentrate on a 정부 VP GM.

49
00:04:15,322 --> 00:04:20,322
I tried to do it in 3 hours, how was it?

50
00:04:20,322 --> 00:04:22,322
It was hard.

51
00:04:22,322 --> 00:04:23,322
It was hard, wasn't it?

52
00:04:23,322 --> 00:04:24,322
It was pretty hard.

53
00:04:24,322 --> 00:04:31,322
The members always do the full length of
the new song in 3 hours to 3 and a half
hours.

54
00:04:31,322 --> 00:04:42,322
For those who have experience in
dancing, the performance of the band is
not easy.

55
00:04:42,714 --> 00:04:47,954
I have noוכay of hanging on to the
train, ever.

56
00:04:49,984 --> 00:05:01,984
I was asked by Akimoto sensei to create
the most difficult dance in the past.

57
00:05:01,984 --> 00:05:04,984
It's difficult.

58
00:05:04,984 --> 00:05:12,984
It's difficult for a child who has no
experience in dancing to do this.

59
00:05:12,984 --> 00:05:20,984
But I think it's more important to keep
up with the dance than to be able to
dance.

60
00:05:20,984 --> 00:05:26,984
If you try to keep up with the dance,
you will be able to dance.

61
00:05:26,984 --> 00:05:38,192
I hope that people will be able to see
that in this training camp.

62
00:05:39,192 --> 00:05:43,192
Do you have a lot of appetite?

63
00:05:43,192 --> 00:05:46,192
Yes.

64
00:05:47,898 --> 00:05:51,898
I'll think about it after I eat
vegetables.

65
00:05:53,898 --> 00:05:55,898
Please wait.

66
00:05:55,898 --> 00:05:57,898
Let's eat.

67
00:05:58,898 --> 00:06:03,898
I understand that she wants to practice
again soon, but taking a break is also
important.

68
00:06:04,898 --> 00:06:06,898
Let's eat.

69
00:06:07,898 --> 00:06:11,898
One, two, three, four.

70
00:06:11,898 --> 00:06:13,898
Open this up.

71
00:06:13,898 --> 00:06:17,898
Riko, you have to peel it off firmly.

72
00:06:20,552 --> 00:06:27,552
I always tell the members to remember
the cool shape of the dance.

73
00:06:30,552 --> 00:06:36,552
Now you can look in the mirror, but when
you get used to it, you'll see the
audience in front of you.

74
00:06:36,552 --> 00:06:48,552
Dance as if you are looking in the
mirror.

75
00:06:53,722 --> 00:06:57,648
Thank you for watching.

76
00:06:57,648 --> 00:06:59,648
Yes.

77
00:06:59,648 --> 00:07:01,648
First, Taniguchi.

78
00:07:01,648 --> 00:07:05,648
You can dance, but your movements are
still small.

79
00:07:05,648 --> 00:07:09,648
You have to dance more dynamically to
stand out on stage.

80
00:07:09,648 --> 00:07:12,648
This hand pose is really important.

81
00:07:12,648 --> 00:07:15,648
If you say this is a Sakura pose,

82
00:07:15,648 --> 00:07:18,648
I hope you never forget this.

83
00:07:18,648 --> 00:07:22,648
I feel like you're not paying attention.

84
00:07:22,648 --> 00:07:26,648
I want you to remember what I told you.

85
00:07:26,648 --> 00:07:30,648
I didn't say this during practice today.

86
00:07:30,648 --> 00:07:32,648
You can see it yourself.

87
00:07:32,648 --> 00:07:34,648
I haven't danced at all.

88
00:07:34,648 --> 00:07:36,648
I'm late alone.

89
00:07:36,648 --> 00:07:38,648
I make mistakes in the same place.

90
00:07:38,648 --> 00:07:40,648
I forget and make mistakes.

91
00:07:40,648 --> 00:07:45,648
If you keep doing that, it's really
dangerous.

92
00:07:45,648 --> 00:07:49,648
You have to be able to dance this intro
properly by tomorrow.

93
00:07:49,648 --> 00:07:52,648
I did the intro part today.

94
00:07:52,648 --> 00:07:54,648
I'll start with 1A tomorrow.

95
00:07:54,648 --> 00:07:58,648
I think you'll get lost as soon as the
song starts.

96
00:07:58,648 --> 00:08:04,648
Today's task is to think about the world
of the song.

97
00:08:04,648 --> 00:08:08,648
And I want you to understand the meaning
of the lyrics.

98
00:08:08,648 --> 00:08:11,648
I want you to take this task and work on
it from tomorrow.

99
00:08:11,648 --> 00:08:14,648
I knew it myself.

100
00:08:14,648 --> 00:08:17,648
I'm the worst dancer in this room.

101
00:08:17,648 --> 00:08:27,648
I'm depending on you two.

102
00:08:27,648 --> 00:08:41,648
I want to do what I said.

103
00:08:43,648 --> 00:08:46,648
Riko said it's my fault.

104
00:08:46,648 --> 00:08:50,648
Riko will check it and remember it.

105
00:08:57,242 --> 00:09:02,242
All I can think about is dancing.

106
00:09:02,242 --> 00:09:05,242
I'm desperate to keep up with the dance.

107
00:09:05,242 --> 00:09:30,042
I can't stop thinking about dancing.

108
00:09:30,042 --> 00:09:36,042
I can't convey the world of music
without singing.

109
00:09:36,042 --> 00:09:39,042
I have to deliver the music.

110
00:09:39,042 --> 00:09:46,800
It's my job to deliver the music.

111
00:09:47,800 --> 00:09:48,800
I decided not to cry.

112
00:09:49,800 --> 00:09:50,800
At the entrance?

113
00:09:51,800 --> 00:09:56,800
I decided not to cry, but I thought I
was carrying it with me.

114
00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:00,800
First of all, are you motivated?

115
00:10:01,800 --> 00:10:02,800
Why can't you remember so much?

116
00:10:03,800 --> 00:10:06,800
To be honest, I've been thinking about
myself all the time.

117
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:16,800
I'm always thinking about myself when
I'm announcing my music in a group.
