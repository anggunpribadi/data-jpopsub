Le Maigro (Luna Naito and Mai Haruna with Yuzuki Oguro) made an emergency visit to Japan to appear on a music program and perform on stage.

This channel exclusively captures the precious backstage talk of the three!
What do they like, what do they feel, and what do they think?

You can't miss every word the three people say!
