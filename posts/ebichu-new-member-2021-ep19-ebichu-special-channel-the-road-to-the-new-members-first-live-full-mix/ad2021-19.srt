1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,786
This was our response to the video.

2
00:00:05,786 --> 00:00:09,986
Ayaka, Hinata, Kaho, Riko, Mirei, Rika

3
00:00:09,986 --> 00:00:12,306
100 times of the original

4
00:00:12,306 --> 00:00:18,306
The first song of the day

5
00:00:18,306 --> 00:00:22,306
The second song of the day

6
00:00:22,306 --> 00:00:26,306
This time, I will show you the secret of
singing during the debut

7
00:00:26,306 --> 00:00:31,306
The secret of singing during the debut

8
00:00:31,306 --> 00:00:33,312
Please look forward to the next.

9
00:00:33,312 --> 00:00:37,312
Let's start the first week of the debut.

10
00:00:38,312 --> 00:00:40,312
What is the lesson for this day?

11
00:00:40,312 --> 00:00:43,312
I explained yesterday.

12
00:00:43,312 --> 00:00:45,312
The part where the voice is made.

13
00:00:45,312 --> 00:00:48,312
There is a part called the biron biron
here.

14
00:00:48,312 --> 00:00:50,312
What was it called?

15
00:00:53,312 --> 00:01:00,312
Voice training by Nishiyama Emiko, who
also participated in the audition
training of the new members.

16
00:01:00,312 --> 00:01:02,312
This is the vocal cords.

17
00:01:02,312 --> 00:01:05,312
When you breathe, you open it like this.

18
00:01:05,312 --> 00:01:10,312
When you exhale, you blow air into the
vocal cords.

19
00:01:10,312 --> 00:01:16,784
So, remember the system that you must
not stick to the vocal cords unless you
blow air.

20
00:01:16,784 --> 00:01:22,784
Ms. Emiko has been in charge of the
singing and dancing of Ebichu since 7
years ago when Kahoriko joined.

21
00:01:23,784 --> 00:01:26,784
Excuse me.

22
00:01:26,784 --> 00:01:27,784
I'm sorry.

23
00:01:28,784 --> 00:01:31,784
She is a very fun and funky lady.

24
00:01:33,784 --> 00:01:36,784
With a method with both theoretical and
scientific background,

25
00:01:36,784 --> 00:01:40,784
she has supported Ebichu's singing from
the shadows.

26
00:01:41,784 --> 00:01:44,784
The tone of the voice, the sound of the
voice.

27
00:01:44,784 --> 00:01:47,784
What kind of voice do you remember?

28
00:01:47,784 --> 00:01:48,784
Real voice.

29
00:01:48,784 --> 00:01:50,784
Yes, real voice.

30
00:01:50,784 --> 00:01:51,784
What is the kanji?

31
00:01:51,784 --> 00:01:52,784
The voice of the green.

32
00:01:52,784 --> 00:01:56,784
Yes, that's right.

33
00:01:56,784 --> 00:01:59,784
The voice with the green in real life.

34
00:02:00,784 --> 00:02:01,784
Ready, go.

35
00:02:02,784 --> 00:02:04,784
For the three new members,

36
00:02:04,784 --> 00:02:07,784
she is carefully guiding them from how
to make the voice.

37
00:02:08,784 --> 00:02:11,784
The relationship between the voice and
the voice.

38
00:02:11,784 --> 00:02:14,784
You just said, huh?

39
00:02:14,784 --> 00:02:16,784
What was the expression for the voice?

40
00:02:16,784 --> 00:02:17,784
H, A.

41
00:02:17,784 --> 00:02:20,784
H, A.

42
00:02:20,784 --> 00:02:22,784
Which is the character of the voice?

43
00:02:22,784 --> 00:02:23,784
H.

44
00:02:23,784 --> 00:02:27,784
What was the role of the voice?

45
00:02:27,784 --> 00:02:31,784
The voice is air.

46
00:02:31,784 --> 00:02:35,784
If you don't make the air, the voice
won't be good.

47
00:02:35,784 --> 00:02:37,784
It won't be real.

48
00:02:37,784 --> 00:02:41,784
Let's practice singing the C.

49
00:02:41,784 --> 00:02:43,784
Let's practice.

50
00:02:43,784 --> 00:02:45,784
Let's practice.

51
00:02:45,784 --> 00:02:46,784
Let's practice.

52
00:02:46,784 --> 00:02:47,784
Let's practice.

53
00:02:47,784 --> 00:02:49,784
Let's practice.

54
00:02:49,784 --> 00:02:51,784
One, two, three, go.

55
00:02:51,784 --> 00:02:52,784
Ready, go.

56
00:02:52,784 --> 00:02:59,784
A, ya, hi, na, ka, ho, ri, ko, ri, re,
ri, ka.

57
00:02:59,784 --> 00:03:00,784
Do you understand?

58
00:03:00,784 --> 00:03:04,784
Without the C, the words won't be
connected.

59
00:03:04,784 --> 00:03:07,712
A, ya, hi, na, ka, ho, ri, ka.

60
00:03:07,712 --> 00:03:09,712
Ri, ko, mi, re, i, ri, ka.

61
00:03:09,712 --> 00:03:11,712
100 times faster.

62
00:03:11,712 --> 00:03:13,712
1, 2, 3, 4.

63
00:03:13,712 --> 00:03:17,712
A, ya, ka, hi, na, ka, ho, ri, ko, mi,
re, i, ri, ka.

64
00:03:17,712 --> 00:03:19,712
One more time.

65
00:03:19,712 --> 00:03:21,712
Looking at the island.

66
00:03:21,712 --> 00:03:22,712
1, 2, 3.

67
00:03:22,712 --> 00:03:33,472
A, ya, ka, hi, na, ka, ho, ri, ko, mi,
re, i, ri, ka.

68
00:03:33,472 --> 00:03:37,472
To make a voice, they move their bodies.

69
00:03:37,472 --> 00:03:39,472
Everyone, let's have fun!

70
00:03:39,472 --> 00:03:41,472
Let's go!

71
00:03:41,472 --> 00:03:43,472
Let's go!

72
00:03:43,472 --> 00:03:45,472
Let's go!

73
00:03:45,472 --> 00:03:47,472
Let's go!

74
00:03:47,472 --> 00:03:49,472
Let's go!

75
00:03:49,472 --> 00:03:53,306
Aya, ka, bisante! Bye!

76
00:03:53,306 --> 00:03:56,306
This is the end of the warm-up.

77
00:03:56,306 --> 00:04:13,346
After the warm-up, they check the

78
00:04:13,346 --> 00:04:24,346
iper andelyantysport show.

79
00:04:24,858 --> 00:04:33,858
And then, yesterday, we talked about
making a face, but our faces are
different.

80
00:04:33,858 --> 00:04:36,858
No, not our faces. Our mouths are small,
so we can't look like we're singing.

81
00:04:36,858 --> 00:04:38,858
We have to open our mouths more, so we
can't look like we're singing.

82
00:04:40,858 --> 00:04:42,858
Of course, the singing voice is
important.

83
00:04:42,858 --> 00:04:44,858
In the debut, they are an idol group.

84
00:04:44,858 --> 00:04:51,546
They have to be aware of how they look
on stage.

85
00:04:52,386 --> 00:04:53,386
And then...

86
00:04:53,386 --> 00:04:55,386
That's right

87
00:04:55,386 --> 00:04:57,386
That's right

88
00:04:57,386 --> 00:04:59,386
That's right

89
00:04:59,386 --> 00:05:01,386
You're too bright

90
00:05:01,386 --> 00:05:03,386
You're too bright

91
00:05:03,386 --> 00:05:05,386
What are you looking at, Yuno?

92
00:05:05,386 --> 00:05:07,386
You're not looking there

93
00:05:07,386 --> 00:05:09,386
You're looking here

94
00:05:09,386 --> 00:05:11,386
You're looking here

95
00:05:11,386 --> 00:05:13,386
When Yuno sings,

96
00:05:13,386 --> 00:05:18,000
Am casting that prelude, we notice
calling him 가냥 나

97
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:44,000
Majura Yeseba, absolutely editor

98
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
Thank you for watching.

99
00:05:52,250 --> 00:05:54,250
Thank you for your hard work

100
00:05:54,250 --> 00:05:57,250
Nono, please bring the mic

101
00:05:59,250 --> 00:06:01,250
During the audition training camp

102
00:06:02,250 --> 00:06:04,250
Nono's voice is amazing

103
00:06:04,250 --> 00:06:06,250
She can sing

104
00:06:06,250 --> 00:06:13,984
Nono's senior member praised her singing
voice

105
00:06:13,984 --> 00:06:18,984
She struggled a little here

106
00:06:18,984 --> 00:06:25,984
I don't want to reveal the true nature
of everyone

107
00:06:25,984 --> 00:06:28,984
But everyone

108
00:06:28,984 --> 00:06:31,984
I'm not doing this with the microphone

109
00:06:31,984 --> 00:06:33,984
I think I have to bring the microphone
here

110
00:06:33,984 --> 00:06:36,984
1,2,3,4

111
00:06:36,984 --> 00:06:41,984
But everyone is really

112
00:06:41,984 --> 00:06:42,490
I'm not doing this with the microphone

113
00:06:42,490 --> 00:06:44,490
Let's do it a little bit more.

114
00:06:51,290 --> 00:06:53,290
I'll do it completely.

115
00:06:53,290 --> 00:06:55,790
I'll put everything on my feet.

116
00:06:58,290 --> 00:07:00,290
She can sing beautifully,

117
00:07:00,290 --> 00:07:02,290
but she doesn't have the desire to do
so.

118
00:07:02,290 --> 00:07:04,290
She's not good enough to show her
accent.

119
00:07:05,290 --> 00:07:07,290
I'll do it again.

120
00:07:12,290 --> 00:07:14,290
I'll do it like this.

121
00:07:14,290 --> 00:07:22,290
I'll do it like this.

122
00:07:22,290 --> 00:07:24,122
Thank you.

123
00:07:24,122 --> 00:07:26,122
And

124
00:07:26,122 --> 00:07:32,122
I heard that there is a singing test, so
I don't sing

125
00:07:32,122 --> 00:07:42,896
I was talking about the fact that I was
not good at singing at the camp.

126
00:07:44,896 --> 00:07:45,896
そうだね。で、こう。

127
00:07:49,896 --> 00:07:50,896
そうで、もっと。で、こう。

128
00:07:52,896 --> 00:07:53,896
とか、いい。もっと歌ってみよう。

129
00:07:57,896 --> 00:07:58,896
それぐらい。

130
00:07:58,896 --> 00:08:02,896
ケイのシーンが出ると、めっちゃ歌ってエモーションに聞こえてくるのね。

131
00:08:02,896 --> 00:08:03,896
から、

132
00:08:04,896 --> 00:08:06,896
特に、木とかめっちゃ出してるし、

133
00:08:06,896 --> 00:08:10,896
地下付きたいよりも。

134
00:08:10,896 --> 00:08:13,896
地下付きたいってなると、なんか大人っぽい歌い方になるっていうか、アーティスティッ
クで歌えるようになるから、

135
00:08:15,896 --> 00:08:17,896
地下付きたいよりも。

136
00:08:17,896 --> 00:08:18,896
つかづきたいぐらい。めっちゃ新出した。

137
00:08:23,896 --> 00:08:24,896
それぐらい。

138
00:08:24,896 --> 00:08:25,896
こうでさ、この

139
00:08:26,896 --> 00:08:30,896
ここで歌い終わるまでずっと顔をつくって、ずっと顔を残していて。

140
00:08:30,896 --> 00:08:32,896
I want to get closer to you

141
00:08:32,896 --> 00:08:34,896
That's right, like this

142
00:08:34,896 --> 00:08:36,896
I want to get closer to you

143
00:08:36,896 --> 00:08:38,896
That's about right

144
00:08:38,896 --> 00:08:40,896
I'll start from the middle of the first
line

145
00:08:40,896 --> 00:08:44,896
The teachers are conscious of the parts
they pointed out and once again

146
00:08:44,896 --> 00:08:50,896
The first line is the most beautiful

147
00:08:50,896 --> 00:08:52,896
Please teach me

148
00:08:52,896 --> 00:08:57,594
I want to get closer to you

149
00:09:24,026 --> 00:09:26,026
That's right. You can leave it like
that.

150
00:09:26,026 --> 00:09:28,026
You can leave it completely.

151
00:09:28,026 --> 00:09:29,026
Leave it like that.

152
00:09:29,026 --> 00:09:31,026
Then, you can make a loud voice.

153
00:09:31,026 --> 00:09:33,026
That's good.

154
00:09:34,026 --> 00:09:37,026
As they continue their lessons,

155
00:09:37,026 --> 00:09:48,026
they are able to see the challenges of
the three of them for their first live
performance.

156
00:09:48,442 --> 00:09:50,502
Okay, now set your stage.

157
00:09:50,502 --> 00:09:50,222
Have a set of officer's

158
00:09:50,182 --> 00:09:55,162
Okay, now set your stage.

159
00:09:55,162 --> 00:09:55,302
Have a set of officer's

160
00:09:55,302 --> 00:09:55,142
Then add to all your practice.

161
00:09:55,142 --> 00:09:56,822
Then add to all your practice.

162
00:09:56,822 --> 00:09:57,342
Make S feature the whole song.

163
00:09:57,342 --> 00:09:59,422
Then add to all your practice.

164
00:09:59,422 --> 00:09:59,462
Make a set of officer's

165
00:09:59,362 --> 00:10:00,622
Then add to all your practice.

166
00:10:00,622 --> 00:09:57,822
So, you know something will happen.

167
00:10:00,622 --> 00:10:02,922
Make a S feature bottle-like one.

168
00:10:04,922 --> 00:10:07,022
You can't change the eye looks.

169
00:10:07,022 --> 00:10:11,262
Otherwise, you can't be famous with your
songs.

170
00:10:11,262 --> 00:10:13,362
You will get nervous,

171
00:10:13,362 --> 00:10:15,202
and you'll never change because of eye
looks.

172
00:10:15,202 --> 00:10:17,662
You can practice and work.

173
00:10:17,662 --> 00:10:20,842
You can lift this part a little more

174
00:10:20,842 --> 00:10:23,902
If you don't lift this part, the back of
your mouth won't open

175
00:10:23,902 --> 00:10:28,922
Because your voice is here, it will
become a cute voice

176
00:10:28,922 --> 00:10:31,262
So practice opening your mouth wide

177
00:10:31,262 --> 00:10:33,262
That's what you should do at home

178
00:10:33,762 --> 00:10:35,042
Thank you for your help

179
00:10:35,042 --> 00:10:37,042
After the lesson, the three of them

180
00:10:38,142 --> 00:10:39,142
I can't see

181
00:10:40,082 --> 00:10:43,002
I don't know where I'm looking at

182
00:10:43,002 --> 00:10:44,082
I'm nervous

183
00:10:45,462 --> 00:10:46,962
It's difficult

184
00:10:46,962 --> 00:10:49,942
I can't sing well

185
00:10:49,942 --> 00:10:52,882
T, K and S

186
00:10:52,882 --> 00:10:56,582
I can't sing well

187
00:10:56,582 --> 00:10:57,582
I'll do my best

188
00:10:58,582 --> 00:11:02,002
Kokona, who pointed out the way of
singing like a child

189
00:11:02,002 --> 00:11:05,462
I was a baby

190
00:11:05,462 --> 00:11:06,962
I can't stand up

191
00:11:06,962 --> 00:11:08,962
I can't do the same thing as a cat

192
00:11:08,962 --> 00:11:12,032
It's difficult to do it like this

193
00:11:12,032 --> 00:11:19,032
I want to raise the number of songs that
are called by Ms. Emiko Masa and sing it
like an adult

194
00:11:21,032 --> 00:11:25,032
Next time, continuing the lesson every
day like this

195
00:11:27,032 --> 00:11:32,032
I want to seduce you

196
00:11:33,032 --> 00:11:36,032
First time to infiltrate the recording
studio

197
00:11:36,032 --> 00:11:39,032
Next time, I will do it like this

198
00:11:40,032 --> 00:11:42,032
I want to seduce you

199
00:11:42,032 --> 00:11:47,061
Next time, I will do it like this
