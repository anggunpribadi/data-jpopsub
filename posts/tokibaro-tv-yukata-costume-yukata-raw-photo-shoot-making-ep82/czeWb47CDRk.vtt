00:56.656 --> 00:58.656
 We're shooting a commercial.

00:58.656 --> 01:01.656
 I've become loose again.

01:03.736 --> 01:11.736
 Who is the cutest in the world?

01:13.736 --> 01:15.736
 I know, I know.

01:25.048 --> 01:27.048
 I'm going to start with the members.

01:27.048 --> 01:28.048
 I'm nervous.

01:28.048 --> 01:30.048
 I'm using my brain a lot.

01:30.048 --> 01:32.048
 You're using your brain a lot.

01:34.048 --> 01:36.048
 I'm going to speak more clearly.

01:39.048 --> 01:40.048
 I'm going to start.

01:45.048 --> 01:47.048
 Peace! Peace!

01:49.048 --> 01:50.048
 I'm going to start.

01:50.048 --> 01:51.048
 I'm going to start.

01:51.048 --> 01:52.048
 Great!

01:53.376 --> 01:55.376
 So, the answer is...

01:55.376 --> 01:56.376
 Leo!

01:56.376 --> 01:58.376
 Bye-bye!

01:58.376 --> 02:00.376
 Thank you!

02:00.376 --> 02:02.376
 Bye-bye!

02:04.186 --> 02:06.186
 Cute!

02:10.416 --> 02:12.416
 Oh, so cute!

02:12.416 --> 02:14.416
 So cute!

02:14.416 --> 02:16.416
 Cute!

02:16.416 --> 02:20.416
 I got my hair done by a hair stylist.

02:20.416 --> 02:25.416
 I'm going to show my hair style this
time.

02:30.416 --> 02:32.416
 The hair style is so cute.

02:32.416 --> 02:37.416
 I'm going to show you my high-heeled
shoes.

02:38.648 --> 02:40.648
 I'm going to be on the stage.

02:44.648 --> 02:48.648
 We took the first picture together.

02:49.648 --> 02:51.648
 I'm wearing high heels.

02:52.648 --> 02:53.648
 You look cute.

02:53.648 --> 03:03.648
 Thank you for watching my video.

03:03.898 --> 03:05.898
 I'm a fan of you.

03:06.898 --> 03:08.898
 I'm taking a picture of you.

03:10.898 --> 03:11.898
 Thank you.

03:11.898 --> 03:12.898
 Thank you.

03:12.898 --> 03:26.898
 I'm cute, aren't I?

03:27.054 --> 03:31.314
 Too of

03:31.314 --> 03:33.534
 me

03:33.534 --> 03:35.534
 Thank you.

03:35.534 --> 03:37.534
 Thank you.

03:37.534 --> 03:39.534
 The spring is coming.

03:39.534 --> 03:41.534
 The spring is coming.

03:44.152 --> 03:45.152
 It's so cute. It's summer.

03:46.152 --> 03:48.152
 I feel like summer has started.

03:52.152 --> 03:56.152
 How is your summer?

03:56.152 --> 04:22.152
 Please subscribe to this channel!

04:37.402 --> 04:40.082
 Let's go! Tumor, Tumor, Tumorou!

04:40.082 --> 04:41.162
 The strongest!

04:41.162 --> 04:43.842
 Hello, hello to the new me!

04:43.842 --> 04:46.682
 I don't care what they say!

04:46.682 --> 04:49.562
 I'll just go all out!

04:49.562 --> 04:50.882
 Tumor, Tumor, Tumorou!

04:50.882 --> 04:51.882
 The strongest!

04:51.882 --> 05:04.080
 Hello to the infinite possibilities!

05:05.080 --> 05:12.080
 We are Super Arena's center, and we are
Super Doki Doki Mix!

05:12.080 --> 05:13.080
 Until...

05:14.080 --> 05:16.080
 the 4th day!

05:16.080 --> 05:17.018
 What?

05:17.018 --> 05:19.018
 It's only 4 days left!

05:19.018 --> 05:21.018
 It's almost time.

05:21.018 --> 05:28.018
 I'm so happy to be able to perform at
the Super Arena for the first time.

05:28.018 --> 05:34.018
 I've always wanted to be on this stage.

05:34.018 --> 05:37.018
 I've always wanted to come back and
perform live.

05:37.018 --> 05:39.018
 I'm really looking forward to it.

05:39.018 --> 05:43.648
 I'm so happy to be able to perform with
my team this time.

05:44.648 --> 05:52.648
 We will show you various stages and
various angles.

05:52.648 --> 06:04.648
 We will do our best to show you the
very advanced Tokimeki Senrenbu from the
last live show.

06:04.648 --> 06:06.648
 Please look forward to it.

06:06.648 --> 06:12.560
 Bye bye!

06:12.560 --> 06:14.560
 Alright!

06:14.560 --> 06:17.560
 From the Super Rhythm Center in
Saitama,

06:17.560 --> 06:20.560
 to our super exclusive promotion,

06:20.560 --> 06:23.560
 there's only 4 days left!

06:23.560 --> 06:25.560
 Thank you!

06:25.664 --> 06:37.664
 We are so excited to be able to deliver
a live performance from a dreamlike
venue called Saitama Super Arena.

06:37.664 --> 06:40.664
 We are also working on rehearsals.

06:40.664 --> 06:47.664
 There are parts that are cute and parts
that are cool.

06:47.664 --> 06:56.664
 It's a really exciting content, so I
think you'll be able to see it.

06:56.664 --> 07:02.032
 And there is also a new prize!

07:03.032 --> 07:08.032
 This new prize is a bit of a surprise,

07:08.032 --> 07:13.032
 and it's also a way to show our love to
you through the costumes.

07:13.032 --> 07:16.032
 So please look forward to it!

07:16.032 --> 07:21.032
 Then, let's watch the 4th day video!

07:21.032 --> 07:22.032
 Let's go!

07:22.032 --> 07:23.032
 One, two, three!

07:23.032 --> 07:24.032
 Ta-da!

07:24.032 --> 07:25.032
 Oh?

07:25.032 --> 07:26.704
 I can't remember the name of the song!

07:27.704 --> 07:29.704
 I'll try again!

07:31.704 --> 07:33.704
 I'm here!

07:33.704 --> 07:36.704
 I have 6 more shows today!

07:36.704 --> 07:38.704
 I'm so excited!

07:39.704 --> 07:44.704
 I'm going to perform at SSA this time.

07:44.704 --> 07:51.704
 I'm going to make the biggest stage of
the show a reality.

07:51.704 --> 08:00.704
 I'm going to do a live broadcast, but
I'm going to do a lot of things that you
can enjoy.

08:00.704 --> 08:03.704
 Please look forward to it!

08:03.704 --> 08:10.704
 SSA is the best!

08:10.704 --> 08:13.704
 S is the best!

08:13.704 --> 08:15.704
 And A is...

08:15.704 --> 08:17.402
 See you next time!

08:17.402 --> 08:27.402
 I will deliver the strongest and best
live of love to everyone.

08:27.402 --> 08:31.402
 So everyone, please wait 4 days later.

08:31.402 --> 08:34.402
 SSS

08:34.402 --> 08:35.402
 I will go.

08:35.402 --> 08:37.402
 Transform

08:39.402 --> 08:46.402
 Yes, in 4 days, I will have a live
broadcast from Saitama Super Arena.

08:46.402 --> 08:48.402
 Yes, this live is

08:48.402 --> 08:54.402
 I'm glad I couldn't do a live at
Tachikawa Tachihi Arena.

08:54.402 --> 08:59.402
 Tanamin and Haru made a super craft in
advance.

08:59.402 --> 09:01.402
 I made it.

09:01.402 --> 09:02.402
 There is also a circle of that.

09:02.402 --> 09:08.402
 This time, I will have a live broadcast
of the director of the live from Saitama
Super Arena.

09:08.402 --> 09:14.402
 It's a venue where memories are really
packed in Saitama Super Arena.

09:14.402 --> 09:19.402
 I've had so many times when I thought I
wanted to stand again.

09:19.402 --> 09:22.402
 This time, such a dream was fulfilled.

09:22.402 --> 09:25.402
 It's a form of audienceless.

09:25.402 --> 09:31.402
 I'm very happy to be able to play in
Saitama Super Arena alone.

09:31.402 --> 09:33.402
 Thank you very much.

09:33.402 --> 09:38.402
 On that day, I'm getting a lot of
support from fans.

09:38.402 --> 09:41.402
 I'm still getting a lot of support.

09:41.402 --> 09:45.402
 I'm going to deliver my gratitude to a
lot of people.

09:45.402 --> 09:48.402
 I think I can continue to go beyond the
radio wave.

09:48.402 --> 09:53.402
 I will do my best, so please look
forward to it.

09:53.402 --> 09:58.384
 See you soon!

09:59.384 --> 10:11.384
 We are going to have our first Arena
One Man Live on August 23rd at the Super
Arena Center in Saitama.

10:12.384 --> 10:18.384
 I'm a bit disappointed that we can't
meet Senri-san at this time of year.

10:19.384 --> 10:21.384
 But we can do it through the
transmission.

10:22.384 --> 10:25.384
 For example, you can see Senri-san
here.

10:25.384 --> 10:27.384
 I want to go there.

10:28.384 --> 10:34.384
 We will deliver a lot of excitement to
everyone beyond the transmission.

10:35.384 --> 10:49.384
 We will deliver a very energetic and
powerful live performance that will make
you feel more excited than the first
live of the Z-Hundreds.

10:50.384 --> 10:51.384
 Please look forward to it.

10:51.384 --> 10:56.384
 And, and, and, we will have a new song
and a new award.

10:57.384 --> 11:03.384
 It's the first time we're performing on
a 360-degree stage.

11:04.384 --> 11:08.384
 It's the first time we're doing
something new.

11:09.384 --> 11:10.384
 Please look forward to it.

11:11.384 --> 11:15.384
 I can't say the details, but please
support Julia!

11:15.384 --> 11:21.384
 Please look forward to the Arena One
Man Live.

11:23.680 --> 11:25.080
 Perfectionism.

11:25.680 --> 11:27.680
 I'm so excited!

11:27.680 --> 11:31.680
 I'm so excited to meet you, Celia-chan!

11:31.680 --> 11:35.680
 On August 23rd, I'll be performing at
the Super Arena in Kyoto.

11:35.680 --> 11:41.680
 I'll be performing my first live
performance!

11:41.680 --> 11:43.680
 That's what I'll be doing!

11:43.680 --> 11:48.680
 I'll be doing a live stream.

11:48.680 --> 11:59.680
 I'll be doing a live stream, and you
can watch my performance!

11:59.680 --> 12:03.984
 I'll be doing a live stream!

12:04.984 --> 12:15.984
 I can't say that I'll be able to see
all of you from the new song, but I'll
be doing my best, so I hope you'll like
it!

12:16.984 --> 12:20.984
 The last one is Super Arena SSA!

12:20.984 --> 12:23.984
 I'm Aki Suda! The strongest Aki Suda!

12:23.984 --> 12:26.984
 SSA! SSA! I'll do my best!

12:26.984 --> 12:30.400
 I'll be waiting for you!

12:31.400 --> 12:34.400
 I still have a lot of fun memories

12:34.400 --> 12:37.400
 Shining in the sky

12:37.400 --> 12:43.400
 I tried to stretch my hands as much as
I could

12:44.400 --> 12:47.400
 I tried my best, but

12:47.400 --> 12:50.400
 I'm sure I can't reach you anymore

12:50.400 --> 12:52.400
 I love you

12:52.400 --> 12:55.400
 I miss you

12:55.400 --> 12:58.400
 Every time I think of you like this

12:58.400 --> 13:02.400
 The back of my chest is tight

13:02.400 --> 13:06.400
 A rainbow-colored bench

13:06.400 --> 13:10.400
 I'm still waiting

13:10.400 --> 13:12.400
 A white bench

13:12.400 --> 13:14.400
 A distorted view

13:14.400 --> 13:21.400
 I'm still waiting for someone

13:32.506 --> 13:39.506
 You're not coming back here anymore,
are you?

13:48.314 --> 13:53.314
 I love you

13:53.314 --> 13:56.314
 Hey, I'll never forget

13:56.314 --> 13:59.314
 Under the sky where we met

13:59.314 --> 14:04.314
 I love you

14:04.816 --> 14:07.616
 I'm happy just being like this

14:07.616 --> 14:11.216
 This kind of time is happiness

14:11.216 --> 14:15.136
 A rainbow-colored bench

14:15.136 --> 14:19.136
 Will never change

14:30.202 --> 14:40.702
 Benji! One, two, three, four, five!

14:45.658 --> 14:52.658
 Thank you for watching!
