00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
Thank you for watching.

2
00:00:32,858 --> 00:00:34,858
Hello?

3
00:00:35,858 --> 00:00:37,858
Hello?

4
00:00:38,858 --> 00:00:40,858
Hello?

5
00:00:41,858 --> 00:00:43,858
Hello?

6
00:00:43,858 --> 00:00:45,858
Haruka?

7
00:00:45,858 --> 00:00:47,858
Hello?

8
00:00:47,858 --> 00:00:49,858
Haruka, it's been a while.

9
00:00:49,858 --> 00:00:51,858
Eh?

10
00:00:51,858 --> 00:00:53,858
Mio-tan?

11
00:00:53,858 --> 00:00:55,858
Wait, wait.

12
00:00:55,858 --> 00:00:57,858
Wait, wait.

13
00:00:57,858 --> 00:01:01,344
Oh my goodness!

14
00:01:01,344 --> 00:01:03,344
Haruka, how are you?

15
00:01:05,344 --> 00:01:07,344
Wait, wait, wait!

16
00:01:10,344 --> 00:01:12,344
Haruka, how are you?

17
00:01:12,344 --> 00:01:15,482
Hello?

18
00:01:15,482 --> 00:01:17,482
Hello?

19
00:01:17,482 --> 00:01:20,482
Hey, your voice is changing, right?

20
00:01:20,482 --> 00:01:22,482
Haruka?

21
00:01:22,482 --> 00:01:25,482
Who is it?

22
00:01:29,482 --> 00:01:31,482
Who is it?

23
00:01:33,482 --> 00:01:36,482
It's Fukuharu Haruka, right?

24
00:01:36,482 --> 00:01:41,904
Eh? Didn't you see it?

25
00:01:41,904 --> 00:01:43,904
You saw it, didn't you?

26
00:01:43,904 --> 00:01:45,904
You saw it!

27
00:01:47,904 --> 00:01:51,904
I tried hard to not notice it, but it
was completely useless.

28
00:01:55,904 --> 00:01:57,904
You saw it, didn't you?

29
00:01:57,904 --> 00:01:59,904
I saw it.

30
00:02:01,904 --> 00:02:03,904
Yaho Harupyon.

31
00:02:03,904 --> 00:02:06,768
Yaho, I always call you Harupyon.

32
00:02:06,768 --> 00:02:09,768
Harupyon? Yeah.

33
00:02:09,768 --> 00:02:14,768
When I say Harupyon, you'll definitely
understand.

34
00:02:14,768 --> 00:02:22,768
I've never called you Haruka before, but
I didn't call you Haruka at all.

35
00:02:22,768 --> 00:02:24,768
I didn't call you at all. I knew it by
your voice.

36
00:02:24,768 --> 00:02:29,768
I didn't call you at all. I thought you
sounded like Miyata from the beginning.

37
00:02:29,768 --> 00:02:33,768
It's kind of... It's kind of...

38
00:02:33,768 --> 00:02:35,856
It's kind of mysterious.

39
00:02:35,856 --> 00:02:38,856
Really? Thank you.

40
00:02:38,856 --> 00:02:42,856
I'm so happy.

41
00:02:42,856 --> 00:02:47,856
Recently, because of the coronavirus,

42
00:02:47,856 --> 00:02:51,856
until then, if I had time,

43
00:02:51,856 --> 00:02:56,856
I would meet her three times a week.

44
00:02:56,856 --> 00:03:00,856
I couldn't meet her directly.

45
00:03:00,856 --> 00:03:05,664
I did contact her, but...

46
00:03:05,664 --> 00:03:11,064
We didn't have much time to talk about
our time together, so...

47
00:03:11,064 --> 00:03:13,064
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

48
00:03:13,064 --> 00:03:18,544
I thought it would be nice if we could
talk about it today.

49
00:03:18,544 --> 00:03:21,264
Hahaha!

50
00:03:21,264 --> 00:03:23,824
I'm so happy! Let's talk!

51
00:03:23,824 --> 00:03:25,824
Thank you!

52
00:03:25,824 --> 00:03:28,992
kissed...

53
00:03:28,992 --> 00:03:34,752
I have a lot of friends, and it's a very
welcoming house.

54
00:03:34,752 --> 00:03:38,272
Harupyo came to visit me a few times.

55
00:03:38,272 --> 00:03:43,712
I really look back at the photos of
yesterday and the time when he came.

56
00:03:43,712 --> 00:03:46,352
It's a birthday cake, isn't it?

57
00:03:46,352 --> 00:03:50,512
I look back at the photos of that time.

58
00:03:50,512 --> 00:03:56,512
I thought it was nostalgic.

59
00:03:56,512 --> 00:03:58,832
I miss you.

60
00:03:58,896 --> 00:04:00,896
Yeah. Yeah.

61
00:04:00,896 --> 00:04:02,896
Because...

62
00:04:02,896 --> 00:04:04,896
How old are you? 17?

63
00:04:04,896 --> 00:04:06,896
Yeah, Harupyon is 17 years old.

64
00:04:06,896 --> 00:04:08,896
I'm 16.

65
00:04:08,896 --> 00:04:09,896
You're 16?

66
00:04:09,896 --> 00:04:11,896
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

67
00:04:11,896 --> 00:04:13,896
How many years?

68
00:04:13,896 --> 00:04:14,896
Yeah.

69
00:04:14,896 --> 00:04:16,896
Six years?

70
00:04:16,896 --> 00:04:17,896
Yeah.

71
00:04:17,896 --> 00:04:20,896
But when you say six years,

72
00:04:20,896 --> 00:04:23,896
it feels like it's only been six years.

73
00:04:23,896 --> 00:04:26,544
Yeah.

74
00:04:26,544 --> 00:04:33,824
But it's been about seven and a half
years since I made my debut.

75
00:04:33,824 --> 00:04:42,584
When I think about it, I think I met
Harupyon as soon as I made my debut.

76
00:04:42,584 --> 00:04:47,744
Harupyon has been doing it since I was
little.

77
00:04:47,744 --> 00:04:50,544
So it was so umm…

78
00:04:50,544 --> 00:04:55,884
I was watching it on Harupyon TV.

79
00:04:55,884 --> 00:04:59,664
So when we first met,

80
00:04:59,664 --> 00:05:01,584
it was like…

81
00:05:01,584 --> 00:05:04,584
It was like…

82
00:05:04,584 --> 00:05:11,964
I didn't think I'd be friends with you.

83
00:05:11,964 --> 00:05:14,384
It was like…

84
00:05:14,384 --> 00:05:18,576
It was like…

85
00:05:18,576 --> 00:05:20,576
I met him.

86
00:05:20,576 --> 00:05:21,576
Really?

87
00:05:21,576 --> 00:05:24,576
But we got along really well.

88
00:05:26,576 --> 00:05:27,576
Right?

89
00:05:27,576 --> 00:05:28,576
Right?

90
00:05:28,576 --> 00:05:30,576
It's strange.

91
00:05:30,576 --> 00:05:32,576
It's strange.

92
00:05:34,576 --> 00:05:35,576
Right?

93
00:05:35,576 --> 00:05:37,576
Yeah.

94
00:05:39,576 --> 00:05:45,576
I feel like we can continue to be
connected in the future.

95
00:05:45,576 --> 00:05:47,808
Right?

96
00:05:49,808 --> 00:05:54,808
何か変な感じするよね。 私さ、多分さ、

97
00:05:55,808 --> 00:06:02,808
一番ミュータンが友達で電話っていう、 電話する?

98
00:06:03,808 --> 00:06:07,808
ミュータンが一番多い気がして。

99
00:06:07,808 --> 00:06:09,808
あ、本当?

100
00:06:10,808 --> 00:06:11,808
そうだね。

101
00:06:11,808 --> 00:06:14,832
私も一番多い気がするんだけど、 私も一番多い気がするんだけど、

102
00:06:14,832 --> 00:06:18,872
I don't even know how to ask you out.

103
00:06:18,872 --> 00:06:21,392
How long have you been out?

104
00:06:21,392 --> 00:06:29,312
Well, the other day, I met you at the
dance show.

105
00:06:29,312 --> 00:06:37,792
I really thought it would be the first
time in a year if I was really bad at
it.

106
00:06:37,792 --> 00:06:39,872
You didn't get along with me?

107
00:06:39,872 --> 00:06:41,552
Yeah.

108
00:06:41,552 --> 00:06:43,344
So sorry, it's almost the 3rd episode.

109
00:06:43,344 --> 00:06:45,344
I think so.

110
00:06:45,344 --> 00:06:47,344
Oh.

111
00:06:47,344 --> 00:06:49,344
Right?

112
00:06:49,344 --> 00:06:51,344
It's not quite right.

113
00:06:51,344 --> 00:06:53,344
That's right.

114
00:06:53,344 --> 00:06:55,344
It's like...

115
00:06:55,344 --> 00:06:57,344
Oh, but that's right.

116
00:06:57,344 --> 00:06:59,344
Haruto came to my location in the
afternoon.

117
00:06:59,344 --> 00:07:01,344
Yes, yes, yes.

118
00:07:01,344 --> 00:07:03,344
He came to work and traveled with me to
Tokyo.

119
00:07:03,344 --> 00:07:05,344
At that time,

120
00:07:05,344 --> 00:07:07,344
I was...

121
00:07:07,344 --> 00:07:09,344
I was...

122
00:07:09,344 --> 00:07:11,376
I was really...

123
00:07:11,376 --> 00:07:16,376
Harupyon is the best friend I want to
make a girlfriend.

124
00:07:16,376 --> 00:07:18,376
What do you mean?

125
00:07:19,376 --> 00:07:23,376
Harupyon is really considerate.

126
00:07:23,376 --> 00:07:25,376
No, no, it's my line.

127
00:07:25,376 --> 00:07:26,376
No, no, no.

128
00:07:26,376 --> 00:07:32,256
He's really good at cooking.

129
00:07:32,256 --> 00:07:38,796
I feel relieved just by talking to him.

130
00:07:38,796 --> 00:07:40,376
Really?

131
00:07:40,376 --> 00:07:43,776
But when I say that,

132
00:07:43,776 --> 00:07:44,896
Haru-chan says,

133
00:07:44,896 --> 00:07:47,336
I want to be your boyfriend.

134
00:07:49,096 --> 00:07:50,536
Do you remember what you said?

135
00:07:50,536 --> 00:07:51,216
You said it.

136
00:07:51,216 --> 00:07:53,616
I don't know if I remember.

137
00:07:53,616 --> 00:07:57,840
년

138
00:07:57,840 --> 00:08:27,264
, I wonder if I really have Harupyon in
me. I wonder if I'm relying on you. I
thought so. Because when we were in the
basement, we were a little bit together.

139
00:08:27,264 --> 00:08:32,904
Do you remember crying at the hotel?

140
00:08:32,904 --> 00:08:35,224
I remember.

141
00:08:35,224 --> 00:08:38,424
We were next to each other in the room.

142
00:08:38,424 --> 00:08:42,984
We were talking and talking.

143
00:08:42,984 --> 00:08:45,168
That's right.

144
00:08:45,168 --> 00:08:47,168
You cried together, didn't you?

145
00:08:47,168 --> 00:08:49,168
I did.

146
00:08:51,168 --> 00:08:55,168
I was crying in the bathroom.

147
00:08:55,168 --> 00:08:59,168
I was like, Harupyon, are you okay? Come
out.

148
00:08:59,168 --> 00:09:02,168
Wait a minute.

149
00:09:04,168 --> 00:09:06,168
Really.

150
00:09:06,168 --> 00:09:13,920
I was really supported at that time.

151
00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:23,920
そうだよね。なんか、私たち結構さ、なんかこう、人との関わりをさ、

152
00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:24,920
うんうんうん。

153
00:09:24,920 --> 00:09:32,920
すごくさ、大事にしたいって、こう、強く思いがちというかさ、

154
00:09:32,920 --> 00:09:33,920
そうだね。

155
00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:34,920
すごいそういう気持ちが強いじゃない?

156
00:09:34,920 --> 00:09:35,920
確かに、そうかも。

157
00:09:35,920 --> 00:09:39,312
だから、こう、なんだろうな。

158
00:09:39,312 --> 00:09:44,212
People want to believe more than their
own capes.

159
00:09:44,212 --> 00:09:45,212
That's right.

160
00:09:45,212 --> 00:09:47,212
I'm sure that's the case.

161
00:09:47,212 --> 00:09:55,212
I couldn't organize it, but I really
believed in people and liked them.

162
00:09:55,212 --> 00:09:59,212
I was probably 16, 17 years old at that
time.

163
00:09:59,212 --> 00:10:05,212
So, I don't even know how to worry.

164
00:10:05,212 --> 00:10:06,816
That's right.

165
00:10:06,816 --> 00:10:13,256
But you know, I'm worried about
something similar. That's right. That
might be the case.

166
00:10:13,256 --> 00:10:17,896
That's why I get a lot of encouragement
from my parents.

167
00:10:17,896 --> 00:10:24,776
I get a lot of advice from my parents. I
get a lot of advice from my parents.

168
00:10:24,776 --> 00:10:31,616
Really? But I really like people.

169
00:10:31,616 --> 00:10:35,568
Yeah, yeah, yeah. It's been like that
for a long time.

170
00:10:35,568 --> 00:10:44,568
I was with Miu-tan and I was watching
her live.

171
00:10:44,568 --> 00:10:49,568
I thought, there's a song that makes me
think,

172
00:10:49,568 --> 00:10:53,568
there's a song that makes me think,

173
00:10:53,568 --> 00:10:58,800
Something for the invited concert and a
tea.

174
00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:03,600
You gave me an album after the concert.

175
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:05,300
Do you remember?

176
00:11:05,300 --> 00:11:10,800
I still read that black file.

177
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:15,100
I don't remember until you say it's
nostalgic.

178
00:11:15,100 --> 00:11:17,300
Really?

179
00:11:17,300 --> 00:11:19,500
You made it so well.

180
00:11:19,500 --> 00:11:21,800
You made it.

181
00:11:21,800 --> 00:11:21,936
Something for the songs

182
00:11:21,936 --> 00:11:28,936
I cut the photos into hearts and made
it.

183
00:11:28,936 --> 00:11:32,936
I was so moved by that.

184
00:11:32,936 --> 00:11:33,936
Really?

185
00:11:33,936 --> 00:11:41,936
I thought you were a really warm person.

186
00:11:41,936 --> 00:11:46,992
But I also like Harupyon's...

187
00:11:46,992 --> 00:11:51,992
I'm not asking for advice, but I've
heard some of your concerns.

188
00:11:51,992 --> 00:11:53,992
Like...

189
00:11:53,992 --> 00:11:57,992
I want to be of some help to you.

190
00:11:57,992 --> 00:12:00,992
Thinking about it...

191
00:12:00,992 --> 00:12:05,992
It's connected to my own sanity.

192
00:12:05,992 --> 00:12:08,016
So...

193
00:12:08,016 --> 00:12:15,616
When I think about people, I wonder what
would happen if I changed that.

194
00:12:15,616 --> 00:12:23,936
When I talk to Harupyon, I feel like I'm
being purified.

195
00:12:23,936 --> 00:12:25,736
Yeah.

196
00:12:25,736 --> 00:12:29,856
But Harupyon, even now...

197
00:12:29,856 --> 00:12:32,856
Is there anything you want to cry about?

198
00:12:32,856 --> 00:12:34,856
Something I want to cry about?

199
00:12:34,856 --> 00:12:37,856
It doesn't matter if you're sad or
happy.

200
00:12:40,856 --> 00:12:43,856
Is there anything?

201
00:12:43,856 --> 00:12:47,856
Harupyon and I used to cry a lot back
then.

202
00:12:47,856 --> 00:12:49,856
You used to cry.

203
00:12:50,856 --> 00:12:52,856
Yeah, I guess so.

204
00:12:53,856 --> 00:12:55,856
Even now...

205
00:12:55,856 --> 00:12:56,688
I guess so.

206
00:12:56,688 --> 00:13:03,688
I think I've gotten stronger than I was
before.

207
00:13:03,688 --> 00:13:08,688
But I wonder...

208
00:13:08,688 --> 00:13:16,688
I wonder if I have any worries.

209
00:13:16,688 --> 00:13:22,688
I wonder if this is right.

210
00:13:22,688 --> 00:13:25,632
What is my...

211
00:13:25,632 --> 00:13:27,632
Actions and stuff.

212
00:13:27,632 --> 00:13:29,632
That's why, really...

213
00:13:32,632 --> 00:13:36,632
When I'm with Miyu-tan, I really feel...

214
00:13:36,632 --> 00:13:40,632
It's really, you know, a kick-off.

215
00:13:40,632 --> 00:13:43,632
Something around me...

216
00:13:44,632 --> 00:13:47,632
It really makes the environment one.

217
00:13:47,632 --> 00:13:49,584
Miyu-tan, you know.

218
00:13:49,584 --> 00:13:55,584
I talked a lot during the interview the
other day.

219
00:13:55,584 --> 00:14:02,584
So I think it's great to see that.

220
00:14:02,584 --> 00:14:12,584
When I was in the lead role, I was
wondering if I could do it.

221
00:14:12,584 --> 00:14:19,584
I think I'm thinking about it.

222
00:14:19,680 --> 00:14:21,680
I see.

223
00:14:21,680 --> 00:14:35,680
There was a time when I was worried that
I might not be suitable for an actress.

224
00:14:35,680 --> 00:14:45,680
At that time, I couldn't say good words
to you.

225
00:14:45,680 --> 00:14:47,680
Why?

226
00:14:47,680 --> 00:14:49,296
I'm sorry.

227
00:14:49,296 --> 00:15:05,296
I really want to be like this, not a
worry about Harupyon.

228
00:15:05,296 --> 00:15:09,072
I was worried about Harupyon.

229
00:15:09,072 --> 00:15:14,072
I want to teach Harupyon now.

230
00:15:16,072 --> 00:15:20,072
I think it's shining.

231
00:15:21,072 --> 00:15:26,072
It's the same as when I watch it on TV.

232
00:15:26,072 --> 00:15:36,144
It's the same as when I was working.

233
00:15:36,144 --> 00:15:52,144
I don't know if I'm going to the good or
not, but I feel like I'm starting to
climb the stairs from Harupyon at that
time.

234
00:15:52,144 --> 00:15:57,144
I think I have to do my best.

235
00:15:57,144 --> 00:16:03,840
Why are you happy?

236
00:16:03,840 --> 00:16:05,840
I'm so happy.

237
00:16:05,840 --> 00:16:07,840
You're so understanding.

238
00:16:07,840 --> 00:16:09,840
Oh, wait.

239
00:16:09,840 --> 00:16:11,840
I...

240
00:16:11,840 --> 00:16:15,840
I listened to Harupyo's new song the
other day.

241
00:16:15,840 --> 00:16:17,840
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

242
00:16:17,840 --> 00:16:18,840
Thank you.

243
00:16:18,840 --> 00:16:20,840
I collaborated with Okamotozu.

244
00:16:20,840 --> 00:16:23,328
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

245
00:16:23,328 --> 00:16:27,328
I like bands and I listen to them a lot.

246
00:16:27,328 --> 00:16:28,328
Oh, really?

247
00:16:28,328 --> 00:16:32,328
I thought it was a mysterious
combination.

248
00:16:32,328 --> 00:16:43,296
I was really excited to hear that.

249
00:16:43,296 --> 00:16:45,296
I like that.

250
00:16:45,296 --> 00:16:52,296
I feel like I can see a different side
of Harupyon, the artist I've seen
before.

251
00:16:52,296 --> 00:16:53,296
Really?

252
00:16:53,296 --> 00:16:54,296
Yeah.

253
00:16:54,296 --> 00:16:56,296
I'm so happy.

254
00:16:56,296 --> 00:16:58,296
I wanted to tell you a lot today.

255
00:16:58,296 --> 00:16:59,296
Really?

256
00:16:59,296 --> 00:17:00,296
Yeah.

257
00:17:01,296 --> 00:17:03,296
I wanted to tell you a lot.

258
00:17:03,296 --> 00:17:05,296
I'm so happy. Thank you.

259
00:17:05,296 --> 00:17:09,296
You know, Harupyon is...

260
00:17:09,296 --> 00:17:10,896
What is it?

261
00:17:10,896 --> 00:17:13,476
Probably days before we went to a live
performance?

262
00:17:14,376 --> 00:17:30,936
Long time ago...

263
00:17:30,936 --> 00:17:37,296
I have a job, so I was asked if I could
go to karaoke.

264
00:17:37,296 --> 00:17:38,688
I was asked if I could go to karaoke.

265
00:17:38,688 --> 00:17:40,688
Do you remember?

266
00:17:40,688 --> 00:17:42,688
I don't remember.

267
00:17:42,688 --> 00:17:44,688
You went with Haru-kun.

268
00:17:44,688 --> 00:17:54,688
Before the singing job, you said you
couldn't swallow your throat.

269
00:17:54,688 --> 00:18:02,688
How much did you sing the day before?

270
00:18:02,688 --> 00:18:08,448
I was wondering about karaoke, and Haru-
kun kept saying...

271
00:18:08,448 --> 00:18:11,408
I put my own song in it, and...

272
00:18:11,888 --> 00:18:16,968
I've been practicing for the next day's
work.

273
00:18:16,968 --> 00:18:25,968
But at that time, I was doing an
actress, and I was also doing a variety
show MC.

274
00:18:25,968 --> 00:18:27,968
Ah, Hoshitsu?

275
00:18:27,968 --> 00:18:33,928
Yes, I was also doing voice actors and
singers.

276
00:18:33,928 --> 00:18:36,864
I was doing various genres.

277
00:18:36,864 --> 00:18:46,864
Harupyon, who is working hard and is
moving people, is very important to each
and every one of them.

278
00:18:46,864 --> 00:18:52,864
I feel like I like singers, artists, and
jobs.

279
00:18:52,864 --> 00:18:58,864
Do you have any dreams as an artist?

280
00:18:58,864 --> 00:19:01,864
A dream as an artist?

281
00:19:01,864 --> 00:19:04,864
Hmm...

282
00:19:04,864 --> 00:19:06,816
But...

283
00:19:06,816 --> 00:19:11,816
I want to make a song that people listen
to can be a good idea,

284
00:19:11,816 --> 00:19:20,816
or a song that can be shared with
others.

285
00:19:21,816 --> 00:19:29,816
I want to make a healing space.

286
00:19:29,816 --> 00:19:35,816
And I want to make a live performance
for many people.

287
00:19:36,528 --> 00:19:38,528
I want to perform on the stage.

288
00:19:38,528 --> 00:19:39,528
Sounds good.

289
00:19:39,528 --> 00:19:40,528
I want to go.

290
00:19:40,528 --> 00:19:42,528
I want you to come.

291
00:19:42,528 --> 00:19:43,528
I want to go.

292
00:19:43,528 --> 00:19:45,528
I don't plan to go.

293
00:19:47,528 --> 00:19:51,528
Please call me at that time.

294
00:19:51,528 --> 00:19:56,528
I want to give you something.

295
00:19:56,528 --> 00:19:57,552
What?

296
00:19:57,552 --> 00:20:06,552
I think the drawer is on the desk. Can
you open it?

297
00:20:06,552 --> 00:20:08,552
What?

298
00:20:12,552 --> 00:20:13,552
What is this?

299
00:20:13,552 --> 00:20:15,552
What's in it?

300
00:20:15,552 --> 00:20:17,552
What is this? Like a book?

301
00:20:17,552 --> 00:20:19,552
Yes, a little...

302
00:20:19,552 --> 00:20:22,656
What?

303
00:20:22,656 --> 00:20:26,656
Hey, it's nostalgic.

304
00:20:26,656 --> 00:20:30,656
Wait, what?

305
00:20:30,656 --> 00:20:34,656
Oh, what?

306
00:20:34,656 --> 00:20:39,656
I thought I'd write a letter for a long
time.

307
00:20:39,656 --> 00:20:42,656
Simple.

308
00:20:42,656 --> 00:20:46,656
Something like this.

309
00:20:46,656 --> 00:20:50,656
I think it's a genre that we talk about
when we're working.

310
00:20:51,656 --> 00:20:53,656
There are private things.

311
00:20:54,656 --> 00:20:57,656
We have a lot of relationships.

312
00:20:58,656 --> 00:21:02,656
We have a lot of things to do.

313
00:21:03,656 --> 00:21:05,656
But...

314
00:21:05,656 --> 00:21:13,248
I simply want to say thank you for being
my friend.

315
00:21:13,248 --> 00:21:17,248
That's what I wanted to say.

316
00:21:19,248 --> 00:21:21,248
I'm so happy.

317
00:21:22,248 --> 00:21:24,248
The photo...

318
00:21:25,248 --> 00:21:26,248
I remember it.

319
00:21:26,248 --> 00:21:33,248
It's the first time I took a photo with
Harupyon.

320
00:21:34,248 --> 00:21:39,248
I was thinking it was a bit cheesy.

321
00:21:39,248 --> 00:21:42,248
But I've been doing it since then.

322
00:21:42,576 --> 00:21:45,176
About 6 years.

323
00:21:45,176 --> 00:21:53,976
We've been sharing a lot of joys and
sorrows.

324
00:21:54,976 --> 00:21:59,976
I'm grateful that we've become friends.

325
00:22:01,376 --> 00:22:05,976
I just want to say this.

326
00:22:05,976 --> 00:22:07,376
Me too.

327
00:22:07,376 --> 00:22:10,896
I'm so happy.

328
00:22:10,896 --> 00:22:11,896
Yes.

329
00:22:11,896 --> 00:22:13,896
Thank you.

330
00:22:13,896 --> 00:22:24,896
I'm sure there are a lot of hard things
ahead of you, but please consult me
anytime.

331
00:22:24,896 --> 00:22:26,448
Um...

332
00:22:26,448 --> 00:22:30,448
Thank you for being my friend.

333
00:22:32,448 --> 00:22:37,448
There aren't many people I can consult
with.

334
00:22:39,448 --> 00:22:45,448
I've been talking about a lot of private
things rather than work.

335
00:22:46,448 --> 00:22:49,448
I've been working hard together.

336
00:22:49,448 --> 00:22:55,392
I'm a very special person.

337
00:22:55,392 --> 00:23:00,392
I'm going to cry.

338
00:23:00,392 --> 00:23:03,392
Don't cry.

339
00:23:03,392 --> 00:23:05,392
Thank you.

340
00:23:05,392 --> 00:23:09,392
I'll put this picture in my house.

341
00:23:09,392 --> 00:23:10,392
Thank you.

342
00:23:10,392 --> 00:23:12,392
I'll go play at home again.

343
00:23:12,392 --> 00:23:14,392
Come and see me.

344
00:23:14,392 --> 00:23:16,392
Please take care of my mother.

345
00:23:16,392 --> 00:23:17,392
Thank you.

346
00:23:17,392 --> 00:23:20,256
I'll give my mother a croquette.

347
00:23:20,256 --> 00:23:24,256
I want to eat avocado croquette.

348
00:23:24,256 --> 00:23:29,256
I'll give you. Thank you.

349
00:23:29,256 --> 00:23:35,256
Let's meet again. See you.

350
00:23:35,256 --> 00:23:49,721
Bye bye. See you.
