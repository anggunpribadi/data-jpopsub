1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Night view and idols

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:10,000
Now, let's get to the ending

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:13,000
Do you have any announcements?

4
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:14,000
Yes!

5
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:18,000
The new EP of Team Shachi, which is
currently on sale,

6
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,000
is called,

7
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:27,000
What kind of difficulties will we
overcome when we look to the future?

8
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:29,408
Yes! Among them is...

9
00:00:29,408 --> 00:00:35,408
There are many wonderful songs, such as
Edome, which was composed by Enon
Kawatani,

10
00:00:35,408 --> 00:00:40,408
and Hikari, which I also composed.

11
00:00:40,408 --> 00:00:43,408
Please listen to them!

12
00:00:43,408 --> 00:00:47,408
And on Saturday, December 24th,

13
00:00:47,408 --> 00:00:51,952
we will hold a big concert for One Man
Live!

14
00:00:52,952 --> 00:00:55,952
We are very grateful for this
opportunity.

15
00:00:55,952 --> 00:01:00,952
We will be performing a live show to
show our gratitude for this year.

16
00:01:00,952 --> 00:01:03,952
The venue is Tokyo Shinagawa Stellar
Ball.

17
00:01:03,952 --> 00:01:07,952
Part 1 will start at 2.30pm and Part 2
will start at 6.30pm.

18
00:01:07,952 --> 00:01:09,952
We are a band.

19
00:01:09,952 --> 00:01:16,952
We will be performing live shows, but we
will also be performing acoustic songs.

20
00:01:16,952 --> 00:01:19,952
We will also be performing cover songs.

21
00:01:19,952 --> 00:01:23,952
It will be a live show to show our
gratitude for this year.

22
00:01:23,952 --> 00:01:26,952
I think it will be a mature kind of live
show.

23
00:01:26,952 --> 00:01:29,952
Please come and see us.

24
00:01:29,952 --> 00:01:31,952
There won't be a mini-Suka-san, right?

25
00:01:31,952 --> 00:01:32,336
Please come and see us!

26
00:01:33,336 --> 00:01:39,336
Santa Claus? No, I'm sorry. I'm just a
night watchman.

27
00:01:39,336 --> 00:01:44,336
I'll be careful.

28
00:01:44,336 --> 00:01:47,336
I'm sorry. I'll be grateful.

29
00:01:47,336 --> 00:01:50,336
And on Saturday, January 14th, the year-
end,

30
00:01:50,336 --> 00:01:57,336
We will be at the SAPPLA IDOL FESTIVAL
held at Yokohama Arena.

31
00:01:57,336 --> 00:02:05,336
I'm looking forward to the fact that
SAPPLA IDOL will gather once a year.

32
00:02:05,808 --> 00:02:10,208
I'm going to choose a Cinderella group.

33
00:02:10,208 --> 00:02:12,208
I've always chosen Cinderella.

34
00:02:12,208 --> 00:02:18,408
I don't have a cute impression of
Cinderella at all.

35
00:02:18,408 --> 00:02:22,408
I'm serious about this.

36
00:02:22,408 --> 00:02:24,008
Thank you.

37
00:02:24,008 --> 00:02:26,672
I think I'll be number one if I make a
car marathon.

38
00:02:27,672 --> 00:02:29,672
I don't think I can do a live.

39
00:02:29,672 --> 00:02:32,672
Even if I do, I can't do a full
marathon.

40
00:02:32,672 --> 00:02:38,672
Full marathon is 4 hours, so I don't
think I can run a long distance.

41
00:02:38,672 --> 00:02:42,672
I think it's better to show the cute
side of idols.

42
00:02:42,672 --> 00:02:46,672
I think I'll be getting more and more
tight.

43
00:02:46,672 --> 00:02:52,672
I think the only thing I can do for
Kimoto is to be cute at a long distance.

44
00:02:53,768 --> 00:02:56,768
I can't do it for the manager.

45
00:02:56,768 --> 00:02:58,768
I'm looking forward to it.

46
00:02:58,768 --> 00:03:03,768
And after that, we will have a one-man
live.

47
00:03:03,768 --> 00:03:07,768
On January 28th, Saturday, at Aichi
Prefecture's ZEPP Nagoya.

48
00:03:07,768 --> 00:03:11,768
And on February 25th, Saturday, at
Tokyo's Line Cube Shibuya.

49
00:03:11,768 --> 00:03:13,768
We will have a one-man live.

50
00:03:13,768 --> 00:03:15,768
This is also big.

51
00:03:15,768 --> 00:03:16,768
Thank you.

52
00:03:16,768 --> 00:03:18,768
I'll do something completely different.

53
00:03:18,768 --> 00:03:23,768
ZEPP Nagoya is a Tokyo Kingdom site.

54
00:03:23,768 --> 00:03:25,768
Tokyo Kingdom.

55
00:03:25,768 --> 00:03:29,768
I want to push the Tokyo area a little
bit.

56
00:03:29,768 --> 00:03:31,768
I want to do a live.

57
00:03:31,768 --> 00:03:35,768
And on the Line Cube Shibuya, we will
have a festival called Hachikarnival.

58
00:03:35,768 --> 00:03:41,768
We are working on a world festival.

59
00:03:41,768 --> 00:03:46,768
There is a subtitle called Wakuwaku
without a mask.

60
00:03:46,768 --> 00:03:51,768
It's a carnival that takes off your
mask.

61
00:03:51,768 --> 00:03:53,768
An idol who takes off his mask.

62
00:03:53,768 --> 00:03:55,768
Don't you have to go?

63
00:03:55,768 --> 00:03:57,768
I want everyone to come.

64
00:03:57,768 --> 00:03:59,768
I'll buy it again.

65
00:03:59,768 --> 00:04:00,768
Thank you.

66
00:04:00,768 --> 00:04:02,768
I'm waiting.

67
00:04:02,768 --> 00:04:05,768
Can I give you a present from YAKAN?

68
00:04:05,768 --> 00:04:06,768
Yes.

69
00:04:06,768 --> 00:04:10,768
I'll give you some tea.

70
00:04:10,768 --> 00:04:12,768
Please drink it.

71
00:04:12,768 --> 00:04:14,768
Yay!

72
00:04:14,768 --> 00:04:18,768
I prepared Jasmine tea this time.

73
00:04:18,768 --> 00:04:20,768
I love Jasmine tea.

74
00:04:20,768 --> 00:04:22,768
Really?

75
00:04:22,768 --> 00:04:28,768
I hope you will enjoy it.

76
00:04:28,768 --> 00:04:33,456
Please subscribe to my channel.

77
00:04:34,456 --> 00:04:36,456
It's refreshing!

78
00:04:37,456 --> 00:04:38,456
It's delicious!

79
00:04:38,456 --> 00:04:40,456
It tastes like it's going to sell.

80
00:04:41,456 --> 00:04:42,456
Thank you.

81
00:04:42,456 --> 00:04:43,456
Thank you.

82
00:04:43,456 --> 00:04:45,456
Now that the refreshing wind has blown,

83
00:04:45,456 --> 00:04:49,456
I'd like you to close the last part of
the show.

84
00:04:50,456 --> 00:04:55,456
I'd like everyone to come to our live
event.

85
00:04:55,456 --> 00:04:59,456
If you don't come, I'll make miso and
eat it.

86
00:04:59,456 --> 00:05:01,456
Thank you very much.

87
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:06,160
See you!

88
00:05:25,344 --> 00:05:32,844
I sent it to Kuribon11153

89
00:05:32,844 --> 00:05:38,401
I'm sure there will be good things
tomorrow.
