1
00:00:00,282 --> 00:00:06,282
So, the 10th, 11th, and 12th Heisei
Isokintorio's gathering is now over.

2
00:00:06,282 --> 00:00:08,282
Thank you everyone.

3
00:00:08,282 --> 00:00:23,282
This time, Heisei Isokintorio is a unit
held in 2016 by me, Hinnata Kashiwagi,
and Shikaho Kobayashi, and Riko
Nakayama.

4
00:00:23,282 --> 00:00:31,282
This time, we are going to the unit held
in the university hall, Heisei
Isokintorio.

5
00:00:31,282 --> 00:00:42,282
This time, we are going to the venue, so
we have to go to Heisei Isokintorio.

6
00:00:42,282 --> 00:01:00,282
We only did one or two times at the
concert, so we thought it would be nice
to sing the song that we have grown up
singing.

7
00:01:00,282 --> 00:01:05,282
So, we decided to put together the title
of Heisei Isokintorio's gathering.

8
00:01:05,282 --> 00:01:23,282
The members of the 10th year team were
friends who had been together for more
than 10 years, and we were doing a live
performance that felt the history of
Ebichu.

9
00:01:23,282 --> 00:01:35,282
This time, we will put together the
favorite songs of all three members
rather than the history.

10
00:01:35,282 --> 00:01:48,282
Of course, there is a big selection to
do the Heisei Isokintorio's gathering,
but there is a song called Diving.

11
00:01:48,282 --> 00:01:56,282
Originally, it was not Ebichu's song,
but it was a song of 3B Junior.

12
00:01:56,282 --> 00:02:21,282
It's a song that was played when I was
in 3B Junior, and there was a group
called Team Daioika before entering
Ebichu.

13
00:02:21,282 --> 00:02:27,282
Can you be quiet for a moment?

14
00:02:27,282 --> 00:02:37,282
I'm sorry, my eyes are noisy.

15
00:02:37,282 --> 00:02:52,282
I was also doing Diving, so I thought it
was better to do it. I didn't put it in
the 10th year team, so I didn't put it
in the audience.

16
00:02:52,282 --> 00:03:06,906
I thought it was a good song, but it
wasn't here, so I brought it to the
first song. The second song is Butterfly
Effect.

17
00:03:06,906 --> 00:03:09,426
This song keeps,​

18
00:03:09,006 --> 00:03:07,886
telling the own story, but

19
00:03:10,066 --> 00:03:11,726
changes things a lot.

20
00:03:12,366 --> 00:03:13,666
I work on the previous one.

21
00:03:16,026 --> 00:03:18,626
What was the new one?​

22
00:03:20,406 --> 00:03:29,806
If you listen to it from now onto, it
kind of feels like...​

23
00:03:29,806 --> 00:03:38,146
I really like Kaho's songs, which are
very expressive, and have a good
atmosphere.

24
00:03:38,146 --> 00:03:47,346
Riko is powerful and fun, and I liked
the song with power and coolness.

25
00:03:47,346 --> 00:03:51,886
I wanted to put this on the set list, so
I thought I'd put it on the set list.

26
00:03:51,886 --> 00:04:02,126
So, before we sang in a room, we had
memories with each other in our heads.

27
00:04:02,126 --> 00:04:06,246
After that, the four songs were a little
more blue than Riko's.

28
00:04:06,246 --> 00:04:08,606
Like the star name Armure Manager.

29
00:04:08,606 --> 00:04:13,606
That was Riko's, and the block was asked
after the unit was over.

30
00:04:13,606 --> 00:04:18,526
From the 23rd Summer Night to the set
list of Kaho's,

31
00:04:18,526 --> 00:04:23,326
and finally, the song that Kaho wanted
to do the most, Chupacabra.

32
00:04:23,326 --> 00:04:26,086
The song that Riko wanted to do the
most, Forever 15.

33
00:04:26,086 --> 00:04:33,046
And the three songs, Tamageta, Koi no
Elunini.

34
00:04:33,046 --> 00:04:37,326
It was a really fun live performance.

35
00:04:37,326 --> 00:04:40,686
It was the same as last time, when we
were 10 years old.

36
00:04:40,686 --> 00:04:47,806
It was a live performance that could be
performed only because of this member.

37
00:04:47,806 --> 00:04:52,686
And, well, it's an encore, right?

38
00:04:52,686 --> 00:04:56,206
I think everyone was surprised.

39
00:04:56,206 --> 00:05:03,566
Well, before this Kashiwagi project
started,

40
00:05:03,566 --> 00:05:08,846
we announced that we would do four
performances of the Produce performance
that was a family performance.

41
00:05:08,846 --> 00:05:15,926
From there, we asked for things that we
wanted to do with the hashtag Kashiwagi
project,

42
00:05:15,926 --> 00:05:18,606
and asked if there were any requests for
things like this.

43
00:05:18,606 --> 00:05:23,206
When I asked on Twitter,

44
00:05:23,206 --> 00:05:28,806
well, it's not an exaggeration to say
that it was a lot of chaos.

45
00:05:28,806 --> 00:05:30,800
So that6 people...

46
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:43,080
最後のライブを見たいですという声が 本当にありがたいことに多くて
ライブの中でも言ったんですけど 6 voicesっていう

47
00:05:43,080 --> 00:05:48,680
スワーじゃないですけど 何か所かでやらせていただいたときは

48
00:05:48,680 --> 00:06:00,000
綾香が療養中でお休みで 綾香以外の5人でステージに立って
声は綾香の歌をそのまま使うっていうような

49
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:04,176
6人の声というのをテーマにしたライブを

50
00:06:04,176 --> 00:06:07,176
we decided to have a new member.

51
00:06:07,176 --> 00:06:09,176
We were doing that.

52
00:06:09,176 --> 00:06:12,176
Before that, Mirei-chan was injured,

53
00:06:12,176 --> 00:06:14,176
Ayaka was on leave,

54
00:06:14,176 --> 00:06:19,176
and we couldn't really do a live with 6
people.

55
00:06:19,176 --> 00:06:21,176
What was it?

56
00:06:21,176 --> 00:06:24,176
The first one was 2018.

57
00:06:24,176 --> 00:06:31,176
It felt like we were doing a spring tour
with 6 people.

58
00:06:31,176 --> 00:06:41,176
We wanted to do a live with 6 people,

59
00:06:41,176 --> 00:06:45,176
but it was hard to do that.

60
00:06:45,176 --> 00:06:49,176
We got requests for a live performance,

61
00:06:49,176 --> 00:06:56,176
so I thought I could do it.

62
00:06:56,176 --> 00:07:03,176
So we contacted everyone and said we
wanted to do a live performance with 6
people.

63
00:07:03,176 --> 00:07:08,176
They said they didn't think we could do
it,

64
00:07:08,176 --> 00:07:12,176
so we were really happy.

65
00:07:12,176 --> 00:07:14,176
So we decided to do it.

66
00:07:14,176 --> 00:07:19,176
The set list was the same.

67
00:07:19,176 --> 00:07:21,176
Everyone wanted to do it,

68
00:07:21,176 --> 00:07:24,176
so we decided to do it.

69
00:07:24,176 --> 00:07:26,176
We were doing it,

70
00:07:26,176 --> 00:07:31,952
and we remembered a lot of things from
the 6 of us.

71
00:07:31,952 --> 00:07:33,952
We almost cried on the road.

72
00:07:35,952 --> 00:07:42,952
The first song was the beginning of the
6 of us.

73
00:07:44,952 --> 00:07:46,952
There were a lot of things that I
thought about.

74
00:07:46,952 --> 00:07:50,576
I thought that the encore wasn't an
encore.

75
00:07:50,576 --> 00:07:58,576
I was planning to put this in and do a 2
hour live.

76
00:07:58,576 --> 00:08:02,576
I heard that I was doing a 2 hour 40
minute live.

77
00:08:02,576 --> 00:08:06,112
It's been a while since I did a live.

78
00:08:06,112 --> 00:08:11,812
I think everyone at Isokin did a good
job.

79
00:08:11,812 --> 00:08:18,712
I think we did a good job of making the
volume of the university stage.

80
00:08:18,712 --> 00:08:24,412
And I'm really grateful to Maya, Aya,
and Mirei for coming.

81
00:08:24,412 --> 00:08:30,812
I'm really grateful to all the fans who
have been waiting for me to do a live
performance.

82
00:08:30,812 --> 00:08:41,212
I was really happy to see a lot of
people watching the last live
performance, including the delivery.

83
00:08:41,212 --> 00:08:49,112
Isokin is full of the personality of
Kawa and Riko.

84
00:08:49,112 --> 00:08:54,712
I think that's another attraction and I
think I was able to do a live
performance.

85
00:08:54,712 --> 00:08:59,612
It was a really big volume live
performance.

86
00:08:59,612 --> 00:09:01,812
I hope you all enjoy it.

87
00:09:01,812 --> 00:09:07,712
It's really a live performance that will
be remembered and remembered by us.

88
00:09:07,712 --> 00:09:15,281
Thank you very much.
