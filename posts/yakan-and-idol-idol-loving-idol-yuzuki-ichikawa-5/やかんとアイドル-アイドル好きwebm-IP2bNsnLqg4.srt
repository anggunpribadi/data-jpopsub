1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,660
It's night the daru

2
00:00:09,626 --> 00:00:13,626
Do you have any announcements?

3
00:00:13,626 --> 00:00:18,626
We are going to be doing a live stream
on YouTube every Monday at 8pm.

4
00:00:18,626 --> 00:00:22,626
It's called Amahira Shaberi, and we're
going to be shooting it in the middle of
the night.

5
00:00:22,626 --> 00:00:26,626
We're going to be doing it for the 100th
time.

6
00:00:26,626 --> 00:00:34,626
I hope you'll be able to see us in a
more fun and linear way every Monday.

7
00:00:34,626 --> 00:00:35,626
Please look forward to it.

8
00:00:35,626 --> 00:00:37,626
What's next?

9
00:00:37,626 --> 00:00:46,626
After talking about the rain, we're
going to be doing a radio show called
Oame Chuiho, which is a rain-related
news program.

10
00:00:46,626 --> 00:00:49,626
You're doing a regular program on the
Inter-NUM, right?

11
00:00:49,626 --> 00:00:50,626
That's right.

12
00:00:50,626 --> 00:00:52,626
30 minutes every Monday.

13
00:00:52,626 --> 00:00:53,626
Four of us?

14
00:00:53,626 --> 00:00:54,626
We're doing it with four people.

15
00:00:54,626 --> 00:01:00,626
I've been doing it with Shinagaki
Mainabi lately.

16
00:01:00,626 --> 00:01:07,626
I've been doing it with a guest, and
I've been doing it with IME.

17
00:01:07,626 --> 00:01:09,626
That's amazing.

18
00:01:09,626 --> 00:01:10,626
That's right.

19
00:01:10,626 --> 00:01:12,626
Are you wearing it properly?

20
00:01:12,626 --> 00:01:14,626
Please stop looking at me like that.

21
00:01:14,626 --> 00:01:16,626
I'm just kidding.

22
00:01:16,626 --> 00:01:18,626
Who's next?

23
00:01:18,626 --> 00:01:21,626
I'm going to be doing it with Ame-chan.

24
00:01:21,626 --> 00:01:26,626
She's the one who makes NFT art.

25
00:01:26,626 --> 00:01:36,626
Kojima Hana sold NFT art, so I asked her
to learn from the beginning.

26
00:01:36,626 --> 00:01:40,626
It's a corner of the frame.

27
00:01:40,626 --> 00:01:46,626
Before that, we talked about our daily
lives.

28
00:01:46,626 --> 00:01:51,626
The time has changed to 9.30, but before
that, it was about 11 o'clock.

29
00:01:51,626 --> 00:01:55,626
At that time, it was said that it was a
radio that couldn't sleep.

30
00:01:55,626 --> 00:01:57,626
It's a bad radio that's uncomfortable to
sleep on.

31
00:01:57,626 --> 00:01:58,626
That's nice.

32
00:01:58,626 --> 00:02:00,626
What do you do in your free time?

33
00:02:00,626 --> 00:02:06,626
It's not a comfortable radio that you
can sleep on before you go to bed.

34
00:02:06,626 --> 00:02:08,626
I'm doing this on the radio.

35
00:02:08,626 --> 00:02:10,626
I'm doing a shoulder-pulling.

36
00:02:10,626 --> 00:02:14,626
If you mix this with this food, it'll be
like this.

37
00:02:14,626 --> 00:02:17,626
What happens if you mix honey and
yogurt?

38
00:02:17,626 --> 00:02:19,626
I'm doing that.

39
00:02:19,626 --> 00:02:20,626
I'm doing that.

40
00:02:20,626 --> 00:02:22,626
I'm doing that.

41
00:02:22,626 --> 00:02:25,626
I'm doing things that I wouldn't do on
the radio.

42
00:02:25,626 --> 00:02:27,626
Please listen to it.

43
00:02:27,626 --> 00:02:28,626
Yes.

44
00:02:28,626 --> 00:02:33,626
Finally, I'd like you to drink tea to
cheer you up.

45
00:02:33,626 --> 00:02:36,352
I'm going to drink tea today.

46
00:02:37,352 --> 00:02:39,352
Jasmine tea.

47
00:02:39,352 --> 00:02:40,352
Is it okay?

48
00:02:40,352 --> 00:02:42,352
I don't usually drink tea.

49
00:02:42,352 --> 00:02:44,352
I don't usually drink green tea.

50
00:02:44,352 --> 00:02:46,352
I don't usually drink it.

51
00:02:46,352 --> 00:02:48,352
What's that image?

52
00:02:48,352 --> 00:02:49,352
It's my own image.

53
00:02:49,352 --> 00:02:51,352
I made it up.

54
00:02:51,352 --> 00:02:53,352
But I don't usually drink it.

55
00:02:53,352 --> 00:02:56,352
But I love Karada Square Kacha.

56
00:02:56,352 --> 00:02:58,352
I drink it every day.

57
00:02:58,352 --> 00:03:00,352
I'll have it.

58
00:03:00,352 --> 00:03:02,352
Is it hot?

59
00:03:02,352 --> 00:03:04,352
It's delicious.

60
00:03:07,352 --> 00:03:09,352
Jasmine tea is not so tasty.

61
00:03:09,352 --> 00:03:10,352
It's very delicious.

62
00:03:10,352 --> 00:03:13,352
I don't drink tea, but I can eat Sadobu.

63
00:03:13,352 --> 00:03:14,352
I see.

64
00:03:14,352 --> 00:03:15,352
I eat sweets.

65
00:03:15,352 --> 00:03:16,352
You eat sweets?

66
00:03:16,352 --> 00:03:17,352
Yes.

67
00:03:17,352 --> 00:03:18,352
Like a snack?

68
00:03:18,352 --> 00:03:20,352
I was lost between Sadobu and Kadobu.

69
00:03:20,352 --> 00:03:23,352
I lost to the answer to the question,

70
00:03:23,352 --> 00:03:25,352
I can eat sweets in Sadobu.

71
00:03:25,352 --> 00:03:26,352
I see.

72
00:03:26,352 --> 00:03:28,096
Yes.

73
00:03:29,096 --> 00:03:31,096
That's all.

74
00:03:31,096 --> 00:03:36,096
Lastly, please close the camera.

75
00:03:36,096 --> 00:03:40,096
Please come to see us at our live.

76
00:03:40,096 --> 00:03:43,096
This is Amefurashi's one-time love.

77
00:03:43,096 --> 00:03:46,458
Bye-bye.

78
00:03:46,458 --> 00:03:48,958
Oh, you came? Nice to meet you!

79
00:03:48,958 --> 00:03:49,958
I'm so happy!

80
00:03:50,458 --> 00:03:51,458
Huh? Yeah.

81
00:03:51,458 --> 00:03:53,458
Oh, I see. Thank you!

82
00:03:53,458 --> 00:03:54,958
What pose should I do?

83
00:03:54,958 --> 00:03:55,958
Anything is fine.

84
00:03:55,958 --> 00:03:57,958
Ah, let's make a heart together.

85
00:03:57,958 --> 00:03:58,958
Thank you.

86
00:03:58,958 --> 00:03:59,958
Here I go.

87
00:03:59,958 --> 00:04:00,958
Okay, cheese!

88
00:04:01,958 --> 00:04:03,958
Thank you! What's your name?

89
00:04:04,458 --> 00:04:05,458
Oh, yeah.

90
00:04:05,458 --> 00:04:07,458
Oh, really? Thank you!

91
00:04:07,458 --> 00:04:08,958
Second Idol!

92
00:04:08,958 --> 00:04:11,958
This program is brought to you by...

93
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:18,880
Ghi-san

94
00:04:19,880 --> 00:04:21,880
Yuzuki no Toshikatsu-san

95
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:24,880
Mana Cream-san

96
00:04:25,880 --> 00:04:27,880
Itchy-san

97
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:31,880
I was able to deliver them all thanks to
Hiro-san's support.

98
00:04:31,880 --> 00:04:37,081
Thank you for watching!
