1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:12,000
I want to be an idol who can cheer up by
showing the changing appearance to
everyone.

2
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:24,000
I came to Izu, which I wanted to visit.

3
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
Izu! Izu! Izu!

4
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:35,258
Where can I touch it?

5
00:00:35,258 --> 00:00:39,258
There are also other animals such as
pig-toothed hippo and super-looper.

6
00:00:40,258 --> 00:00:41,258
Hello.

7
00:00:41,258 --> 00:00:42,258
Hello.

8
00:00:42,258 --> 00:00:47,258
This is a pet store, but it is a pet
store specializing in reptiles.

9
00:00:47,258 --> 00:00:48,258
Do you like reptiles?

10
00:00:48,258 --> 00:00:49,258
I love them.

11
00:00:49,258 --> 00:00:53,258
I hope you can experience various things
and enjoy them.

12
00:00:53,258 --> 00:00:54,258
Good luck.

13
00:00:54,258 --> 00:01:00,258
Thank you.

14
00:01:01,274 --> 00:01:03,274
Do you know what it is?

15
00:01:03,274 --> 00:01:04,274
There are many small ones.

16
00:01:04,274 --> 00:01:10,274
This is a water tank that contains
reptiles from Madagascar.

17
00:01:10,274 --> 00:01:12,274
It's called a koshagame.

18
00:01:12,274 --> 00:01:15,274
It's a herbivore and loves vegetables.

19
00:01:15,274 --> 00:01:18,274
It's made of Komatsuna, apples, and
carrots.

20
00:01:19,274 --> 00:01:25,274
I was lost in a turtle for an hour when
I was a kid.

21
00:01:25,274 --> 00:01:30,266
I remember that.

22
00:01:30,266 --> 00:01:36,266
I've loved animals since I was a kid.

23
00:01:36,266 --> 00:01:39,266
I've loved them since I was a kid.

24
00:01:42,266 --> 00:01:47,266
I used to play in the corner,

25
00:01:47,266 --> 00:01:58,752
and I used to see bugs or grasshoppers
in the corner.

26
00:01:58,752 --> 00:02:01,752
I was more interested in nature.

27
00:02:01,752 --> 00:02:03,752
I took a water drop near me,

28
00:02:03,752 --> 00:02:10,752
and I showed it to my friend's guardian.

29
00:02:10,752 --> 00:02:12,752
She was surprised.

30
00:02:12,752 --> 00:02:14,752
She was like,

31
00:02:14,752 --> 00:02:16,752
water!

32
00:02:17,752 --> 00:02:19,752
When I was in elementary school,

33
00:02:19,752 --> 00:02:21,752
the people around me

34
00:02:21,752 --> 00:02:26,832
gradually became adults.

35
00:02:26,832 --> 00:02:28,832
I became an adult too.

36
00:02:28,832 --> 00:02:37,832
I couldn't say I liked insects because
everyone was scared of them.

37
00:02:37,832 --> 00:02:40,832
I had no friends.

38
00:02:40,832 --> 00:02:43,832
I didn't have any friends after I became
a child.

39
00:02:43,832 --> 00:02:46,832
I didn't have any friends who could
speak a little.

40
00:02:46,832 --> 00:02:50,832
I didn't have any friends after I became
a child.

41
00:02:50,832 --> 00:02:54,832
I finally had friends after I became a
child.

42
00:02:54,832 --> 00:02:56,256
Everyone...

43
00:02:56,256 --> 00:03:06,256
I'm a girl, so I don't play with bugs or
mud balls.

44
00:03:06,256 --> 00:03:12,256
I think that's why I gradually locked
myself in.

45
00:03:12,256 --> 00:03:20,256
I was the type to get along with others
and care about them.

46
00:03:20,256 --> 00:03:25,008
I wonder if the words at that time were
okay.

47
00:03:25,008 --> 00:03:29,008
I was worried about it later.

48
00:03:34,586 --> 00:03:36,586
Do you know what this is?

49
00:03:36,586 --> 00:03:38,586
URUBER RUBER

50
00:03:38,586 --> 00:03:40,586
It's a catchy name.

51
00:03:40,586 --> 00:03:42,586
It's a Mexican salamander.

52
00:03:46,586 --> 00:03:48,586
It's not a standard salamander.

53
00:03:54,586 --> 00:03:56,586
This is a female salamander.

54
00:03:56,586 --> 00:03:58,586
It's running away.

55
00:03:58,586 --> 00:04:03,504
Sorry.

56
00:04:03,504 --> 00:04:05,264
Cute.

57
00:04:05,264 --> 00:04:09,264
It's slimy.

58
00:04:09,264 --> 00:04:10,264
It's cute.

59
00:04:12,264 --> 00:04:15,024
Please hold it gently.

60
00:04:15,024 --> 00:04:17,264
Please hold it with your arms.

61
00:04:17,264 --> 00:04:18,764
I'll let go.

62
00:04:18,764 --> 00:04:19,764
Wow.

63
00:04:21,764 --> 00:04:22,764
It's heavy.

64
00:04:23,764 --> 00:04:25,764
It's quite heavy.

65
00:04:25,764 --> 00:04:30,764
It's heavy.

66
00:04:32,448 --> 00:04:34,448
Isn't it heavy?

67
00:04:34,448 --> 00:04:36,448
It's heavy.

68
00:04:39,448 --> 00:04:41,448
My nose is running.

69
00:04:44,448 --> 00:04:46,448
It's cute.

70
00:04:46,448 --> 00:04:53,786
Please subscribe to my channel.

71
00:04:53,786 --> 00:04:57,786
I'm going to pick a bunch of vegetables.

72
00:04:59,786 --> 00:05:04,786
I was about to give up on studying.

73
00:05:04,786 --> 00:05:09,786
I was like, I don't care.

74
00:05:10,786 --> 00:05:14,786
I gave up on studying.

75
00:05:14,786 --> 00:05:22,608
I'm not good at memorizing, and I'm slow
at understanding.

76
00:05:22,608 --> 00:05:28,608
I had to work hard to become the best
person, so I was running away from it.

77
00:05:28,608 --> 00:05:37,608
I thought that the world where idols
live was different, so I had no idea
that I would be an idol.

78
00:05:37,608 --> 00:05:45,608
I just thought that I was a fan of
idols.

79
00:05:45,608 --> 00:05:52,368
I didn't want to be an idol when I was
auditioning.

80
00:05:52,368 --> 00:05:56,368
I thought I'd accept it because it was
there.

81
00:05:57,368 --> 00:05:59,368
So I accepted it lightly.

82
00:06:00,368 --> 00:06:05,368
I'm not good at taking pictures, so I
thought I wouldn't pass.

83
00:06:05,368 --> 00:06:08,368
When I forgot, I got a call from the
agency.

84
00:06:08,368 --> 00:06:10,368
I was surprised.

85
00:06:10,368 --> 00:06:14,368
I'm Kishihonoka, 17 years old, from
Tokyo.

86
00:06:14,368 --> 00:06:16,368
Nice to meet you.

87
00:06:16,368 --> 00:06:20,160
I love frogs.

88
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:24,160
I started to change frogs in this
audition period.

89
00:06:27,160 --> 00:06:28,160
This is the frog.

90
00:06:29,160 --> 00:06:36,160
This frog is named Hina-chan,

91
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:38,160
named after Hinata-san of Hinata-zaka46.

92
00:06:39,160 --> 00:06:41,160
Hina-chan lives for 10 years.

93
00:06:41,160 --> 00:06:47,616
If you take care of it, it will live for
20 years.

94
00:06:47,616 --> 00:06:55,616
I want to be loved by everyone for 10 or
20 years with Hina-chan.

95
00:06:55,616 --> 00:06:59,616
Where did you buy the frog?

96
00:06:59,616 --> 00:07:00,616
I bought it yesterday.

97
00:07:00,616 --> 00:07:02,616
Oh, you bought it at the store.

98
00:07:02,616 --> 00:07:03,616
Oh, I see. I'm sorry.

99
00:07:03,616 --> 00:07:05,616
This is Hina-chan.

100
00:07:05,616 --> 00:07:09,616
This is Hina-chan.

101
00:07:09,616 --> 00:07:17,018
Please subscribe to my channel.

102
00:07:17,018 --> 00:07:19,018
I think I can jump.

103
00:07:19,018 --> 00:07:21,018
No!

104
00:07:21,018 --> 00:07:23,018
I couldn't.

105
00:07:23,018 --> 00:07:25,018
Hina wants to jump.

106
00:07:27,018 --> 00:07:29,018
I don't have any special skills.

107
00:07:29,018 --> 00:07:31,018
I didn't have anything to do.

108
00:07:33,018 --> 00:07:35,018
I thought I'd do what I like.

109
00:07:37,018 --> 00:07:39,018
When I thought about what I like,

110
00:07:39,018 --> 00:07:41,018
I made up my mind with this frog.

111
00:07:41,018 --> 00:07:43,018
I said it.

112
00:07:43,018 --> 00:07:46,224
The last scene.

113
00:07:46,224 --> 00:07:50,024
The judges didn't react well.

114
00:07:50,024 --> 00:07:54,224
I was trying to make them laugh.

115
00:07:54,224 --> 00:07:57,624
I thought I was going to fail.

116
00:07:57,624 --> 00:08:00,824
When I heard my name, I said,

117
00:08:00,824 --> 00:08:04,624
I said,

118
00:08:04,624 --> 00:08:08,824
Number 5, Onoka Kishi.

119
00:08:08,824 --> 00:08:15,600
I was confused whether I was really
called or not.

120
00:08:15,600 --> 00:08:17,600
I was really called.

121
00:08:31,600 --> 00:08:33,600
I'm not good at singing and dancing.

122
00:08:34,600 --> 00:08:36,600
I'm slow at remembering things.

123
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:39,600
I'm not good at remembering things.

124
00:08:39,600 --> 00:08:44,112
I think I'm bothering everyone.

125
00:08:44,112 --> 00:08:48,112
I'm worried that I might pull my leg.

126
00:08:48,112 --> 00:09:14,112
I've been practicing all the time.

127
00:09:31,610 --> 00:09:41,610
I'm not good at it, but I think I can do
it.

128
00:09:41,610 --> 00:09:48,610
I'll practice more than anyone else.

129
00:09:48,610 --> 00:09:54,610
If I do my best, I think I can catch up
with other people.

130
00:09:54,610 --> 00:10:00,480
I'm still practicing a lot.

131
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:07,480
I think I have a chance to show it, so
I'm preparing for it.

132
00:10:15,962 --> 00:10:21,962
TEPCO is a Japan entertainment company
affiliated with SOGO ABIL boots and
Aunquebu in Hokkaido.

133
00:10:40,362 --> 00:10:41,018
Please look forward to a performance
video at TEPCO!

134
00:10:41,018 --> 00:10:43,018
I found it!

135
00:10:45,018 --> 00:10:47,018
Is it a thick-toed beaked shadow?

136
00:10:47,018 --> 00:10:49,018
Yes, I know.

137
00:10:51,018 --> 00:10:53,018
I like this one the most.

138
00:10:53,018 --> 00:10:55,018
He is very detailed.

139
00:10:55,018 --> 00:10:57,018
He is popular as a pet.

140
00:10:57,018 --> 00:10:59,018
He is a thick-toed beaked shadow.

141
00:10:59,018 --> 00:11:02,618
Thank you for watching.

142
00:11:02,618 --> 00:11:04,618
Usually, you can't see the name of the
shop by looking at this.

143
00:11:04,618 --> 00:11:06,618
I'll put it on the table and walk over
there.

144
00:11:08,618 --> 00:11:10,618
It's amazing that you can touch it.

145
00:11:10,618 --> 00:11:12,618
Wow, amazing!

146
00:11:12,618 --> 00:11:17,498
I'll put it on my face.

147
00:11:17,498 --> 00:11:19,498
This is tarantula.

148
00:11:19,498 --> 00:11:21,498
It's rare to see this.

149
00:11:21,498 --> 00:11:27,098
Amazing.

150
00:11:27,098 --> 00:11:30,098
I'll wrap it around your body.

151
00:11:32,098 --> 00:11:34,098
I'll do it.

152
00:11:35,098 --> 00:11:36,098
It's heavy.

153
00:11:36,098 --> 00:11:46,106
It's heavy.

154
00:11:46,106 --> 00:11:48,106
It's calm.

155
00:11:48,106 --> 00:11:50,106
Oh, it's cute.

156
00:11:50,106 --> 00:11:52,106
It's 12kg now.

157
00:11:52,106 --> 00:11:54,106
It can't move.

158
00:11:56,106 --> 00:11:58,106
Thank you.

159
00:12:01,106 --> 00:12:03,106
I got it.

160
00:12:03,106 --> 00:12:05,106
It's cute.

161
00:12:13,106 --> 00:12:15,106
I got it.

162
00:12:15,106 --> 00:12:17,106
I got it.

163
00:12:17,106 --> 00:12:22,106
Thank you for watching.

164
00:12:22,682 --> 00:12:31,682
I think I've never found what I wanted
to do, and I've never had a goal in my
life.

165
00:12:32,682 --> 00:12:36,682
I think I'm the one who gave me hope.

166
00:12:36,682 --> 00:12:42,682
I think I'm the one who found the
meaning of life.

167
00:12:42,682 --> 00:12:49,682
I think I'm the one who gave me hope.

168
00:12:50,304 --> 00:12:57,304
God gave me the strength to live a good
life.

169
00:12:57,304 --> 00:13:01,304
I want to be an idol who can show
everyone how I change,

170
00:13:01,304 --> 00:13:06,304
even if I'm not good at anything.

171
00:13:06,304 --> 00:13:21,304
I want to be an idol who gives me
courage and makes me want to do my best.

172
00:13:30,266 --> 00:13:33,766
I'm 18 years old from Tokyo, Kishi
Honoka.
