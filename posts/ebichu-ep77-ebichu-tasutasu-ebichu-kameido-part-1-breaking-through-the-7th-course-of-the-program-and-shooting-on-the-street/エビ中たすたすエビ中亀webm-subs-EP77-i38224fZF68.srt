1
00:00:01,058 --> 00:00:04,058
It's started! Ebi-chuu-tastasu!

2
00:00:07,058 --> 00:00:13,058
This week's Ebi-chuu-tastasu is a
leisurely walk

3
00:00:14,058 --> 00:00:17,058
Everyone is eating!

4
00:00:21,058 --> 00:00:24,058
A private ship is moving

5
00:00:24,058 --> 00:00:29,058
Start with a walk special

6
00:00:29,952 --> 00:00:42,928
Please subscribe to my channel!

7
00:00:42,928 --> 00:00:44,928
I'm so into you

8
00:00:44,928 --> 00:00:49,928
What should I do with my heart?

9
00:00:49,928 --> 00:00:53,928
Monotrium, monotrium, monotrium

10
00:00:53,928 --> 00:00:55,928
Middle school students, monotrium

11
00:00:55,928 --> 00:00:58,928
Add various things to private Ebisu
middle school

12
00:01:00,928 --> 00:01:02,928
Ebisu middle school class

13
00:01:02,928 --> 00:01:06,688
I want to do it

14
00:01:06,688 --> 00:01:11,688
This program is brought to you by these
sponsors.

15
00:01:20,794 --> 00:01:22,794
It's raining

16
00:01:22,794 --> 00:01:24,794
It's raining

17
00:01:24,794 --> 00:01:26,794
Why is it raining at this time?

18
00:01:26,794 --> 00:01:28,794
I wonder

19
00:01:28,794 --> 00:01:32,794
I'm the most curious about this, Hirota

20
00:01:32,794 --> 00:01:38,794
Before we start, there's something we
have to do

21
00:01:38,794 --> 00:01:40,794
What is it?

22
00:01:42,794 --> 00:01:45,794
Here, something has been handed over

23
00:01:47,794 --> 00:01:49,794
Here it is

24
00:01:49,794 --> 00:01:51,794
What is it?

25
00:01:54,586 --> 00:01:57,366
Toots Yummy translates to bizarre

26
00:02:05,242 --> 00:02:09,242
Wait a minute, let's organize the
schedule

27
00:02:09,242 --> 00:02:12,242
What's with the 7th season?

28
00:02:12,242 --> 00:02:16,242
It's the 7th season

29
00:02:16,242 --> 00:02:20,242
It's amazing, we never celebrated it
before

30
00:02:20,242 --> 00:02:24,242
We never celebrated it before, but we
finally celebrated it on the 7th season

31
00:02:24,242 --> 00:02:27,242
7th season is a mid-term show

32
00:02:27,242 --> 00:02:29,242
We've grown up

33
00:02:29,242 --> 00:02:33,242
And, we're going to shoot in the room

34
00:02:33,242 --> 00:02:36,242
Why are we shooting outside?

35
00:02:36,242 --> 00:02:41,242
Today is the special episode of the 7th
season

36
00:02:41,242 --> 00:02:44,242
We're going to shoot at the Kameido

37
00:02:44,242 --> 00:02:47,242
Why Kameido?

38
00:02:47,242 --> 00:02:49,242
It's Kameido

39
00:02:49,242 --> 00:02:55,242
It's been a lot of championships, so I
thought it was dangerous

40
00:02:55,242 --> 00:02:59,242
Badminton was out of balance

41
00:02:59,242 --> 00:03:04,242
We have to fix it

42
00:03:04,242 --> 00:03:06,242
We're going to fix it

43
00:03:06,242 --> 00:03:09,242
Ebichu Tastas started in April last year

44
00:03:09,242 --> 00:03:13,242
It's been a year and a half since the
start

45
00:03:13,242 --> 00:03:16,242
We've challenged various projects

46
00:03:16,242 --> 00:03:24,242
This time, we're going to try something
new

47
00:03:24,242 --> 00:03:31,242
We hope the show will continue

48
00:03:31,242 --> 00:03:37,984
To the Kameido of Gachaoji, Ebichu
Tastas Kameido

49
00:03:37,984 --> 00:03:39,072
Let's move on

50
00:03:39,072 --> 00:03:43,072
So we came to Kameido Umayashiki in
Koto-ku

51
00:03:45,072 --> 00:03:46,072
Kameido Umayashiki

52
00:03:47,072 --> 00:03:49,072
This is not a time slip, is it?

53
00:03:49,072 --> 00:03:51,072
No, it's not

54
00:03:51,072 --> 00:03:52,072
It's not

55
00:03:53,072 --> 00:03:56,072
It's a motif of a house

56
00:03:56,072 --> 00:03:57,072
I see

57
00:03:57,072 --> 00:03:59,072
It's a good place to take a picture

58
00:03:59,072 --> 00:04:00,072
I know

59
00:04:02,072 --> 00:04:03,072
What are we doing today?

60
00:04:03,072 --> 00:04:08,072
This time, we are going to take a walk
in Kameido town

61
00:04:08,072 --> 00:04:11,072
We did it before in the mini-corner

62
00:04:11,072 --> 00:04:13,072
Have you ever been to Kameido?

63
00:04:13,072 --> 00:04:14,072
No

64
00:04:14,072 --> 00:04:15,072
Have you ever been here?

65
00:04:16,072 --> 00:04:17,072
No one has been here?

66
00:04:18,072 --> 00:04:21,072
I've never been here

67
00:04:21,072 --> 00:04:22,072
You've never been here?

68
00:04:22,072 --> 00:04:26,072
Do you know where Kameido is in Tokyo?

69
00:04:27,072 --> 00:04:30,072
For example, if you were in Tokyo

70
00:04:30,072 --> 00:04:31,072
This is Ebisu

71
00:04:31,072 --> 00:04:33,072
Yes, this is Ebisu

72
00:04:33,072 --> 00:04:37,072
There is a mole here

73
00:04:37,072 --> 00:04:40,072
A mole is Ebisu

74
00:04:40,072 --> 00:04:41,072
If a mole is Ebisu

75
00:04:41,072 --> 00:04:42,072
Kameido is...

76
00:04:42,072 --> 00:04:44,072
Which is Saitama, Kaho?

77
00:04:44,072 --> 00:04:45,072
Saitama is...

78
00:04:45,072 --> 00:04:46,072
Is it this way?

79
00:04:48,072 --> 00:04:49,072
Saitama is around here

80
00:04:50,072 --> 00:04:52,072
Saitama is here

81
00:04:52,072 --> 00:04:55,072
So Saitama is below Tokyo?

82
00:04:55,072 --> 00:04:57,072
It's not below?

83
00:04:58,072 --> 00:04:59,072
Saitama is getting lower and lower

84
00:04:59,072 --> 00:05:01,072
Do you know where is above Saitama?

85
00:05:01,072 --> 00:05:03,072
The clouds above Saitama

86
00:05:03,072 --> 00:05:04,072
Oh, I see

87
00:05:04,072 --> 00:05:05,072
You learned it

88
00:05:06,072 --> 00:05:07,072
Where is Ebisu?

89
00:05:07,072 --> 00:05:09,072
Where is Saitama?

90
00:05:09,072 --> 00:05:10,072
It's strange

91
00:05:13,072 --> 00:05:17,072
They can't reach Kameido

92
00:05:17,072 --> 00:05:19,072
So they changed the topic

93
00:05:20,072 --> 00:05:23,072
Hoshina, do you have anything you want
to do in Kameido?

94
00:05:23,072 --> 00:05:26,072
I came to ask Ryo if he is here

95
00:05:26,072 --> 00:05:29,072
Ryo is not here

96
00:05:29,072 --> 00:05:30,072
What's wrong?

97
00:05:30,072 --> 00:05:31,072
That's Kameari

98
00:05:31,072 --> 00:05:32,072
I know

99
00:05:32,072 --> 00:05:35,072
I know it's Kameari

100
00:05:35,072 --> 00:05:37,072
Kame is wrong

101
00:05:37,072 --> 00:05:40,072
What's the most embarrassing thing?

102
00:05:40,072 --> 00:05:42,072
Being caught by Nakayama

103
00:05:42,072 --> 00:05:46,072
It's so embarrassing

104
00:05:46,072 --> 00:05:48,072
We are not in the same line

105
00:05:48,072 --> 00:05:51,072
We are not in the same line

106
00:05:52,072 --> 00:05:54,072
They can't continue talking

107
00:05:54,072 --> 00:05:56,072
So they start walking around Kameido

108
00:05:56,072 --> 00:05:59,072
Before that, they will divide into teams

109
00:05:59,072 --> 00:06:00,072
Team Divide

110
00:06:00,072 --> 00:06:04,072
We will wait for a while

111
00:06:04,072 --> 00:06:06,072
The first team is

112
00:06:06,072 --> 00:06:11,072
Mayama, Hirota, Hoshina, Masuno

113
00:06:11,072 --> 00:06:13,072
Please line up

114
00:06:13,072 --> 00:06:16,072
And the rest is

115
00:06:16,072 --> 00:06:17,072
What's that?

116
00:06:23,072 --> 00:06:28,072
By the way, there is a standard for
dividing this team

117
00:06:28,072 --> 00:06:30,072
It's called car lane

118
00:06:32,072 --> 00:06:35,072
The team that doesn't get drunk and the
team that gets drunk

119
00:06:35,072 --> 00:06:39,072
The car will be divided into two teams

120
00:06:39,072 --> 00:06:40,072
I see

121
00:06:40,072 --> 00:06:42,072
The car that is stable

122
00:06:42,072 --> 00:06:45,072
The car that smells

123
00:06:46,072 --> 00:06:49,072
The smell of the car will be the first
one to be killed

124
00:06:49,072 --> 00:06:52,072
So, the two teams will be divided

125
00:06:52,072 --> 00:06:54,072
The leader will decide first

126
00:06:54,072 --> 00:06:58,072
The leader will decide

127
00:06:59,072 --> 00:07:04,072
So, the team that doesn't get drunk and
the team that gets drunk

128
00:07:04,072 --> 00:07:07,072
They will decide the walking leader

129
00:07:09,072 --> 00:07:11,072
The leader has been decided

130
00:07:11,072 --> 00:07:13,072
The leader of the team that doesn't get
drunk is

131
00:07:13,072 --> 00:07:14,072
Hoshino

132
00:07:14,072 --> 00:07:15,072
Why?

133
00:07:15,072 --> 00:07:17,072
Because she is the most free

134
00:07:17,072 --> 00:07:18,072
Free

135
00:07:18,072 --> 00:07:21,072
I want to go to many places

136
00:07:21,072 --> 00:07:24,072
Good luck

137
00:07:24,072 --> 00:07:26,072
Team 4

138
00:07:26,072 --> 00:07:28,072
Kobayashi

139
00:07:28,072 --> 00:07:30,072
Why is Kobayashi?

140
00:07:30,072 --> 00:07:33,072
Because I get used to the city

141
00:07:33,072 --> 00:07:34,072
You get used to the city?

142
00:07:34,072 --> 00:07:37,072
I think she will look good in a cameo

143
00:07:37,072 --> 00:07:38,072
I see

144
00:07:38,072 --> 00:07:41,072
She will be a cameo girl

145
00:07:42,072 --> 00:07:44,072
The leader has been decided

146
00:07:44,072 --> 00:07:46,072
They are finally leaving

147
00:07:46,072 --> 00:07:50,072
Each team will be divided into the west
and east side of the cameo

148
00:07:50,072 --> 00:07:52,072
They will take a walk in the west

149
00:07:53,946 --> 00:07:57,946
First, they took a walk in a car

150
00:07:57,946 --> 00:08:00,946
They went to a shopping street

151
00:08:01,946 --> 00:08:06,946
They asked what they want to do in this
walk

152
00:08:06,946 --> 00:08:10,946
Let's play tag in the park in the rain

153
00:08:10,946 --> 00:08:11,946
That's good

154
00:08:11,946 --> 00:08:14,946
Ann in Nakayama is usually a bad person

155
00:08:14,946 --> 00:08:16,946
I want to do that

156
00:08:16,946 --> 00:08:18,946
I want to go to a cheap place

157
00:08:18,946 --> 00:08:20,946
Where?

158
00:08:20,946 --> 00:08:22,946
I don't know

159
00:08:22,946 --> 00:08:25,946
I don't know if it's there

160
00:08:25,946 --> 00:08:26,946
I have an image

161
00:08:26,946 --> 00:08:28,946
It might be there

162
00:08:28,946 --> 00:08:30,946
It smells good

163
00:08:32,946 --> 00:08:34,946
Let's go in

164
00:08:34,946 --> 00:08:36,946
It smells good

165
00:08:36,946 --> 00:08:37,946
It smells good

166
00:08:37,946 --> 00:08:39,946
Let's go

167
00:08:39,946 --> 00:08:41,946
Who wants to go?

168
00:08:41,946 --> 00:08:43,946
Let's go

169
00:08:43,946 --> 00:08:50,946
They go in with the smell of freshly
baked bread

170
00:08:53,160 --> 00:08:54,160
It smells good

171
00:08:54,160 --> 00:08:56,160
Wait, the sausage looks good

172
00:08:57,160 --> 00:08:59,160
It's a special curry bread

173
00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:02,160
It's freshly baked

174
00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:07,160
There are many kinds, what do you want
to eat?

175
00:09:07,160 --> 00:09:09,160
I've decided on curry bread

176
00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:11,160
Kashiwagi curry bread

177
00:09:11,160 --> 00:09:12,160
Freshly baked

178
00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:14,160
I'm curious about this

179
00:09:15,160 --> 00:09:17,160
Ham and cheese, croissant

180
00:09:17,160 --> 00:09:18,160
Croissant is here

181
00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:19,160
Among the leaders

182
00:09:19,160 --> 00:09:20,160
Did you choose?

183
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:21,160
I did

184
00:09:21,160 --> 00:09:24,160
Excuse me, do you have any
recommendations?

185
00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:26,160
I thought you wanted to eat the bread

186
00:09:27,160 --> 00:09:31,160
This is the Ancha Batta

187
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:34,160
This Ancha Batta is the first one

188
00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:35,160
Ancha Batta?

189
00:09:35,160 --> 00:09:36,160
What is that?

190
00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:38,160
The most popular one is

191
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:43,160
Ancha Batta with a lot of bean paste in
a soft dough

192
00:09:43,160 --> 00:09:46,272
Yasumoto-san, please try it!

193
00:09:47,272 --> 00:09:48,272
I can't eat red bean

194
00:09:48,272 --> 00:09:50,272
Are you kidding? I asked for your
recommendation

195
00:09:52,272 --> 00:09:55,272
Wait a minute, I can't eat red bean
because you asked for my recommendation

196
00:09:55,272 --> 00:09:58,272
It's popular after Anchan butter

197
00:09:59,272 --> 00:10:00,272
Is there anything?

198
00:10:01,272 --> 00:10:03,272
I want this, I'll try my best

199
00:10:03,272 --> 00:10:05,272
Curry is bitter

200
00:10:05,272 --> 00:10:07,272
I think it's better not to ask

201
00:10:07,272 --> 00:10:08,272
You can't ask

202
00:10:10,272 --> 00:10:11,272
Vegetable?

203
00:10:11,272 --> 00:10:12,272
I like vegetables

204
00:10:12,272 --> 00:10:14,272
That's good, let's buy this

205
00:10:14,272 --> 00:10:15,272
Is it freshly baked?

206
00:10:16,272 --> 00:10:17,272
I'll buy this

207
00:10:17,272 --> 00:10:19,272
Italian vegetables

208
00:10:19,272 --> 00:10:20,272
Italian vegetables

209
00:10:20,272 --> 00:10:21,272
Looks delicious

210
00:10:21,272 --> 00:10:23,272
I'm hungry

211
00:10:23,272 --> 00:10:24,272
I want to eat

212
00:10:24,272 --> 00:10:25,272
Margherita is coming

213
00:10:26,272 --> 00:10:27,272
Margherita is coming

214
00:10:28,272 --> 00:10:29,272
Wait a minute

215
00:10:30,272 --> 00:10:31,272
Margherita is coming

216
00:10:31,272 --> 00:10:32,272
It looks delicious

217
00:10:34,272 --> 00:10:35,272
It's freshly baked

218
00:10:35,272 --> 00:10:37,272
It smells delicious

219
00:10:38,272 --> 00:10:39,272
Let's eat together

220
00:10:39,272 --> 00:10:42,272
Let's buy one and share it

221
00:10:42,272 --> 00:10:43,272
That's good

222
00:10:43,272 --> 00:10:45,272
One and share it

223
00:10:45,272 --> 00:10:52,272
After all, they buy one of their
favorite bread and one of freshly baked
Margherita

224
00:10:52,272 --> 00:10:54,688
Thank you for watching!

225
00:10:55,688 --> 00:11:00,688
It's raining heavily, so let's eat here

226
00:11:00,688 --> 00:11:02,688
You suddenly changed your mind

227
00:11:02,688 --> 00:11:05,688
I'll follow you, Master

228
00:11:05,688 --> 00:11:08,688
Don't be shy, standing side by side

229
00:11:08,688 --> 00:11:12,688
It's like a scene in Totoro, five people
are lined up

230
00:11:12,688 --> 00:11:14,688
It's nice

231
00:11:15,688 --> 00:11:17,688
Let's eat

232
00:11:19,688 --> 00:11:21,688
Where should we start from?

233
00:11:21,688 --> 00:11:23,688
Everyone is eating already

234
00:11:23,688 --> 00:11:25,688
Let's eat

235
00:11:25,688 --> 00:11:27,688
It's delicious

236
00:11:30,688 --> 00:11:32,688
It's crispy

237
00:11:32,688 --> 00:11:34,688
How about you, Yasumoto?

238
00:11:34,688 --> 00:11:36,688
It's delicious

239
00:11:36,688 --> 00:11:40,688
It's spicy and has a strong pepper
flavor

240
00:11:40,688 --> 00:11:42,688
That was a good comment

241
00:11:42,688 --> 00:11:46,688
It's good to have a food report like
that

242
00:11:46,688 --> 00:11:48,688
How about you, Kashiwagi?

243
00:11:48,688 --> 00:11:51,688
It's crispy outside and chewy inside

244
00:11:51,688 --> 00:11:53,688
Are you a food reporter?

245
00:11:53,688 --> 00:11:56,688
I'm talking with curry on my mouth

246
00:11:56,688 --> 00:11:58,688
It's a tea-like taste

247
00:11:58,688 --> 00:12:00,688
It's cute

248
00:12:00,688 --> 00:12:02,688
Next, Nakayama

249
00:12:02,688 --> 00:12:04,688
What is this?

250
00:12:04,688 --> 00:12:06,688
It's like a cake

251
00:12:06,688 --> 00:12:09,688
It's like a chocolate

252
00:12:09,688 --> 00:12:11,688
It's delicious

253
00:12:11,688 --> 00:12:17,688
It's fun to eat from crispy to sweet

254
00:12:17,688 --> 00:12:19,688
It's fun to change the texture

255
00:12:19,688 --> 00:12:21,688
Thank you

256
00:12:21,688 --> 00:12:23,688
How about you, Kobayashi?

257
00:12:23,688 --> 00:12:25,688
Look at this crispy texture

258
00:12:25,688 --> 00:12:29,688
I want to eat it

259
00:12:29,688 --> 00:12:31,688
I ate it already

260
00:12:31,688 --> 00:12:33,688
I'm not good at it

261
00:12:33,688 --> 00:12:35,688
Are you okay?

262
00:12:35,688 --> 00:12:37,688
You made it yourself

263
00:12:37,688 --> 00:12:39,688
Look at this crispy texture

264
00:12:39,688 --> 00:12:41,688
You can't feel the crispiness

265
00:12:41,688 --> 00:12:43,688
Let's eat this

266
00:12:43,688 --> 00:12:45,688
With mayonnaise

267
00:12:45,688 --> 00:12:47,688
It's good

268
00:12:47,688 --> 00:12:49,688
It looks delicious

269
00:12:49,688 --> 00:12:51,688
It's hot

270
00:12:51,688 --> 00:12:53,688
It's like cheese

271
00:12:53,688 --> 00:12:55,688
It's really hot

272
00:12:55,688 --> 00:12:57,688
It's good

273
00:12:57,688 --> 00:12:59,688
Yasumoto, everyone wants to eat it

274
00:12:59,688 --> 00:13:01,688
Don't eat it

275
00:13:01,688 --> 00:13:03,688
Don't eat it

276
00:13:03,688 --> 00:13:05,688
Yasumoto, everyone wants to eat it

277
00:13:05,688 --> 00:13:07,688
You're eating Kashiwagi

278
00:13:07,688 --> 00:13:09,688
Nakayama started eating it

279
00:13:09,688 --> 00:13:13,688
Yasumoto, let everyone eat it

280
00:13:13,688 --> 00:13:17,688
Don't eat it

281
00:13:17,688 --> 00:13:19,688
Don't eat it

282
00:13:19,688 --> 00:13:21,688
Don't eat it

283
00:13:21,688 --> 00:13:23,688
Everyone wants to eat it

284
00:13:23,688 --> 00:13:27,688
Don't say that you don't know the taste

285
00:13:27,688 --> 00:13:33,648
Thank you for watching! Please subscribe
our channel!

286
00:13:34,648 --> 00:13:38,648
Kobayashi-san, the leader of the
walkway, found something

287
00:13:39,648 --> 00:13:42,648
It says recycling, so it's a very cheap
shop

288
00:13:42,648 --> 00:13:44,648
We have to go!

289
00:13:44,648 --> 00:13:46,648
I think my dream will come true

290
00:13:46,648 --> 00:13:48,648
Let's go!

291
00:13:48,648 --> 00:13:50,648
Let's go!

292
00:13:50,648 --> 00:13:52,648
Cheap shopping is the best!

293
00:13:52,648 --> 00:13:53,648
Thank you!

294
00:13:53,648 --> 00:13:55,648
I can see the price of 105 yen

295
00:13:55,648 --> 00:13:57,648
105 yen?

296
00:13:57,648 --> 00:13:59,648
Isn't it great?

297
00:13:59,648 --> 00:14:00,648
It's very cheap

298
00:14:00,648 --> 00:14:03,648
Before we go inside, we should get
permission from the leader

299
00:14:03,648 --> 00:14:05,648
Please go inside

300
00:14:05,648 --> 00:14:07,648
I'll go inside

301
00:14:09,344 --> 00:14:11,344
Excuse me

302
00:14:11,344 --> 00:14:16,344
This is a program called Ebitu Tastas

303
00:14:16,344 --> 00:14:17,344
This is...

304
00:14:17,344 --> 00:14:18,344
Where do you want to go?

305
00:14:18,344 --> 00:14:21,344
Let's go to the next station

306
00:14:21,344 --> 00:14:23,344
Let's go

307
00:14:23,344 --> 00:14:25,344
There might be something over there

308
00:14:25,344 --> 00:14:27,344
There's a cake

309
00:14:27,344 --> 00:14:28,344
Looks delicious

310
00:14:28,344 --> 00:14:30,344
There are so many good things

311
00:14:30,344 --> 00:14:31,344
Happy birthday

312
00:14:31,344 --> 00:14:33,344
Hey, hey, hey

313
00:14:33,344 --> 00:14:35,344
I got permission

314
00:14:35,344 --> 00:14:37,344
Why are you trying to go without
permission?

315
00:14:37,344 --> 00:14:39,344
I was surprised

316
00:14:39,344 --> 00:14:41,344
That was good

317
00:14:41,344 --> 00:14:45,344
I forgot about the rain and came here

318
00:14:45,344 --> 00:14:48,344
Let's go inside

319
00:14:48,344 --> 00:14:50,344
Let's go

320
00:14:50,344 --> 00:15:00,344
This is a fashion shop with 17 stores in
Chiba and Tokyo

321
00:15:01,248 --> 00:15:05,248
They sell cheap items for only 105 yen

322
00:15:06,704 --> 00:15:10,204
Yasumoto, you wanted to come to a cheap
place, right?

323
00:15:10,204 --> 00:15:11,204
I wanted to come

324
00:15:11,204 --> 00:15:13,204
How is it? It's actually cheap

325
00:15:13,204 --> 00:15:16,704
It's cheaper than I expected, I'm
surprised

326
00:15:16,704 --> 00:15:21,704
Since it's cheap, let's do a matching
battle

327
00:15:21,704 --> 00:15:23,704
Matching?

328
00:15:23,704 --> 00:15:24,704
It's 105 yen for a coat

329
00:15:24,704 --> 00:15:25,704
Cheap

330
00:15:25,704 --> 00:15:27,704
It's not like this

331
00:15:29,704 --> 00:15:31,704
Face the camera again

332
00:15:31,704 --> 00:15:32,704
It's not like this

333
00:15:32,704 --> 00:15:33,704
Okay, let's buy it

334
00:15:33,704 --> 00:15:36,704
Do you want to be filmed?

335
00:15:37,704 --> 00:15:39,704
Let's start the matching battle

336
00:15:39,704 --> 00:15:41,704
Ready, start!

337
00:15:43,704 --> 00:15:47,704
It seems that the matching battle has
started

338
00:15:47,704 --> 00:15:48,704
It's a coat bag

339
00:15:48,704 --> 00:15:49,704
It's cute

340
00:15:49,704 --> 00:15:50,704
It's a coat bag

341
00:15:50,704 --> 00:15:52,704
Should we think about the season?

342
00:15:52,704 --> 00:15:53,704
Yes, we should

343
00:15:55,704 --> 00:15:57,704
Ayaka-chan, you didn't wear this

344
00:15:57,704 --> 00:15:58,704
This dress

345
00:15:58,704 --> 00:15:59,704
I didn't wear it

346
00:15:59,704 --> 00:16:00,704
It's cute

347
00:16:00,704 --> 00:16:02,704
Yasumoto, you bought it here?

348
00:16:02,704 --> 00:16:04,704
It's my first time wearing it

349
00:16:04,704 --> 00:16:05,704
This dress is cute

350
00:16:05,704 --> 00:16:06,704
Let's look for it

351
00:16:06,704 --> 00:16:08,704
Let's take a picture of it on our blog

352
00:16:09,704 --> 00:16:12,704
Wait, you're pretending to be a regular
customer

353
00:16:12,704 --> 00:16:13,664
Please subscribe to our channel!

354
00:16:14,664 --> 00:16:15,664
It's my first time

355
00:16:18,164 --> 00:16:19,164
But

356
00:16:21,664 --> 00:16:24,664
Wait, I have this!

357
00:16:26,164 --> 00:16:28,164
I found the clothes I have!

358
00:16:28,164 --> 00:16:29,808
Honey! Honey!

359
00:16:30,808 --> 00:16:31,808
Furthermore

360
00:16:32,808 --> 00:16:33,808
I have this too!

361
00:16:35,808 --> 00:16:37,808
Why do you have that?

362
00:16:37,808 --> 00:16:39,808
I have this too!

363
00:16:39,808 --> 00:16:41,808
Is it really the same one?

364
00:16:41,808 --> 00:16:42,808
It's the same one!

365
00:16:43,808 --> 00:16:45,808
Then, it's a regular item!

366
00:16:45,808 --> 00:16:46,808
It was this tag!

367
00:16:48,808 --> 00:16:52,808
As expected, it was a regular item of
Tanpopo House, Yasumoto-san

368
00:16:52,808 --> 00:16:54,808
Why?

369
00:16:56,128 --> 00:17:00,128
After this, the members will be shown in
their cheap outfits.

370
00:17:00,128 --> 00:17:02,128
The winner will be decided.

371
00:17:05,128 --> 00:17:10,128
The cheap outfits battle that started at
a fashion recycle shop.

372
00:17:10,128 --> 00:17:15,128
It seems like the shopping is over, so
we'll announce the coordinates.

373
00:17:15,128 --> 00:17:22,000
First, Kobayashi-san, the walking
leader.

374
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:24,000
Kobayashi-san, please.

375
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:34,000
Thank you.

376
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:34,880
The theme is...

377
00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:38,080
The theme is a girl who looks like she's
in Kameido.

378
00:17:38,080 --> 00:17:40,080
A girl who looks like she's in Kameido?

379
00:17:40,080 --> 00:17:40,880
Yes.

380
00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:42,480
By the way, what kind of image do you
have of Kameido?

381
00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:43,880
Kameido is...

382
00:17:43,880 --> 00:17:45,280
It's like this.

383
00:17:45,280 --> 00:17:47,880
It's like you're going to hit the
patterns?

384
00:17:47,880 --> 00:17:49,880
I see.

385
00:17:49,880 --> 00:17:52,680
I'm not sure what Kameido is like at
all.

386
00:17:52,680 --> 00:17:53,880
But Kobayashi-san!

387
00:17:53,880 --> 00:17:54,480
Yes?

388
00:17:54,480 --> 00:17:55,880
The total price is...

389
00:17:55,880 --> 00:17:56,880
Yes?

390
00:17:56,880 --> 00:17:58,880
420 yen!

391
00:17:58,880 --> 00:18:01,880
No, it's not like we're doing a
competition or anything.

392
00:18:01,880 --> 00:18:02,880
Huh?

393
00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:05,880
It's not a competition, but 420 yen is
amazing.

394
00:18:05,880 --> 00:18:06,880
Isn't it amazing?

395
00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:08,880
How is it? Are you confident that you'll
win?

396
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:11,880
I want to win against my teacher.

397
00:18:11,880 --> 00:18:13,880
You're all very conscious of Yasumoto.

398
00:18:13,880 --> 00:18:14,880
I'm a fashion leader.

399
00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:16,880
What about Yasumoto? Is he good at
fashion?

400
00:18:16,880 --> 00:18:18,880
He's good. He's really good.

401
00:18:18,880 --> 00:18:19,880
Please be quiet.

402
00:18:19,880 --> 00:18:21,880
Don't say it yourself.

403
00:18:21,880 --> 00:18:23,880
We're listening to you.

404
00:18:23,880 --> 00:18:27,880
He has a similar style to me.

405
00:18:27,880 --> 00:18:29,880
You have a similar style to him.

406
00:18:29,880 --> 00:18:31,880
Does Yasumoto like Kobayashi's style?

407
00:18:31,880 --> 00:18:34,880
No, no, I can't see the answer.

408
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:36,880
You can't see the answer?

409
00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:43,968
Next, Kashiwagi-san's lecture.

410
00:18:43,968 --> 00:18:45,968
Here we go!

411
00:18:54,362 --> 00:18:56,362
Thank you very much.

412
00:18:57,362 --> 00:18:59,362
You all make the sound by yourselves,
right?

413
00:18:59,362 --> 00:19:00,362
I thought it would be better to say it.

414
00:19:00,362 --> 00:19:01,362
You are silent.

415
00:19:01,362 --> 00:19:02,362
Yes, I am silent.

416
00:19:03,362 --> 00:19:05,362
What is the theme of the rental car?

417
00:19:05,362 --> 00:19:06,362
Co-operation.

418
00:19:06,362 --> 00:19:07,362
Co-operation.

419
00:19:07,362 --> 00:19:08,362
What do you mean?

420
00:19:08,362 --> 00:19:09,362
I chose it at first.

421
00:19:09,362 --> 00:19:10,362
I came here once.

422
00:19:10,362 --> 00:19:15,362
It was hard to find a place that fits
here.

423
00:19:15,362 --> 00:19:19,362
So, my manager chose various things for
me.

424
00:19:19,362 --> 00:19:21,362
So, it's a little different from the one
you chose at first.

425
00:19:21,362 --> 00:19:22,362
It's different.

426
00:19:22,362 --> 00:19:24,362
So, it's a co-operation with your
manager?

427
00:19:24,362 --> 00:19:26,362
Yes, I'm almost a manager.

428
00:19:26,362 --> 00:19:27,362
Really?

429
00:19:27,362 --> 00:19:28,362
So, you didn't choose a rental car.

430
00:19:28,362 --> 00:19:29,362
But I chose it.

431
00:19:29,362 --> 00:19:30,362
Really?

432
00:19:30,362 --> 00:19:33,362
Yasumoto is also good at fashion.

433
00:19:33,362 --> 00:19:35,362
So, I don't want to lose to him.

434
00:19:35,362 --> 00:19:36,362
I don't want to lose to Yasumoto.

435
00:19:36,362 --> 00:19:38,362
Is Yasumoto good at fashion?

436
00:19:38,362 --> 00:19:40,362
Yes, he is.

437
00:19:40,362 --> 00:19:48,192
Yasumoto is good at fashion.

438
00:19:48,192 --> 00:19:51,192
Here comes Yasumoto!

439
00:19:59,290 --> 00:20:01,290
What's the theme of this?

440
00:20:01,290 --> 00:20:03,290
The theme is the feeling of the season

441
00:20:03,290 --> 00:20:04,290
The feeling of the season?

442
00:20:04,290 --> 00:20:05,290
No, nothing

443
00:20:06,632 --> 00:20:07,632
I took the winter first

444
00:20:07,632 --> 00:20:09,632
You took the winter first, because it's
still October

445
00:20:10,632 --> 00:20:11,632
It's a little hot

446
00:20:11,632 --> 00:20:12,632
It's a little hot, isn't it?

447
00:20:12,632 --> 00:20:13,632
Yes, it is

448
00:20:13,632 --> 00:20:16,632
How do you actually wear it?

449
00:20:16,632 --> 00:20:17,632
Oh, yes

450
00:20:17,632 --> 00:20:18,632
In the summer

451
00:20:18,632 --> 00:20:21,632
No, in the winter, it's like this

452
00:20:21,632 --> 00:20:23,632
It doesn't change much

453
00:20:23,632 --> 00:20:24,632
Oh, really?

454
00:20:24,632 --> 00:20:26,632
Because it's a regular fashion here

455
00:20:26,632 --> 00:20:29,632
I had a lot of clothes I had

456
00:20:31,640 --> 00:20:35,640
And finally, Nakayama-san's outfit

457
00:20:36,640 --> 00:20:38,640
Here is Nakayama-san, please

458
00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:51,640
Here you are

459
00:20:51,640 --> 00:20:52,640
Me?

460
00:20:52,640 --> 00:20:53,640
This?

461
00:20:53,640 --> 00:20:54,640
It was a set, 3 sets

462
00:20:54,640 --> 00:20:56,640
Since you have some left, let's make it
a set

463
00:20:56,640 --> 00:20:58,640
You gave me the rest

464
00:20:58,640 --> 00:21:00,000
Oh, good

465
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:02,000
It's perfect

466
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:03,834
Let's go with this all the time

467
00:21:03,834 --> 00:21:05,834
What's the theme of this?

468
00:21:05,834 --> 00:21:07,834
Well, Halloween

469
00:21:07,834 --> 00:21:09,834
I see

470
00:21:09,834 --> 00:21:13,834
I decided on this at the very beginning

471
00:21:13,834 --> 00:21:15,834
I decided on this

472
00:21:15,834 --> 00:21:17,834
You started from here

473
00:21:17,834 --> 00:21:20,834
I started and chose clothes

474
00:21:20,834 --> 00:21:23,834
I thought this is my true self

475
00:21:23,834 --> 00:21:26,834
So, you matched the color of this and
the T-shirt?

476
00:21:26,834 --> 00:21:27,834
Yes, I did

477
00:21:27,834 --> 00:21:29,834
I started from the top

478
00:21:29,834 --> 00:21:31,834
You decided from the top

479
00:21:31,834 --> 00:21:34,834
Wow, I'm getting bored of this

480
00:21:34,834 --> 00:21:37,834
I thought it's embarrassing

481
00:21:37,834 --> 00:21:38,834
I chose it myself

482
00:21:38,834 --> 00:21:44,834
After seeing everyone's outfits, they
decided to win

483
00:21:44,834 --> 00:21:46,834
Let's go!

484
00:21:47,584 --> 00:21:49,584
Dome!

485
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:56,720
Yasumoto 2, Kakayama 1, Chuuei 1

486
00:21:56,720 --> 00:22:00,720
The winner is Yasumoto!

487
00:22:02,720 --> 00:22:04,720
Wow, amazing

488
00:22:04,720 --> 00:22:06,720
How is it, fashion leader?

489
00:22:06,720 --> 00:22:09,720
You suddenly became arrogant

490
00:22:10,720 --> 00:22:13,720
I made a big mistake

491
00:22:13,720 --> 00:22:17,720
I'm over 1,000 yen, even though it's so
cheap

492
00:22:17,720 --> 00:22:21,720
It's almost 2,000 yen

493
00:22:21,720 --> 00:22:24,720
You spent a lot of money, so you are the
winner

494
00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:26,720
I'm going to win without any complaints

495
00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:29,720
You are the winner, after spending so
much money

496
00:22:29,720 --> 00:22:32,720
You are saying such a humble thing, but
your face looks happy

497
00:22:32,720 --> 00:22:35,720
I'll be on the show

498
00:22:35,720 --> 00:22:41,008
After enjoying cheap shopping

499
00:22:41,008 --> 00:22:45,608
once again make aияium?

500
00:22:46,776 --> 00:22:48,776
This time the fashion show was very
exciting

501
00:22:51,776 --> 00:22:53,776
Here, Kashiwagi-san

502
00:22:54,776 --> 00:22:56,776
Hey, there's a bun cha, let's eat it

503
00:22:56,776 --> 00:22:57,776
Really?

504
00:22:57,776 --> 00:22:58,776
There is

505
00:22:58,776 --> 00:22:59,776
It's true

506
00:22:59,776 --> 00:23:00,776
Where?

507
00:23:00,776 --> 00:23:01,776
There it is

508
00:23:01,776 --> 00:23:02,776
Turtle

509
00:23:02,776 --> 00:23:03,776
Turtle?

510
00:23:03,776 --> 00:23:05,776
Kashiwagi-san, you're fast at finding it

511
00:23:06,776 --> 00:23:07,776
Why is it a turtle?

512
00:23:08,776 --> 00:23:09,776
Turtle?

513
00:23:09,776 --> 00:23:10,776
Turtle?

514
00:23:10,776 --> 00:23:12,776
Is it a mark of a turtle?

515
00:23:12,776 --> 00:23:19,760
Turtle

516
00:23:19,760 --> 00:23:21,760
Let's go!

517
00:23:21,760 --> 00:23:23,760
Thank you very much

518
00:23:23,760 --> 00:23:25,760
Sorry

519
00:23:25,760 --> 00:23:29,760
Monja's shop is only for Kameido

520
00:23:29,760 --> 00:23:32,760
Let's do that first

521
00:23:32,760 --> 00:23:34,760
I'll leave it to you, leader

522
00:23:34,760 --> 00:23:35,760
Let's go

523
00:23:35,760 --> 00:23:37,760
Can I ask?

524
00:23:37,760 --> 00:23:39,760
Ask, ask

525
00:23:39,760 --> 00:23:41,760
Can you get my appo?

526
00:23:41,760 --> 00:23:42,760
Be careful

527
00:23:42,760 --> 00:23:44,760
Thank you, Kobayashi

528
00:23:44,760 --> 00:23:46,760
Good luck

529
00:23:46,760 --> 00:23:48,752
I'll be waiting

530
00:23:48,752 --> 00:23:49,752
It's okay

531
00:23:49,752 --> 00:23:50,752
Okay

532
00:23:50,752 --> 00:23:51,752
Yes

533
00:23:51,752 --> 00:23:52,752
See you

534
00:23:52,752 --> 00:23:53,752
I'm here

535
00:23:53,752 --> 00:23:54,752
I'm here

536
00:23:54,752 --> 00:23:55,752
It's okay

537
00:23:55,752 --> 00:23:56,752
Bye bye

538
00:23:56,752 --> 00:23:56,960
Bye bye

539
00:23:56,960 --> 00:23:59,960
Excuse me, can I have a MQ?

540
00:23:59,960 --> 00:24:01,960
Let's go

541
00:24:01,960 --> 00:24:02,960
Where should we go?

542
00:24:02,960 --> 00:24:04,960
How about an electric store?

543
00:24:04,960 --> 00:24:05,960
That's a good idea

544
00:24:05,960 --> 00:24:08,960
We'll go to an electric store and ask
where we are going

545
00:24:09,960 --> 00:24:11,960
It's a shopping street, so there are
many things to do

546
00:24:13,960 --> 00:24:15,960
This is my second time today

547
00:24:15,960 --> 00:24:16,960
Sorry, Kobayashi

548
00:24:16,960 --> 00:24:19,960
I couldn't hear you because of the sound
of the truck

549
00:24:21,960 --> 00:24:22,960
We got the information

550
00:24:22,960 --> 00:24:24,960
Let's go

551
00:24:26,960 --> 00:24:30,960
Next episode is the second part of the
MQ

552
00:24:32,960 --> 00:24:37,960
Nakayama and Kashiwagi are showing their
special skills at the store

553
00:24:39,960 --> 00:24:41,960
Kashiwagi is already out

554
00:24:45,960 --> 00:24:48,960
This team is also taking a walk

555
00:24:48,960 --> 00:24:50,960
Ouch!

556
00:24:50,960 --> 00:24:53,960
This is painful!

557
00:24:56,000 --> 00:25:02,000
This program is brought to you by the
following sponsors.
