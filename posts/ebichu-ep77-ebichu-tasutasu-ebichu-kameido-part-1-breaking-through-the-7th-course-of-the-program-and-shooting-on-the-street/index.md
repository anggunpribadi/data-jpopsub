Today's daily duty: Aika Hirota
Program purpose: Let's add "various things" to the idol group Shiritsu Ebisu Chugaku! Such a throwing experimental program "Ebichu ++ (Tasutasu)" has started! !
Shrimp medium + tissue, shrimp medium + curry, shrimp medium + Indian... Ebichu members collaborated on something and verified the results!
A variety show that unpredictably unfolds every time.
Also, in the program, we will introduce the activities of Ebichu research student "Sakura Ebi-zu"!
In addition, a game project in Shrimp was launched. What will be born from the collaboration between Ebichu and the game? ?

Program content: In October, Ebichu ++ enters its 7th course! As a celebration, the place I visited was "Kameido". Ebichu members and shooting stars walk around Kameido with the hope that the program will continue for a long time, following the longevity of the turtle. Divided into Team Yasumoto, Kashiwagi, Kobayashi, and Nakayama and Team Mayama, Hirota, Hoshina, and Matsuno, they decided to wander around freely. The Yasumoto team is having a blast at the bakery that they somehow entered. Furthermore, at a super-discount thrift store that Yasumoto enters on his own, for some reason, a coordination battle begins, and the members buy up clothes on their own themes. A special edition that delivers a more private feeling than usual.
