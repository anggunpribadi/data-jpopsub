1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Ebitune's videos!

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,000
I'm the 10th, GINATO KASHIWA.

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:13,000
Today, I'm going to show you my Rubik's
Cube!

4
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:18,000
It's been a while since I've done this.

5
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:23,000
I did this at home last time, around
June.

6
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:28,208
But I was too excited to turn it around,
so I couldn't get it right.

7
00:00:28,208 --> 00:00:31,208
So I haven't touched it in a while.

8
00:00:31,208 --> 00:00:36,208
This is the normal one.

9
00:00:36,208 --> 00:00:38,208
I want to try it.

10
00:00:38,208 --> 00:00:40,208
I don't know if I can do it.

11
00:00:40,208 --> 00:00:42,208
Let's see.

12
00:00:42,208 --> 00:00:46,208
I'll have Su-yu mess it up.

13
00:00:46,208 --> 00:00:48,208
I'm scared.

14
00:00:48,208 --> 00:00:50,208
I wonder if I can do it.

15
00:00:50,208 --> 00:00:52,208
I'm scared.

16
00:00:52,208 --> 00:00:57,872
It's hard.

17
00:00:57,872 --> 00:01:01,872
There were many ways to do it.

18
00:01:01,872 --> 00:01:05,872
I messed up the colors.

19
00:01:05,872 --> 00:01:07,872
I had all the six faces.

20
00:01:07,872 --> 00:01:10,872
I'll try it now.

21
00:01:10,872 --> 00:01:13,872
First, I have to make a flower.

22
00:01:15,872 --> 00:01:18,872
I don't remember this part.

23
00:01:18,872 --> 00:01:24,872
I'll put it there.

24
00:01:27,642 --> 00:01:29,642
What should I do from here?

25
00:01:35,642 --> 00:01:36,642
What?

26
00:01:37,642 --> 00:01:38,642
It's not right?

27
00:01:38,642 --> 00:01:39,642
Wait wait wait

28
00:01:40,642 --> 00:01:44,642
I have to put it back

29
00:01:44,642 --> 00:01:52,698
I want to put this here

30
00:01:52,698 --> 00:01:54,238
Down.

31
00:01:58,522 --> 00:02:00,522
What?

32
00:02:04,422 --> 00:02:05,642
What?

33
00:02:05,642 --> 00:02:06,902
llegend good

34
00:02:06,902 --> 00:02:07,682
Good

35
00:02:07,682 --> 00:02:08,702
That's good

36
00:02:08,702 --> 00:02:10,402
yun هي

37
00:02:10,902 --> 00:02:12,902
Somehow

38
00:02:15,402 --> 00:02:17,402
13

39
00:02:27,482 --> 00:02:30,482
I remember now.

40
00:02:30,482 --> 00:02:32,482
What?

41
00:02:32,482 --> 00:02:34,482
I can't remember.

42
00:02:37,482 --> 00:02:38,482
What?

43
00:02:38,482 --> 00:02:39,482
Wait.

44
00:02:39,482 --> 00:02:41,482
Everything is different.

45
00:02:41,482 --> 00:02:44,482
Everything is different.

46
00:02:44,482 --> 00:02:46,482
What is this?

47
00:02:50,482 --> 00:02:52,482
Why?

48
00:02:52,482 --> 00:02:53,360
What?

49
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:55,360
Look!

50
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:57,360
They are all different.

51
00:02:57,360 --> 00:03:01,360
I've just encountered a new one.

52
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:04,360
Anyway, let's fix it.

53
00:03:08,360 --> 00:03:10,360
Why?

54
00:03:10,360 --> 00:03:12,360
It should be okay.

55
00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:19,360
I've never seen four sides so
beautifully different even when I did it
in June.

56
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:23,200
I've broken it more.

57
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:26,200
I've broken it more.

58
00:03:26,200 --> 00:03:32,288
I've broken it more.

59
00:03:32,288 --> 00:03:33,768
Wait a minute.

60
00:03:33,768 --> 00:03:35,848
Why is this happening?

61
00:03:35,848 --> 00:03:38,848
I've already broken a beautiful surface.

62
00:03:38,848 --> 00:03:42,128
I'll fix it as soon as possible.

63
00:03:43,128 --> 00:03:44,688
I'll fix it as soon as possible.

64
00:03:44,688 --> 00:03:47,688
I want to go back to myself.

65
00:03:48,568 --> 00:03:53,288
I wanted to do it quickly.

66
00:03:53,288 --> 00:04:01,288
This is strange.

67
00:04:01,328 --> 00:04:03,328
What's wrong?

68
00:04:03,328 --> 00:04:05,328
Why are you doing this?

69
00:04:05,328 --> 00:04:07,328
Why?

70
00:04:07,328 --> 00:04:09,328
Why?

71
00:04:12,328 --> 00:04:14,328
I did it.

72
00:04:16,328 --> 00:04:18,328
I'm kidding.

73
00:04:18,328 --> 00:04:20,328
Wait a minute.

74
00:04:20,328 --> 00:04:23,328
I'm going to get my mind back.

75
00:04:25,328 --> 00:04:27,328
I'm going to have fun.

76
00:04:27,328 --> 00:04:31,328
I'm asking you why.

77
00:04:31,888 --> 00:04:33,888
You hate me.

78
00:04:33,888 --> 00:04:35,888
I'm doing that.

79
00:04:43,888 --> 00:04:45,888
I can do it.

80
00:04:45,888 --> 00:04:47,888
I did that much.

81
00:04:47,888 --> 00:04:50,888
I did that much and I was able to do it
that quickly.

82
00:04:50,888 --> 00:04:54,016
I can do it.

83
00:04:54,016 --> 00:04:56,016
It's already done.

84
00:04:56,016 --> 00:04:58,016
It's fast, isn't it?

85
00:04:58,016 --> 00:05:00,016
Okay, it's done.

86
00:05:00,016 --> 00:05:02,016
The problem starts from here.

87
00:05:02,016 --> 00:05:13,434
What's wrong?

88
00:05:13,434 --> 00:05:15,434
I'm back!

89
00:05:15,434 --> 00:05:17,434
What did I do?

90
00:05:17,434 --> 00:05:19,434
I'm back

91
00:05:19,434 --> 00:05:21,434
I got them all

92
00:05:23,434 --> 00:05:25,434
They all came out

93
00:05:25,434 --> 00:05:27,434
I wonder if I used magic

94
00:05:27,434 --> 00:05:29,434
I wonder why

95
00:05:29,434 --> 00:05:31,434
Why did I get them all?

96
00:05:31,434 --> 00:05:35,744
I wonder why

97
00:05:35,744 --> 00:05:44,184
I thought I could do it if I did
something in the middle of the video

98
00:05:45,344 --> 00:05:52,664
I thought it was over

99
00:05:52,664 --> 00:05:57,504
I can do it! I can do it! I can do it!

100
00:05:57,504 --> 00:06:02,544
I can do it!

101
00:06:02,544 --> 00:06:08,544
I'm glad I believed in you!

102
00:06:08,544 --> 00:06:11,544
I did it!

103
00:06:11,544 --> 00:06:13,544
I finally did it!

104
00:06:15,544 --> 00:06:18,544
I'm going to cry because I'm so moved.

105
00:06:18,544 --> 00:06:23,696
I'm not going to cry, but I'm happy.

106
00:06:23,696 --> 00:06:25,696
I'm tired.

107
00:06:25,696 --> 00:06:29,696
This is the main subject.

108
00:06:29,696 --> 00:06:35,696
There's a new RUIKU cube.

109
00:06:35,696 --> 00:06:40,696
I haven't seen it yet, so I don't know
what's coming.

110
00:06:40,696 --> 00:06:43,696
I'm going to look around.

111
00:06:43,696 --> 00:06:45,696
Open!

112
00:06:45,696 --> 00:06:47,696
What?

113
00:06:47,696 --> 00:06:49,696
What is this?

114
00:06:49,696 --> 00:06:52,256
Four?

115
00:06:52,256 --> 00:06:55,256
I've never seen this before.

116
00:06:55,256 --> 00:06:56,256
It's cute.

117
00:06:56,256 --> 00:06:59,256
It's easy to shake.

118
00:06:59,256 --> 00:07:08,346
How do you do this?

119
00:07:08,346 --> 00:07:10,346
I did it.

120
00:07:12,634 --> 00:07:14,634
I got the color.

121
00:07:14,634 --> 00:07:16,634
But...

122
00:07:16,634 --> 00:07:21,634
From November 12th to 22nd,

123
00:07:21,634 --> 00:07:27,634
I was invited to the Elf the Musical.

124
00:07:27,634 --> 00:07:29,634
I touched the green.

125
00:07:29,634 --> 00:07:35,634
I was invited to the Elf the Musical.

126
00:07:35,634 --> 00:07:37,634
I finished it safely.

127
00:07:37,634 --> 00:07:39,634
Thank you for coming.

128
00:07:39,634 --> 00:07:43,634
It's a story of early Christmas.

129
00:07:43,634 --> 00:07:48,634
Because of the corona,

130
00:07:48,634 --> 00:07:50,634
there were live performances with
guests.

131
00:07:50,634 --> 00:07:53,634
There was a mid-tone and a birthday
party.

132
00:07:53,634 --> 00:07:56,634
The musical and the play...

133
00:07:56,634 --> 00:07:59,634
I don't know the current situation.

134
00:07:59,634 --> 00:08:01,634
It was just around the corner.

135
00:08:01,634 --> 00:08:03,634
I filled up the space.

136
00:08:03,634 --> 00:08:08,634
I sat in a full seat.

137
00:08:08,634 --> 00:08:12,634
Since the February fan club event,

138
00:08:12,634 --> 00:08:16,634
I didn't have enough seats.

139
00:08:16,634 --> 00:08:19,634
I filled up the whole space.

140
00:08:19,634 --> 00:08:22,634
I saw that scene for the first time in a
long time.

141
00:08:22,634 --> 00:08:26,912
I almost cried on the first day.

142
00:08:26,912 --> 00:08:28,912
I was moved.

143
00:08:28,912 --> 00:08:30,912
Just by that.

144
00:08:30,912 --> 00:08:33,216
It was hard.

145
00:08:33,216 --> 00:08:36,216
It was so much fun and it was so
fulfilling.

146
00:08:36,216 --> 00:08:38,216
But...

147
00:08:38,216 --> 00:08:42,216
There was no manager at the set.

148
00:08:42,216 --> 00:08:45,216
I was really alone.

149
00:08:45,216 --> 00:08:49,216
I've been on stage and in dramas before.

150
00:08:49,216 --> 00:08:54,216
I've done it alone a few times.

151
00:08:54,216 --> 00:08:56,216
But...

152
00:08:56,216 --> 00:09:01,216
There was someone I knew.

153
00:09:01,216 --> 00:09:06,216
I've done it with my co-star.

154
00:09:07,168 --> 00:09:12,168
I don't know anyone.

155
00:09:17,168 --> 00:09:21,168
I've been nervous all the time.

156
00:09:21,168 --> 00:09:26,168
Everyone thought I was a quiet girl.

157
00:09:26,168 --> 00:09:28,168
I'm a quiet girl.

158
00:09:28,168 --> 00:09:33,600
But I'm not a quiet girl.

159
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:36,160
You're all grown-ups.

160
00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:41,080
If I suddenly start something weird in
front of you,

161
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:44,400
you'll be like, what's wrong with you?

162
00:09:44,400 --> 00:09:50,896
You're not the type to joke around.

163
00:09:50,896 --> 00:09:53,896
I was like, what am I supposed to do?

164
00:09:53,896 --> 00:09:57,896
And then I kept feeling nervous.

165
00:09:57,896 --> 00:10:01,896
I was like, I have to do this properly.

166
00:10:01,896 --> 00:10:03,896
I was pushing myself.

167
00:10:03,896 --> 00:10:08,896
I couldn't stand the pressure from
myself.

168
00:10:08,896 --> 00:10:15,408
I had a huge explosion in my head.

169
00:10:15,408 --> 00:10:18,408
I couldn't sing at all.

170
00:10:19,408 --> 00:10:21,408
I was like, what should I do?

171
00:10:21,408 --> 00:10:34,408
I was able to sing a little bit, but I
couldn't sing in my usual voice.

172
00:10:34,408 --> 00:10:37,408
I was like, what should I do?

173
00:10:37,408 --> 00:10:43,610
When I finished my practice that day, I
had a huge explosion.

174
00:10:43,610 --> 00:10:48,610
Koji Tatsuki, the former top star of
Takarazuka,

175
00:10:48,610 --> 00:10:52,610
from the practice room,

176
00:10:52,610 --> 00:10:56,610
he was sitting next to me

177
00:10:56,610 --> 00:11:03,610
and he was talking to me.

178
00:11:03,610 --> 00:11:12,610
He was giving me advice on what to do.

179
00:11:12,610 --> 00:11:17,610
He was so kind and wonderful.

180
00:11:17,610 --> 00:11:23,936
If you don't know how to do it, just be
confident and you'll be able to do it.

181
00:11:23,936 --> 00:11:26,656
I was told that I should work hard
together.

182
00:11:26,656 --> 00:11:30,016
But he said, there's no way.

183
00:11:30,016 --> 00:11:35,056
But he still said that to me.

184
00:11:35,056 --> 00:11:41,576
I was very grateful for the words, let's
work hard together.

185
00:11:41,576 --> 00:11:46,936
I heard it was a musical.

186
00:11:46,936 --> 00:11:54,896
I thought I shouldn't sing like I always
do.

187
00:11:54,896 --> 00:12:01,016
I thought I should sing like a woman.

188
00:12:01,016 --> 00:12:04,296
I had my own thoughts.

189
00:12:04,296 --> 00:12:06,776
That's why I was told that.

190
00:12:06,776 --> 00:12:10,496
But he told me that.

191
00:12:10,496 --> 00:12:13,840
He wanted to do that.

192
00:12:13,840 --> 00:12:18,240
So, I got this one too.

193
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:19,940
Look at this.

194
00:12:19,940 --> 00:12:21,540
How many are there?

195
00:12:21,540 --> 00:12:23,040
There are 4 rows.

196
00:12:23,040 --> 00:12:24,640
I was like, I did it.

197
00:12:24,640 --> 00:12:25,740
I did it.

198
00:12:25,740 --> 00:12:27,240
I'll try it.

199
00:12:27,240 --> 00:12:28,240
It's hard.

200
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:29,440
I was like, I did it.

201
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:31,440
I was supposed to do it like that.

202
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:34,240
But I talked too much about Elf.

203
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:37,240
So, I don't have much time left.

204
00:12:37,240 --> 00:12:39,640
Next time.

205
00:12:39,640 --> 00:12:41,392
Next time?

206
00:12:41,392 --> 00:12:46,392
I'll try my best.

207
00:12:46,392 --> 00:12:55,921
Thank you for listening to Elf's story.
