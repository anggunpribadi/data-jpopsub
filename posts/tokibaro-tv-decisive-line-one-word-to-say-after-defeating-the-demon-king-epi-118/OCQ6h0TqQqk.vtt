00:00.000 --> 00:04.000
 Let's start the second round.

00:04.000 --> 00:08.000
 Next is the video of us defeating the
Demon King.

00:10.000 --> 00:14.000
 Next is the video of us defeating the
Demon King.

00:14.000 --> 00:16.000
 I'm scared of this game.

00:16.000 --> 00:19.000
 Everyone is scared of this game.

00:19.000 --> 00:20.000
 I'm scared of this game.

00:20.000 --> 00:22.000
 I'm looking forward to playing this
game alone.

00:22.000 --> 00:24.000
 I'm scared of this game.

00:24.000 --> 00:27.000
 I can hear the sound of the game from
the next room.

00:27.000 --> 00:30.000
 Let's play this game.

00:35.322 --> 00:42.906
 This program is brought to you by the
members who are working to promote their
activities.

00:42.906 --> 00:44.866
 Up for 500mm?

01:11.840 --> 01:13.840
 I'm so scared.

01:13.840 --> 01:15.840
 How was it?

01:15.840 --> 01:17.840
 I'm so scared.

01:17.840 --> 01:19.840
 We're enjoying it.

01:19.840 --> 01:21.840
 We're enjoying it.

01:21.840 --> 01:23.840
 I'm so scared.

01:23.840 --> 01:25.840
 Are you okay?

01:25.840 --> 01:29.840
 After fighting to the end,

01:29.840 --> 01:31.840
 I'm the last one.

01:31.840 --> 01:33.840
 I see.

01:33.840 --> 01:35.840
 I'm the last one.

01:35.840 --> 01:37.840
 I'm the last one.

01:37.840 --> 01:39.840
 I'm the last one.

01:39.840 --> 01:41.840
 It was a great time!

01:41.840 --> 01:43.840
 Let's go fast.

01:43.840 --> 01:45.840
 Let's go!

01:45.840 --> 01:47.840
 Let's go!

01:47.840 --> 01:49.840
 Let's go!

01:49.840 --> 01:51.840
 The ending scene!

01:51.840 --> 01:53.840
 The end scene!

01:53.840 --> 01:55.840
 I'm OK!

01:55.840 --> 01:57.840
 Everyone!

01:57.840 --> 01:59.840
 Everyone!

01:59.840 --> 02:01.840
 First Half

02:01.840 --> 02:02.202
 Second Half

02:02.202 --> 02:03.202
 Ha!

02:03.202 --> 02:05.202
 Ha ha ha ha!

02:05.202 --> 02:06.202
 This is the last!

02:06.202 --> 02:09.202
 My secret technique, take this!

02:09.202 --> 02:13.952
 Cl cruising!

02:13.952 --> 02:18.952
 I'll make you my enemy next time.

02:18.952 --> 02:19.952
 See you.

02:19.952 --> 02:20.952
 What?

02:20.952 --> 02:21.952
 What?

02:21.952 --> 02:22.952
 Good!

02:22.952 --> 02:23.952
 Good!

02:23.952 --> 02:24.952
 Good!

02:24.952 --> 02:25.952
 Good!

02:25.952 --> 02:26.952
 Good!

02:26.952 --> 02:27.952
 Good!

02:27.952 --> 02:28.952
 Good!

02:28.952 --> 02:30.952
 It's something that everyone can do.

02:30.952 --> 02:31.952
 Yes.

02:31.952 --> 02:32.952
 Oh!

02:36.440 --> 02:38.440
 Here you go!

02:38.440 --> 02:39.440
 Ready, set, go!

02:39.440 --> 02:40.440
 3 points!

02:40.440 --> 02:41.440
 3 points!

02:41.440 --> 02:42.440
 5 points!

02:42.440 --> 02:43.440
 4 points!

02:43.440 --> 02:44.440
 Here you go!

02:44.440 --> 02:45.440
 Hey!

02:47.440 --> 02:54.440
 I think the courage of the coupon and
the fun of the last scene are great.

02:54.440 --> 03:04.440
 In the last episode of the drama, there
are some lines that make you expect the
next development.

03:04.440 --> 03:08.440
 I felt that, so I gave 5 points.

03:08.440 --> 03:11.440
 First of all, I was really excited.

03:11.440 --> 03:15.440
 The way of entering the role was
professional.

03:15.440 --> 03:18.440
 It's like a professional.

03:18.440 --> 03:23.440
 At first, I was pretty happy to laugh.

03:23.440 --> 03:29.440
 I thought it was good to be defeated in
the end, so I gave 5 points.

03:33.440 --> 03:36.440
 I, KANAMIN, got 10 points!

03:39.440 --> 03:40.440
 That's great.

03:41.440 --> 03:42.440
 Wait a minute.

03:42.440 --> 03:44.440
 What should I do?

03:44.440 --> 03:47.440
 It's totally different from KANAMIN.

03:47.440 --> 03:50.440
 I'm not good at situations.

03:50.440 --> 03:52.440
 I usually defeat the enemy first.

03:52.440 --> 03:56.440
 So, don't worry about the part where
you defeat the enemy.

03:56.440 --> 03:58.440
 I'll give you a word after you defeat
the enemy.

03:58.440 --> 03:59.440
 That's great.

04:01.440 --> 04:02.440
 I'm the strongest.

04:02.440 --> 04:04.440
 Like a demon hunter.

04:04.440 --> 04:06.440
 The way of cutting is dangerous.

04:06.440 --> 04:08.440
 Please pay attention to that.

04:08.440 --> 04:09.440
 Here you go!

04:09.440 --> 04:13.722
 I cut KANAMIN's limb.

04:13.722 --> 04:15.722
 Take this!

04:15.722 --> 04:25.722
 I'm the only one who can beat her.

04:37.808 --> 04:39.808
 I'm going to go.

04:39.808 --> 04:41.808
 4 points.

04:41.808 --> 04:43.808
 4 points.

04:43.808 --> 04:45.808
 3 points.

04:45.808 --> 04:47.808
 The last one is a famous saying.

04:47.808 --> 04:49.808
 I'm the only one who can beat me.

04:49.808 --> 04:51.808
 It's a famous saying.

04:51.808 --> 04:53.808
 4 points.

04:53.808 --> 04:55.808
 Cool.

04:55.808 --> 04:57.808
 I thought it was cool at the end.

04:57.808 --> 04:59.808
 This is a famous saying.

05:01.808 --> 05:03.808
 It's a good way to tie it up.

05:03.808 --> 05:07.808
 I think it's a world view.

05:07.808 --> 05:09.808
 Thank you.

05:09.808 --> 05:11.808
 I got 4 points.

05:11.808 --> 05:13.808
 Sakai, you watch too much anime.

05:17.808 --> 05:19.808
 Sakai is a great person.

05:21.808 --> 05:23.808
 It's cool.

05:23.808 --> 05:25.808
 I got 4 points.

05:25.808 --> 05:27.808
 19 points.

05:27.808 --> 05:29.808
 I got the same score as the first one.

05:29.808 --> 05:31.808
 Everyone got 4 points.

05:33.808 --> 05:35.808
 I'm going to go next.

05:35.808 --> 05:37.808
 What is this?

05:37.808 --> 05:39.808
 What should I say?

05:41.808 --> 05:43.808
 You're so lame.

05:43.808 --> 05:45.808
 You're the same age as me.

05:45.808 --> 05:47.808
 We have the same height.

05:51.808 --> 05:53.808
 I used the knowledge of the person
above 7.

05:53.808 --> 05:55.808
 Thank you for your hard work.

05:55.808 --> 06:04.026
 Please watch the next video as well.

06:04.026 --> 06:05.986
 3rd Place

06:07.186 --> 06:08.346
 Now we're tied!

06:12.122 --> 06:16.122
 Don't worry. I'm a Minenjin.

06:20.122 --> 06:22.122
 What did you say?

06:22.122 --> 06:25.122
 Minenjin is a...

06:26.122 --> 06:27.122
 A non-dying person?

06:27.122 --> 06:28.122
 Yes!

06:28.122 --> 06:29.122
 A non-dying person.

06:29.122 --> 06:31.122
 The most painful one.

06:32.122 --> 06:34.122
 The most painful one.

06:34.122 --> 06:39.962
 A non-dying person.

06:39.962 --> 06:41.962
 I'm going to start.

06:41.962 --> 06:43.962
 2 points.

06:43.962 --> 06:45.962
 3 points.

06:45.962 --> 06:47.962
 3 points.

06:47.962 --> 06:49.962
 I'm going to start.

06:49.962 --> 06:51.962
 She is kind.

06:51.962 --> 06:53.962
 What kind?

06:53.962 --> 06:55.962
 She is kind.

06:55.962 --> 06:57.962
 She doesn't make me feel down.

06:57.962 --> 06:59.962
 She is kind.

07:01.962 --> 07:03.962
 She holds my teeth.

07:03.962 --> 07:05.962
 She holds my teeth.

07:05.962 --> 07:09.962
 I thought she couldn't hold my teeth.

07:09.962 --> 07:11.962
 She holds my teeth.

07:11.962 --> 07:13.962
 I remembered that.

07:13.962 --> 07:15.962
 I felt that later.

07:15.962 --> 07:17.962
 It was funny.

07:17.962 --> 07:19.962
 It was funny.

07:19.962 --> 07:21.962
 It was funny.

07:21.962 --> 07:25.962
 She was a joke.

07:25.962 --> 07:27.962
 It was the most interesting.

07:27.962 --> 07:29.962
 It was funny.

07:29.962 --> 07:31.962
 It was funny.

07:31.962 --> 07:33.962
 The score of OHADO is 13.

07:33.962 --> 07:35.962
 The score of OHADO is 13.

07:35.962 --> 07:37.962
 It's higher than I expected.

07:39.962 --> 07:41.962
 I'm sorry that the score is 6 points.

07:43.962 --> 07:45.962
 It was funny.

07:47.962 --> 07:49.962
 The fourth one.

07:49.962 --> 07:51.962
 The setting is important.

07:53.962 --> 07:55.962
 What are you doing?

07:55.962 --> 08:01.376
 The setting is...

08:01.376 --> 08:03.376
 Humanity.

08:03.376 --> 08:08.376
 The setting is that the enemy is
humanity.

08:08.376 --> 08:13.376
 And there are only bad people around.

08:13.376 --> 08:18.376
 I think it's the most painful enemy in
my life.

08:18.376 --> 08:21.376
 Let's watch the video.

08:21.376 --> 08:24.376
 The first attack.

08:24.376 --> 08:27.376
 The second attack.

08:27.376 --> 08:30.376
 The last blow.

08:30.376 --> 08:32.376
 The end.

08:32.986 --> 08:36.986
 The world is not all bad guys.

08:38.986 --> 08:40.986
 I see.

08:44.986 --> 08:46.986
 It was a short but cool performance.

08:48.986 --> 08:50.986
 It was a mysterious feeling.

08:50.986 --> 08:52.986
 What was the last line?

08:52.986 --> 08:54.986
 It was a dangerous feeling.

08:58.904 --> 09:00.904
 Did you get it?

09:00.904 --> 09:01.904
 Yes, I did.

09:01.904 --> 09:02.904
 Please.

09:02.904 --> 09:03.904
 4 points.

09:03.904 --> 09:04.904
 3 points.

09:04.904 --> 09:05.904
 3 points.

09:05.904 --> 09:06.904
 4 points.

09:06.904 --> 09:07.904
 Oh, I got it.

09:08.904 --> 09:11.904
 I was surprised at the first one.

09:11.904 --> 09:13.904
 I was surprised at the first one.

09:13.904 --> 09:15.904
 It was beautiful.

09:15.904 --> 09:17.904
 It was beautiful.

09:17.904 --> 09:19.904
 I was surprised at that.

09:19.904 --> 09:20.904
 I was surprised at that.

09:20.904 --> 09:22.904
 The first one was cute.

09:22.904 --> 09:24.904
 It was a secret.

09:24.904 --> 09:27.904
 She was surprised at the first one.

09:27.904 --> 09:29.904
 I was surprised at the first one.

09:29.904 --> 09:31.760
 I was surprised at the first one.

09:32.760 --> 09:36.760
 Hiroto was so cool. I was impressed.

09:36.760 --> 09:37.760
 I was impressed.

09:37.760 --> 09:39.760
 I was impressed.

09:40.218 --> 09:42.218
 I got 2 points.

09:42.218 --> 09:44.218
 Thank you.

09:48.218 --> 09:50.218
 I got 17 points.

09:50.218 --> 09:52.218
 Good job.

09:52.218 --> 09:54.218
 It's a high score.

09:58.218 --> 10:00.218
 Next, I'll give you a hint.

10:00.218 --> 10:04.218
 I don't look at the cut part.

10:04.218 --> 10:06.218
 I'm a hero.

10:06.218 --> 10:08.218
 I'm a hero.

10:08.218 --> 10:10.218
 I got a hint.

10:12.872 --> 10:13.872
 I see.

10:13.872 --> 10:18.872
 Next, please.

10:20.538 --> 10:21.898
 Roopctive isn't here now haha

10:21.898 --> 10:22.898
 Oh my harusan

10:28.826 --> 10:30.826
 I'm a weak opponent.

10:31.826 --> 10:34.826
 This enemy has not been defeated for
100 years.

10:35.826 --> 10:36.826
 Red!

10:37.826 --> 10:38.826
 Come on.

10:38.826 --> 10:39.826
 You did your best.

10:40.826 --> 10:41.826
 Julia is...

10:42.826 --> 10:43.826
 Julia is...

10:43.826 --> 10:45.826
 Who is the enemy?

10:45.826 --> 10:47.826
 Who do you hate?

10:47.826 --> 10:50.826
 I will continue to protect you.

10:50.826 --> 10:51.826
 Come on.

10:51.826 --> 10:56.826
 Who is the enemy?

10:58.778 --> 11:00.778
 I'm a fake band.

11:00.778 --> 11:02.778
 Fake band.

11:02.778 --> 11:04.778
 I'll do my best.

11:04.778 --> 11:06.778
 Fake band.

11:06.778 --> 11:08.778
 The result is...

11:08.778 --> 11:10.778
 OK.

11:10.778 --> 11:12.778
 2 points.

11:12.778 --> 11:14.778
 2 points.

11:14.778 --> 11:16.778
 3 points.

11:16.778 --> 11:20.432
 Thank you for watching.

11:49.168 --> 11:52.968
 I think it was a bit too tight.

11:52.968 --> 11:56.168
 So I gave it a 1.

11:56.168 --> 12:00.668
 So, Chikiyu got 11 points!

12:00.668 --> 12:02.668
 Yay!

12:02.668 --> 12:06.168
 And last, Aki-chan!

12:06.168 --> 12:09.168
 Everyone's looking forward to this!

12:09.168 --> 12:11.168
 What is it like?

12:11.168 --> 12:12.168
 Oh, nice.

12:12.168 --> 12:16.168
 I'm not sure if I'm pretty or not.

12:16.168 --> 12:19.168
 The title is...

12:19.168 --> 12:23.168
 Ise Dai Maou no Tanjou!

12:23.168 --> 12:24.168
 Let's watch it!

12:24.168 --> 12:34.554

12:34.554 --> 12:38.554
 I'm the best!

12:46.330 --> 12:48.330
 I see.

12:48.330 --> 12:50.330
 I see.

12:50.330 --> 12:52.330
 It was the easiest to understand.

12:52.330 --> 12:59.330

13:09.744 --> 13:11.744
 It was a clean score.

13:11.744 --> 13:14.744
 You have a great courage.

13:14.744 --> 13:16.744
 You can show your power.

13:17.744 --> 13:18.744
 And,

13:18.744 --> 13:19.744
 it's good.

13:19.744 --> 13:21.744
 I couldn't think of the setting.

13:21.744 --> 13:24.744
 I defeated the devil and I became blue.

13:24.744 --> 13:29.744
 I was surprised when I saw the enemy in
the room next to me.

13:29.744 --> 13:32.744
 I thought it was the enemy when I
defeated it.

13:32.744 --> 13:35.744
 But, I was the strongest.

13:35.744 --> 13:37.744
 I was Gaou.

13:37.744 --> 13:41.744
 I thought it was amazing.

13:41.744 --> 13:42.744
 I was able to see it.

13:42.744 --> 13:44.744
 I thought you were attractive.

13:44.744 --> 13:46.744
 I did it!

13:46.744 --> 13:48.744
 I did it!

13:48.744 --> 13:50.744
 I did it!

13:50.744 --> 13:58.744
 I was able to tell the story with this
short time and lines.

13:58.744 --> 14:00.744
 I was able to show my charm.

14:00.744 --> 14:05.744
 I was a critical hit!

14:11.744 --> 14:13.744
 I was a critical hit.

14:13.744 --> 14:14.744
 You did it!

14:19.744 --> 14:23.744
 Aki-chan's score is 22 points.

14:23.744 --> 14:25.744
 Congratulations!

14:25.744 --> 14:28.744
 You got a total of 6 points.

14:28.744 --> 14:34.744
 The winner is Aki-chan with 39 points!

14:38.744 --> 14:39.744
 You're the winner.

14:39.744 --> 14:42.744
 You were great at the last part.

14:42.744 --> 14:43.744
 You were great.

14:43.744 --> 14:47.744
 Maou got Aki-chan.

14:47.744 --> 14:50.744
 Julia got the handkerchief.

14:50.744 --> 14:52.744
 You were great.

14:52.744 --> 14:55.168
 What? I have a lot of water.

14:56.168 --> 15:00.168
 I'm not good at running on the net.

15:00.168 --> 15:02.168
 I'm going to do my best.

15:02.168 --> 15:03.168
 Hitochan.

15:03.168 --> 15:04.168
 Hitochan.

15:04.168 --> 15:05.168
 Oh, you're right.

15:05.168 --> 15:07.168
 I'm the same height as her.

15:07.168 --> 15:08.168
 We're the same height.

15:08.168 --> 15:09.168
 We're the same height.

15:09.168 --> 15:10.168
 We're the same height.

15:10.168 --> 15:13.168
 I want to try this in various
situations.

15:13.168 --> 15:17.168
 We all think about it here and see it
here.

15:17.168 --> 15:21.168
 We can come up with various ideas.

15:21.168 --> 15:22.168
 It's interesting.

15:22.168 --> 15:24.168
 I think it's unique.

15:24.168 --> 15:27.168
 I didn't expect it to be a man's
setting.

15:27.168 --> 15:29.168
 I didn't think of it.

15:29.168 --> 15:30.168
 It's the opposite.

15:30.168 --> 15:33.168
 I didn't think of a woman's setting.

15:33.168 --> 15:36.168
 This is also interesting.

15:36.168 --> 15:39.168
 It's a great idea.

15:39.168 --> 15:44.168
 Thank you for watching until the end.

15:44.168 --> 15:46.168
 Please write the situation.

15:46.168 --> 15:48.168
 I'll look for it.

15:48.168 --> 15:50.168
 I'm looking for it.

15:50.168 --> 15:52.168
 Please.

15:54.074 --> 16:02.074
 I hope we can continue to create
wonderful scenery together.

16:08.656 --> 16:11.156
 I don't have a destination for my
dreams

16:11.156 --> 16:13.156
 I love you, love you, love you, love
you

16:13.156 --> 16:15.156
 I love you, love you, love you, love
you

16:15.156 --> 16:17.156
 I love you, love you, love you, love
you

16:17.156 --> 16:22.656
 Everything that exists for you to be
there

16:22.656 --> 16:26.656
 The July cider you spilled

16:26.656 --> 16:31.156
 I can't forget that night

16:31.156 --> 16:34.592
 It hurts, it hurts, it hurts so much

16:35.592 --> 16:37.592
 I want to erase every day

16:37.592 --> 16:41.592
 The more I run, the more I laugh

16:41.592 --> 16:44.592
 Let's shine brighter than anyone else

16:44.592 --> 16:46.592
 A self-contained ruin

16:47.482 --> 16:51.482
 Please like and subscribe!

17:17.482 --> 17:27.482
 Please like and subscribe!

17:27.738 --> 17:32.738
 I can say it now, the reason for my
tears

17:32.738 --> 17:36.738
 When I'm lost, I remember right away

17:36.738 --> 17:40.738
 Even if it rains, I'll smile

17:40.738 --> 17:44.738
 Look, let's go anywhere

17:44.738 --> 17:48.738
 Goodbye, goodbye, to me of yesterday

17:48.738 --> 17:52.738
 The city lights after the rain are
sparkling

17:52.738 --> 17:56.738
 My heart is like a sunny day, the sound
of the rain drops

17:56.738 --> 18:00.738
 I play the rainbow piano

18:00.738 --> 18:05.738
 Goodbye, goodbye, to me of yesterday

18:05.738 --> 18:09.738
 The city lights after the rain are
sparkling

18:09.738 --> 18:13.738
 My heart is like a flower, the sound of
the rain drops

18:13.738 --> 18:37.738
 I wear a rainbow dress

18:38.106 --> 18:40.106
 Thank you for watching!
