00:00:00,800 --> 00:00:02,880
Result

2
00:00:07,960 --> 00:00:08,960
Ready?

3
00:00:08,960 --> 00:00:12,960
Happy New Year!

4
00:00:15,200 --> 00:00:18,200
So, this is the first episode of the new
year.

5
00:00:18,200 --> 00:00:21,200
Thank you for your support this year.

6
00:00:21,200 --> 00:00:23,200
I'm the host, Bananaman.

7
00:00:23,200 --> 00:00:25,200
And this is Mr. Ogizaka.

8
00:00:28,200 --> 00:00:29,200
Thank you.

9
00:00:29,200 --> 00:00:30,200
Thank you.

10
00:00:31,200 --> 00:00:32,200
What?

11
00:00:32,200 --> 00:00:33,200
What?

12
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:35,200
What are you doing?

13
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:36,200
What?

14
00:00:40,480 --> 00:00:43,480
Ready, set, B!

15
00:00:43,480 --> 00:00:45,480
Ah, so that's how it is.

16
00:00:45,480 --> 00:00:47,480
I see, so that's how it is.

17
00:00:47,480 --> 00:00:50,480
Himura-san, please announce today's
topic.

18
00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:51,480
Let's go!

19
00:00:51,480 --> 00:00:54,480
Let's look back at 2022!

20
00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:57,480
B-class news!

21
00:01:01,480 --> 00:01:06,480
Last year, Nogizaka 46 provided various
news to the world.

22
00:01:06,480 --> 00:01:12,480
For this we will reveal a
generalLaughing small news from
the�rowings that everyone had no chance
of knowing.

23
00:01:13,488 --> 00:01:17,488
First, the B class news from January to
March.

24
00:01:20,968 --> 00:01:22,968
Akimoto, hated by Yakubo.

25
00:01:23,968 --> 00:01:25,968
Umezawa, banana and ice cream.

26
00:01:26,968 --> 00:01:28,968
Kubo, eyebrow is leaking.

27
00:01:30,968 --> 00:01:32,968
Endo, found a perfect mug.

28
00:01:34,968 --> 00:01:36,968
Nakamura, fell and got a connection.

29
00:01:38,968 --> 00:01:40,968
Umezawa, father and class 5.

30
00:01:41,968 --> 00:01:44,968
That's all for January to March,
Nogizaka B class news.

31
00:01:44,968 --> 00:01:48,968
There was a time when I didn't care
about the title.

32
00:01:49,968 --> 00:01:51,968
There was a time when I was curious.

33
00:01:52,968 --> 00:01:54,968
January, Akimoto, hated by Yakubo.

34
00:01:55,968 --> 00:01:57,968
I didn't hate him that much.

35
00:01:58,968 --> 00:02:00,968
We had a Valentine's Day project.

36
00:02:01,968 --> 00:02:03,968
We made a group line of all 4th graders.

37
00:02:04,968 --> 00:02:06,968
We talked to everyone about what we
noticed.

38
00:02:07,968 --> 00:02:10,968
We gave clothes to Yakubo and other
children.

39
00:02:10,968 --> 00:02:12,968
We did that.

40
00:02:13,968 --> 00:02:15,968
There was no element of being hated.

41
00:02:16,968 --> 00:02:18,968
We didn't use the group mail at all.

42
00:02:19,968 --> 00:02:21,968
We didn't use it at all.

43
00:02:22,968 --> 00:02:24,968
We could have done it before the live.

44
00:02:25,968 --> 00:02:27,968
I thought it was a lie.

45
00:02:28,968 --> 00:02:30,968
We let it go.

46
00:02:31,968 --> 00:02:35,968
I personally felt sorry for Yakubo.

47
00:02:35,968 --> 00:02:39,968
I wanted to give him clothes.

48
00:02:40,968 --> 00:02:42,968
I sent it.

49
00:02:43,968 --> 00:02:45,968
I read it for a few months.

50
00:02:46,968 --> 00:02:48,968
I read it.

51
00:02:49,968 --> 00:02:51,968
I thought he hated me.

52
00:02:52,968 --> 00:02:56,968
After 2 months, I sent a mail to Yakubo.

53
00:02:57,968 --> 00:02:59,968
I got a reply.

54
00:03:00,968 --> 00:03:02,968
That's January 20th.

55
00:03:02,968 --> 00:03:04,968
It's March.

56
00:03:05,968 --> 00:03:07,968
Yakubo was a great MC.

57
00:03:08,968 --> 00:03:10,968
I wanted to tell him that he was great.

58
00:03:11,968 --> 00:03:13,968
I sent a mail.

59
00:03:14,968 --> 00:03:16,968
I got a reply on that day.

60
00:03:17,968 --> 00:03:19,968
Please listen to me.

61
00:03:20,968 --> 00:03:22,968
I'm a person who keeps in touch.

62
00:03:23,968 --> 00:03:25,968
I received a lot of messages.

63
00:03:26,968 --> 00:03:28,968
I didn't notice it until March.

64
00:03:28,968 --> 00:03:31,968
I received a lot of messages.

65
00:03:32,968 --> 00:03:34,968
How many messages did you get?

66
00:03:35,968 --> 00:03:37,968
More than 100.

67
00:03:38,968 --> 00:03:40,968
You don't check it on LINE?

68
00:03:41,968 --> 00:03:43,968
I get a lot of coupons.

69
00:03:44,968 --> 00:03:46,968
How many coupons do you get?

70
00:03:47,968 --> 00:03:49,968
How many coupons do you get?

71
00:03:50,968 --> 00:03:55,968
I'm the captain of the seniors of
Nogizaka.

72
00:03:55,968 --> 00:03:57,968
You are the captain.

73
00:03:58,968 --> 00:04:00,968
I get a lot of coupons.

74
00:04:01,968 --> 00:04:06,968
Do you have any other members who
haven't read it?

75
00:04:07,968 --> 00:04:09,968
I have a record.

76
00:04:10,968 --> 00:04:12,968
I don't know when I'll be back.

77
00:04:13,968 --> 00:04:15,968
That's a perfect example.

78
00:04:16,968 --> 00:04:18,968
Yakubo is scary.

79
00:04:19,968 --> 00:04:21,968
He is cool.

80
00:04:21,968 --> 00:04:24,968
He is scary.

81
00:04:25,968 --> 00:04:27,968
Next is Ume.

82
00:04:28,968 --> 00:04:32,968
I've been into Kanure for 21 years.

83
00:04:33,968 --> 00:04:35,968
Kanure was popular.

84
00:04:36,968 --> 00:04:38,968
I've been into it for a while.

85
00:04:39,968 --> 00:04:41,968
Ume, that's not true.

86
00:04:42,968 --> 00:04:46,968
My family is popular.

87
00:04:46,968 --> 00:04:52,968
I don't usually watch it, but I think
I'm popular.

88
00:04:53,968 --> 00:04:55,968
It's the same as that.

89
00:04:56,968 --> 00:04:58,968
In June, BANANA MAN was on the radio.

90
00:04:59,968 --> 00:05:01,968
He was doing a Kanure battle.

91
00:05:02,968 --> 00:05:04,968
Was that popular?

92
00:05:05,968 --> 00:05:07,968
It's late in June.

93
00:05:08,968 --> 00:05:10,968
Did you hear that?

94
00:05:10,968 --> 00:05:15,968
I recommended Kanure to him.

95
00:05:16,968 --> 00:05:18,968
He didn't eat it.

96
00:05:19,968 --> 00:05:21,968
I see.

97
00:05:22,968 --> 00:05:24,968
He didn't give it to you.

98
00:05:25,968 --> 00:05:27,968
That's a lie.

99
00:05:28,968 --> 00:05:30,968
We also recommended it.

100
00:05:31,968 --> 00:05:33,968
I wanted to interact with him.

101
00:05:34,968 --> 00:05:36,968
I thought you didn't interact with him.

102
00:05:36,968 --> 00:05:39,968
This is a Kanure that is only found in
Hokkaido.

103
00:05:40,968 --> 00:05:42,968
I'm ordering it because there is no shop
in the Kanto area.

104
00:05:43,968 --> 00:05:45,968
Are you ordering Kanure?

105
00:05:46,968 --> 00:05:48,968
I like it the most.

106
00:05:49,968 --> 00:05:52,968
I like the softness of the outside and
the softness of the inside.

107
00:05:53,968 --> 00:05:55,968
I think it's the ultimate.

108
00:05:55,968 --> 00:05:59,536
Please subscribe to our channel.

109
00:06:00,536 --> 00:06:01,736
This is very delicious.

110
00:06:03,856 --> 00:06:06,016
This is a pudding.

111
00:06:06,016 --> 00:06:07,376
Is that so?

112
00:06:07,376 --> 00:06:08,736
This is very delicious.

113
00:06:08,736 --> 00:06:10,776
This is very crispy.

114
00:06:10,776 --> 00:06:14,056
This is very delicious.

115
00:06:14,056 --> 00:06:16,256
This is delicious.

116
00:06:16,256 --> 00:06:18,376
How many canelés have you eaten?

117
00:06:18,376 --> 00:06:21,456
I ate 100 canelés this year.

118
00:06:21,456 --> 00:06:23,976
That's amazing.

119
00:06:23,976 --> 00:06:25,576
You are getting bigger with canelés.

120
00:06:25,576 --> 00:06:29,256
This is amazing.

121
00:06:29,256 --> 00:06:30,856
Next is KUBO.

122
00:06:30,856 --> 00:06:31,496
What is this?

123
00:06:31,496 --> 00:06:36,016
I was doing a morning information
program in February.

124
00:06:36,016 --> 00:06:39,016
I needed a video for the survey.

125
00:06:39,016 --> 00:06:42,216
I needed the members to appear in the
video.

126
00:06:42,216 --> 00:06:45,496
I took a video with UMEZAWA and
YAMASHITA.

127
00:06:45,496 --> 00:06:49,696
I sent the survey without checking it.

128
00:06:49,696 --> 00:06:52,296
I was taking a video with the app.

129
00:06:52,296 --> 00:06:58,416
I accidentally set the app to the
darkest setting.

130
00:06:58,416 --> 00:06:59,776
Is that possible?

131
00:06:59,776 --> 00:07:02,976
I sent the video without realizing it.

132
00:07:02,976 --> 00:07:05,136
The video was broadcast live.

133
00:07:05,136 --> 00:07:06,056
Was it broadcast live?

134
00:07:06,056 --> 00:07:07,576
Yes.

135
00:07:07,576 --> 00:07:09,256
I have a video of that.

136
00:07:09,256 --> 00:07:10,096
I want to see it.

137
00:07:13,696 --> 00:07:16,176
Everyone is a little scared.

138
00:07:18,096 --> 00:07:21,656
UMEZAWA and YAMASHITA are involved in
this.

139
00:07:21,656 --> 00:07:22,456
This is amazing.

140
00:07:22,456 --> 00:07:23,456
Did this video get broadcast?

141
00:07:23,456 --> 00:07:24,656
Yes.

142
00:07:24,656 --> 00:07:28,376
I thought I had done this during the
live broadcast.

143
00:07:28,376 --> 00:07:30,696
Did the manager check this?

144
00:07:30,696 --> 00:07:32,536
I was checked.

145
00:07:32,536 --> 00:07:36,576
But no one was able to see this.

146
00:07:36,576 --> 00:07:39,696
I didn't get caught by the fans.

147
00:07:39,696 --> 00:07:41,056
You three are doing this.

148
00:07:41,056 --> 00:07:44,136
This is the latest eyebrow.

149
00:07:44,136 --> 00:07:44,936
Maybe.

150
00:07:44,936 --> 00:07:47,856
I put my eyebrows on my bangs.

151
00:07:47,856 --> 00:07:50,296
Did you get a lot of work for your
eyebrows?

152
00:07:50,296 --> 00:07:52,456
I'm sorry.

153
00:07:52,456 --> 00:07:53,696
Please be careful.

154
00:07:53,696 --> 00:07:55,096
I will be careful in the future.

155
00:07:55,096 --> 00:07:58,256
This is a long-lasting video.

156
00:07:58,256 --> 00:08:00,296
Next is the end.

157
00:08:00,296 --> 00:08:02,496
This is a very unnecessary video.

158
00:08:02,496 --> 00:08:03,456
What is this?

159
00:08:03,456 --> 00:08:09,016
This is a video of the year-end party I
had at NUGIZAKA KOJI.

160
00:08:09,016 --> 00:08:13,256
This is the video of the year-end party
I had when I graduated from NUGIZAKA
KOJI.

161
00:08:13,256 --> 00:08:17,376
This is the video of the year-end party
I won at NUGIZAKA KOJI.

162
00:08:17,376 --> 00:08:20,416
This is the video of the year-end party
I won at NUGIZAKA KOJI.

163
00:08:20,416 --> 00:08:21,696
Do you use this?

164
00:08:21,696 --> 00:08:23,696
This is disgusting.

165
00:08:23,696 --> 00:08:26,376
What did you drink?

166
00:08:26,376 --> 00:08:28,376
This is a coffee drink.

167
00:08:28,376 --> 00:08:30,416
This is easy to use.

168
00:08:30,416 --> 00:08:31,776
I love this.

169
00:08:31,776 --> 00:08:34,816
You can make a cute face with this cup.

170
00:08:34,816 --> 00:08:35,856
This is good.

171
00:08:35,856 --> 00:08:37,256
I use this.

172
00:08:37,256 --> 00:08:38,136
What about me?

173
00:08:38,136 --> 00:08:40,096
Do you use the video you just drew?

174
00:08:40,096 --> 00:08:43,856
This is very intimidating.

175
00:08:43,856 --> 00:08:45,776
You are right-handed, right?

176
00:08:45,776 --> 00:08:48,816
I'm right-handed.

177
00:08:48,816 --> 00:08:51,696
But I don't like it.

178
00:08:51,696 --> 00:08:56,336
You are like a god living in a toilet.

179
00:08:56,336 --> 00:08:59,376
You are alive.

180
00:08:59,376 --> 00:09:01,616
When your friends come, you use this.

181
00:09:01,616 --> 00:09:04,256
I don't use this.

182
00:09:04,256 --> 00:09:05,616
I use this alone.

183
00:09:05,616 --> 00:09:07,416
Next is you.

184
00:09:07,416 --> 00:09:08,616
What is this?

185
00:09:08,616 --> 00:09:17,536
Last year, I, MUKAI HAZUKI, and YUMIKI
NAHO were cast in a drama.

186
00:09:17,536 --> 00:09:18,536
You did something.

187
00:09:18,536 --> 00:09:21,656
I'm talking about the scene.

188
00:09:21,656 --> 00:09:23,856
I was shooting at school.

189
00:09:23,856 --> 00:09:26,456
I was going to join the shooting later.

190
00:09:26,456 --> 00:09:28,216
I was angry at the time.

191
00:09:28,216 --> 00:09:31,056
I ran in a hurry and said good morning
to the scene.

192
00:09:31,056 --> 00:09:32,576
I went to the scene.

193
00:09:32,576 --> 00:09:34,576
There was a pitfall.

194
00:09:34,576 --> 00:09:37,256
I got stuck in the pitfall.

195
00:09:37,256 --> 00:09:39,176
I was injured.

196
00:09:39,176 --> 00:09:42,216
What is the situation?

197
00:09:42,216 --> 00:09:44,936
Is this a prank?

198
00:09:44,936 --> 00:09:47,856
This is a pitfall that was created
naturally.

199
00:09:47,856 --> 00:09:49,096
Did you dig a pitfall?

200
00:09:49,096 --> 00:09:50,336
No.

201
00:09:50,336 --> 00:09:53,096
I'm told that I can work at a
construction site.

202
00:09:53,096 --> 00:09:56,096
I don't think so.

203
00:09:56,096 --> 00:09:59,376
There is a connection in the drama.

204
00:09:59,376 --> 00:10:02,016
I was wearing a uniform and my knees
were out.

205
00:10:02,016 --> 00:10:03,856
I was worried.

206
00:10:03,856 --> 00:10:10,356
I played solving a problem in a drama.

207
00:10:10,556 --> 00:10:14,176
The drama was connected.

208
00:10:15,096 --> 00:10:17,336
There is no need for a knee surgery.

209
00:10:17,336 --> 00:10:19,896
Does it just connect?

210
00:10:19,896 --> 00:10:26,896
Stop it! Stop it! Stop it!

211
00:10:26,896 --> 00:10:28,896
It's for the connection, so it can't be
helped.

212
00:10:28,896 --> 00:10:33,896
This drama, me and Hazuki got hurt on
our knees.

213
00:10:33,896 --> 00:10:34,896
Why?

214
00:10:34,896 --> 00:10:40,896
Hazuki was called by the director and
didn't want to be scolded, so she was
running to the bathroom.

215
00:10:40,896 --> 00:10:44,896
Then, she thought she was going to be
scolded, so she rushed and fell down.

216
00:10:44,896 --> 00:10:49,896
She fell down and was scolded by the
director.

217
00:10:49,896 --> 00:10:52,896
What's this?

218
00:10:52,896 --> 00:10:58,896
I thought it would be difficult to
connect the drama, so I didn't play the
role of receiving the DVD.

219
00:10:58,896 --> 00:11:01,896
What's the role of receiving the DVD?

220
00:11:01,896 --> 00:11:03,896
What kind of main actress is she?

221
00:11:03,896 --> 00:11:05,896
Three sisters with dirty knees.

222
00:11:06,896 --> 00:11:07,896
Next.

223
00:11:07,896 --> 00:11:09,896
I'm curious about this.

224
00:11:09,896 --> 00:11:10,896
What does this mean?

225
00:11:10,896 --> 00:11:14,896
I often talk on the phone with my
family.

226
00:11:14,896 --> 00:11:18,896
My brother was about to enter the first
year of high school in April.

227
00:11:18,896 --> 00:11:21,896
I was on the phone with my brother to
congratulate him.

228
00:11:21,896 --> 00:11:24,896
But my brother was gone, so I was on the
phone with my father.

229
00:11:24,896 --> 00:11:28,896
I started talking about my brother's
childhood.

230
00:11:28,896 --> 00:11:31,896
My brother said, he was a really good
guy.

231
00:11:31,896 --> 00:11:33,896
Your father started talking about you?

232
00:11:33,896 --> 00:11:34,896
That's amazing.

233
00:11:34,896 --> 00:11:44,896
When I was talking about my brother's
childhood, I was surprised to see my
father's face.

234
00:11:44,896 --> 00:11:46,896
He was cute.

235
00:11:46,896 --> 00:11:48,896
He was crying.

236
00:11:48,896 --> 00:11:52,896
I heard that and cried.

237
00:11:52,896 --> 00:11:54,896
We hid our tears.

238
00:11:54,896 --> 00:11:56,896
I can understand your voice.

239
00:11:56,896 --> 00:11:57,896
I was shaking.

240
00:11:57,896 --> 00:11:59,896
He is a good guy.

241
00:11:59,896 --> 00:12:03,896
I heard this from my grandmother.

242
00:12:03,896 --> 00:12:05,896
What is your grandmother?

243
00:12:05,896 --> 00:12:07,896
I'm sorry.

244
00:12:07,896 --> 00:12:09,896
I heard this from my grandmother.

245
00:12:09,896 --> 00:12:11,896
I heard the story of my brother's
childhood.

246
00:12:11,896 --> 00:12:13,896
It's a very hot story.

247
00:12:13,896 --> 00:12:14,896
Did you record it?

248
00:12:14,896 --> 00:12:15,896
I didn't.

249
00:12:15,896 --> 00:12:17,896
Why didn't you take a video of that
time?

250
00:12:17,896 --> 00:12:19,896
I definitely didn't record it.

251
00:12:19,896 --> 00:12:21,896
He was a really good boy.

252
00:12:21,896 --> 00:12:25,896
My parents were working when my brother
was about 4 years old.

253
00:12:25,896 --> 00:12:28,896
I often went to my grandmother's house.

254
00:12:28,896 --> 00:12:33,896
My grandmother usually said, welcome
home.

255
00:12:33,896 --> 00:12:38,896
My grandmother said, you must be tired.

256
00:12:38,896 --> 00:12:41,896
He was a really good boy.

257
00:12:42,896 --> 00:12:46,896
You are still a child.

258
00:12:46,896 --> 00:12:48,896
I heard this story from my grandmother.

259
00:12:48,896 --> 00:12:51,896
He was a good boy.

260
00:12:51,896 --> 00:12:54,896
I thought he was a good boy.

261
00:12:54,896 --> 00:12:56,896
I'm glad to hear that.

262
00:12:56,896 --> 00:12:58,896
I'm glad to hear that.

263
00:13:01,448 --> 00:13:04,448
From now on, we'll be covering the BQ
News from April to June.

264
00:13:06,448 --> 00:13:08,448
Kuromi is about to become an idol.

265
00:13:10,448 --> 00:13:12,448
Inoue is the first to sign.

266
00:13:14,448 --> 00:13:16,448
Atami, the tsutsui, is the only one
missing.

267
00:13:17,448 --> 00:13:20,448
Sato, the cake, is eaten by him.

268
00:13:22,448 --> 00:13:24,448
Shibata, the family, welcomes him with a
big welcome.

269
00:13:25,448 --> 00:13:28,448
Ogawa, the rain-like morning of a drama.

270
00:13:28,448 --> 00:13:32,448
That's all for the BQ News from April to
June.

271
00:13:36,448 --> 00:13:38,448
What's this? You're not an idol anymore?

272
00:13:39,448 --> 00:13:42,448
I actually started studying abroad in
April.

273
00:13:43,448 --> 00:13:45,448
I was welcomed as a new student.

274
00:13:46,448 --> 00:13:48,448
I'm making an idol group in this
university.

275
00:13:48,448 --> 00:13:50,448
Would you like to join the circle?

276
00:13:51,448 --> 00:13:54,448
Kuromi is so cute that she's calling
you.

277
00:13:55,448 --> 00:13:56,448
Is that true?

278
00:13:56,448 --> 00:13:58,448
You're not in the circle, are you?

279
00:13:59,448 --> 00:14:00,448
That's amazing.

280
00:14:00,448 --> 00:14:02,448
You look like you're going to do
something.

281
00:14:02,448 --> 00:14:04,448
You look like you're going to teach
something.

282
00:14:04,448 --> 00:14:05,448
You're not an idol.

283
00:14:06,448 --> 00:14:08,448
You look like you're going to do
something.

284
00:14:10,448 --> 00:14:12,448
You're not making your seniors feel
better?

285
00:14:12,448 --> 00:14:13,448
I'm fine.

286
00:14:13,448 --> 00:14:14,448
You were invited?

287
00:14:14,448 --> 00:14:16,448
I was invited and I even got a flyer.

288
00:14:16,448 --> 00:14:19,448
I said I'd think about it once and went
home.

289
00:14:19,448 --> 00:14:23,448
Miu Matsuo told me to dance in the
center.

290
00:14:23,448 --> 00:14:25,448
What are you going to do?

291
00:14:25,448 --> 00:14:27,448
You're going to dance in the corner?

292
00:14:27,448 --> 00:14:28,448
That's the end of it.

293
00:14:28,448 --> 00:14:30,448
There are so many amazing people.

294
00:14:30,448 --> 00:14:32,448
You can't do that.

295
00:14:32,448 --> 00:14:34,448
You're going to be a student pro
wrestler.

296
00:14:34,448 --> 00:14:36,448
You're going to be a student pro
wrestler.

297
00:14:36,448 --> 00:14:37,448
You're going to be a student pro
wrestler.

298
00:14:37,448 --> 00:14:39,448
There's one more thing.

299
00:14:40,448 --> 00:14:45,448
The picture of the student ID card is
gone.

300
00:14:46,448 --> 00:14:47,448
What is it?

301
00:14:47,448 --> 00:14:48,448
The picture.

302
00:14:48,448 --> 00:14:49,448
It's gone.

303
00:14:49,448 --> 00:14:51,448
What is it?

304
00:14:51,448 --> 00:14:53,448
It's scary.

305
00:14:53,448 --> 00:14:54,448
It's creepy.

306
00:14:54,448 --> 00:14:56,448
What is it?

307
00:14:56,448 --> 00:15:01,448
I found a skull, but it's a meat-stuffed
one.

308
00:15:01,448 --> 00:15:04,448
You're making a weird face with the app.

309
00:15:04,448 --> 00:15:06,448
You're doing too much.

310
00:15:06,448 --> 00:15:09,448
The machine made a mistake.

311
00:15:10,448 --> 00:15:11,448
You're lying.

312
00:15:11,448 --> 00:15:12,448
You're not good at it.

313
00:15:12,448 --> 00:15:14,448
It's not like anything.

314
00:15:15,448 --> 00:15:17,448
I didn't make it up.

315
00:15:17,448 --> 00:15:21,448
It's not that bad.

316
00:15:21,448 --> 00:15:22,448
What is it?

317
00:15:22,448 --> 00:15:25,448
The face is not that thin.

318
00:15:25,448 --> 00:15:27,448
It's a kama-kiri.

319
00:15:29,448 --> 00:15:31,448
It's funny.

320
00:15:31,448 --> 00:15:33,448
You made it kama-kiri.

321
00:15:33,448 --> 00:15:35,448
Why did you make it kama-kiri?

322
00:15:35,448 --> 00:15:37,448
You made it kama-kiri.

323
00:15:37,448 --> 00:15:39,448
Don't make it kama-kiri.

324
00:15:39,448 --> 00:15:41,448
It's not on the screen, but it's like
this.

325
00:15:43,448 --> 00:15:45,448
Use this picture as a passport.

326
00:15:45,448 --> 00:15:47,448
You can't enter any foreign country.

327
00:15:47,448 --> 00:15:48,448
It's true.

328
00:15:48,448 --> 00:15:51,448
You can only enter the Republic of
China.

329
00:15:53,448 --> 00:15:55,448
It's funny.

330
00:15:55,448 --> 00:15:56,448
You're amazing.

331
00:15:56,448 --> 00:15:59,448
I want you to join our idol group.

332
00:15:59,448 --> 00:16:03,648
April is only for Kuromi.

333
00:16:03,648 --> 00:16:05,648
Why are you alone in April?

334
00:16:05,648 --> 00:16:07,648
She is strong.

335
00:16:07,648 --> 00:16:10,648
I'm sorry if you eat this.

336
00:16:10,648 --> 00:16:11,648
Next.

337
00:16:11,648 --> 00:16:13,648
What is this?

338
00:16:13,648 --> 00:16:14,648
What does this mean?

339
00:16:14,648 --> 00:16:19,648
KAKI-SAN gave me a photo album.

340
00:16:19,648 --> 00:16:22,648
I have a favorite cover.

341
00:16:22,648 --> 00:16:25,648
I bought it myself.

342
00:16:25,648 --> 00:16:27,648
I asked KAKI-SAN to sign it.

343
00:16:27,648 --> 00:16:29,648
That's great.

344
00:16:29,648 --> 00:16:32,648
I got it first as a fan.

345
00:16:32,648 --> 00:16:34,648
Is this that?

346
00:16:34,648 --> 00:16:35,648
Yes.

347
00:16:35,648 --> 00:16:37,648
This face is strange.

348
00:16:41,648 --> 00:16:43,648
This is a KAMAKIRI.

349
00:16:43,648 --> 00:16:45,648
Why is everyone in KAMAKIRI MODE?

350
00:16:45,648 --> 00:16:47,648
This face is strange.

351
00:16:47,648 --> 00:16:49,648
I took a picture from above.

352
00:16:49,648 --> 00:16:51,648
This is the angle of the photo.

353
00:16:51,648 --> 00:16:53,648
This is not KAMAKIRI MODE.

354
00:16:53,648 --> 00:16:55,648
KAMAKIRI MODE is popular.

355
00:16:55,648 --> 00:16:56,648
This is KAKI-SAN.

356
00:16:56,648 --> 00:16:58,648
I got this for the first time.

357
00:16:58,648 --> 00:17:06,648
I was happy that KAKI-SAN bought it and
asked me to sign it.

358
00:17:06,648 --> 00:17:09,648
I have never signed it.

359
00:17:09,648 --> 00:17:11,648
I got it for the first time.

360
00:17:11,648 --> 00:17:12,648
Is this really the first time?

361
00:17:12,648 --> 00:17:14,648
I should sell this.

362
00:17:14,648 --> 00:17:16,648
Please don't.

363
00:17:16,648 --> 00:17:20,648
Do you buy it in the same group?

364
00:17:20,648 --> 00:17:24,648
I buy magazines and magazines.

365
00:17:24,648 --> 00:17:25,648
Do you buy that too?

366
00:17:25,648 --> 00:17:29,648
You have a lot of NOGIZAKA goods in your
room.

367
00:17:29,648 --> 00:17:32,648
It's dirty and there are too many.

368
00:17:32,648 --> 00:17:35,648
Is it dirty because there are too many
NOGIZAKA goods?

369
00:17:35,648 --> 00:17:37,648
Is it too much?

370
00:17:37,648 --> 00:17:38,648
I bought it yesterday.

371
00:17:38,648 --> 00:17:39,648
I got it cleaned up.

372
00:17:39,648 --> 00:17:40,648
Did you do it on your own?

373
00:17:40,648 --> 00:17:41,648
Yes.

374
00:17:41,648 --> 00:17:43,648
Why did you do it on your own?

375
00:17:43,648 --> 00:17:45,648
It was really dirty.

376
00:17:47,648 --> 00:17:49,648
Why do you buy goods?

377
00:17:49,648 --> 00:17:51,648
I don't buy it because I want to buy it.

378
00:17:51,648 --> 00:17:54,648
I buy it when I leave the convenience
store.

379
00:17:54,648 --> 00:17:56,648
That's amazing.

380
00:17:56,648 --> 00:17:58,648
You are a good excuse.

381
00:17:58,648 --> 00:18:01,648
You don't buy it when you notice it.

382
00:18:01,648 --> 00:18:03,648
Next.

383
00:18:03,648 --> 00:18:05,648
This is a little surprising.

384
00:18:05,648 --> 00:18:08,648
I had a day off.

385
00:18:08,648 --> 00:18:12,648
I went there because I wanted to feel
nature.

386
00:18:12,648 --> 00:18:13,648
Do you go alone?

387
00:18:13,648 --> 00:18:15,648
I like to go alone.

388
00:18:15,648 --> 00:18:17,648
I don't think so.

389
00:18:17,648 --> 00:18:20,648
I have never gone on a trip.

390
00:18:20,648 --> 00:18:21,648
I went there for the first time.

391
00:18:21,648 --> 00:18:22,648
Did you stay there?

392
00:18:22,648 --> 00:18:24,648
I wanted to stay there.

393
00:18:24,648 --> 00:18:29,648
I need a parent under 18.

394
00:18:29,648 --> 00:18:31,648
I can't stay there because it's only
May.

395
00:18:31,648 --> 00:18:33,648
What do you do?

396
00:18:33,648 --> 00:18:35,648
I eat sashimi.

397
00:18:35,648 --> 00:18:36,648
Is that a shibu?

398
00:18:36,648 --> 00:18:38,648
This is a shibu.

399
00:18:38,648 --> 00:18:40,648
This is a shibu.

400
00:18:40,648 --> 00:18:42,648
I went to a restaurant.

401
00:18:42,648 --> 00:18:46,648
I ate NUREOKAKI at the shopping street.

402
00:18:46,648 --> 00:18:49,648
I went to the sea and came back.

403
00:18:49,648 --> 00:18:51,648
That's amazing.

404
00:18:51,648 --> 00:18:54,648
You can drink alcohol.

405
00:18:54,648 --> 00:18:55,648
I want to go there.

406
00:18:55,648 --> 00:18:58,648
Do you want to go abroad alone?

407
00:18:58,648 --> 00:18:59,648
I want to go there.

408
00:18:59,648 --> 00:19:02,648
You are not alone.

409
00:19:02,648 --> 00:19:04,648
I thought so.

410
00:19:04,648 --> 00:19:08,648
I went to karaoke alone.

411
00:19:08,648 --> 00:19:10,648
I often go there.

412
00:19:10,648 --> 00:19:12,648
I see a surprising thing in the B-class
news.

413
00:19:12,648 --> 00:19:17,312
The most surprising thing is that I saw
a black person.

414
00:19:18,312 --> 00:19:22,312
What is this? I'm scared.

415
00:19:22,312 --> 00:19:30,312
I got a small cake as a gift during the
online talk.

416
00:19:30,312 --> 00:19:33,312
Kaede came to my room and said she would
eat it.

417
00:19:33,312 --> 00:19:36,312
I forgot to bring a fork.

418
00:19:36,312 --> 00:19:45,312
I was looking for a long fork in the
room.

419
00:19:45,312 --> 00:19:49,312
I brought a straw and ate it.

420
00:19:49,312 --> 00:19:52,312
I was surprised.

421
00:19:52,312 --> 00:19:59,312
I spilled it.

422
00:19:59,312 --> 00:20:01,312
I drank miso soup with a straw.

423
00:20:01,312 --> 00:20:04,312
You had a picture of that before.

424
00:20:04,312 --> 00:20:07,312
I thought I could do anything with a
straw.

425
00:20:07,312 --> 00:20:11,312
I always have a straw with me.

426
00:20:11,312 --> 00:20:15,312
I don't have a straw.

427
00:20:15,312 --> 00:20:18,312
I often break things I buy.

428
00:20:18,312 --> 00:20:23,312
I went to a shop in Akasaka.

429
00:20:23,312 --> 00:20:25,312
I bought a glass bottle.

430
00:20:25,312 --> 00:20:28,312
I baked cookies and put them in it.

431
00:20:28,312 --> 00:20:30,312
It's cute.

432
00:20:30,312 --> 00:20:35,312
I dropped it in the sink.

433
00:20:35,312 --> 00:20:39,312
It was broken on the day.

434
00:20:39,312 --> 00:20:42,312
I dropped it in the container.

435
00:20:42,312 --> 00:20:44,312
I only have a lid.

436
00:20:44,312 --> 00:20:47,312
I have a lid at home.

437
00:20:47,312 --> 00:20:51,312
You took a picture of this.

438
00:20:51,312 --> 00:20:54,312
You often take pictures after dropping
it.

439
00:20:54,312 --> 00:20:56,312
I'm not good at taking pictures.

440
00:20:56,312 --> 00:21:01,312
I brought it to the desk when I spilled
it.

441
00:21:01,312 --> 00:21:04,312
This is a picture of despair.

442
00:21:04,312 --> 00:21:07,312
This is a good picture.

443
00:21:07,312 --> 00:21:09,312
This is a good picture.

444
00:21:09,312 --> 00:21:14,312
I always make a mistake.

445
00:21:14,312 --> 00:21:16,312
I drop this.

446
00:21:16,312 --> 00:21:20,312
I put this here.

447
00:21:20,312 --> 00:21:22,312
I don't take a picture.

448
00:21:22,312 --> 00:21:25,312
I let go of this.

449
00:21:25,312 --> 00:21:28,312
I pick up something.

450
00:21:28,312 --> 00:21:33,312
What kind of relationship is this?

451
00:21:33,312 --> 00:21:38,312
You moved before I said anything.

452
00:21:38,312 --> 00:21:40,312
I'm careful.

453
00:21:40,312 --> 00:21:41,312
Next.

454
00:21:41,312 --> 00:21:44,312
This is a picture of a house in Shibata.

455
00:21:44,312 --> 00:21:48,312
I often stay with YUNA.

456
00:21:48,312 --> 00:21:52,312
She often talks about her family.

457
00:21:52,312 --> 00:21:55,312
Asuka also said that she likes to talk
about her family.

458
00:21:55,312 --> 00:21:59,312
I don't have anyone to talk to.

459
00:21:59,312 --> 00:22:01,312
I'm lonely when you say that.

460
00:22:01,312 --> 00:22:04,312
I often contact my family.

461
00:22:04,312 --> 00:22:08,312
I always think that my family is kind.

462
00:22:08,312 --> 00:22:11,312
I want to go see my family.

463
00:22:11,312 --> 00:22:15,312
I asked my family to go home after work.

464
00:22:15,312 --> 00:22:17,312
My family said it was okay.

465
00:22:17,312 --> 00:22:21,312
My family welcomed me.

466
00:22:21,312 --> 00:22:23,312
They gave me dinner.

467
00:22:23,312 --> 00:22:26,312
I didn't make dinner, but they gave me
dinner.

468
00:22:26,312 --> 00:22:30,312
I told my mother that I was there.

469
00:22:30,312 --> 00:22:31,312
I made a reservation.

470
00:22:31,312 --> 00:22:36,312
My mother, brother and sister came to my
house.

471
00:22:36,312 --> 00:22:39,312
Your family is very nice.

472
00:22:39,312 --> 00:22:43,312
You should have made a reservation
earlier.

473
00:22:43,312 --> 00:22:45,312
You should have brought souvenirs.

474
00:22:45,312 --> 00:22:47,312
I went there empty-handed.

475
00:22:47,312 --> 00:22:49,312
That's the worst.

476
00:22:49,312 --> 00:22:52,312
I came back with a gift.

477
00:22:52,312 --> 00:22:53,312
It was raining.

478
00:22:53,312 --> 00:22:57,616
After this, it was a dramatic rain.

479
00:22:58,616 --> 00:23:00,616
What is this? It's like a drama.

480
00:23:00,616 --> 00:23:02,616
What is this? It's wonderful.

481
00:23:02,616 --> 00:23:08,616
When I was going to school in the
morning, it was raining a lot, but I
forgot my umbrella.

482
00:23:08,616 --> 00:23:13,616
So I was walking and I fell like I was
in a picture.

483
00:23:13,616 --> 00:23:14,616
It's raining and slippery.

484
00:23:14,616 --> 00:23:15,616
It's dangerous.

485
00:23:15,616 --> 00:23:24,616
I'm embarrassed, but I was walking in
the rain, and a wonderful woman put her
umbrella in my umbrella.

486
00:23:24,616 --> 00:23:30,616
I said, I'm fine, but she said, it's
okay, and gave it to me.

487
00:23:30,616 --> 00:23:32,616
Is that Kuromi?

488
00:23:34,616 --> 00:23:35,616
I didn't say that.

489
00:23:35,616 --> 00:23:37,616
What kind of world is it?

490
00:23:37,616 --> 00:23:38,616
Is that Kuromi?

491
00:23:40,616 --> 00:23:41,616
And she was a kamata.

492
00:23:42,616 --> 00:23:45,616
There's a story like a drama.

493
00:23:45,616 --> 00:23:47,616
I chased after him, but he was gone.

494
00:23:47,616 --> 00:23:48,616
He's not here?

495
00:23:48,616 --> 00:23:50,616
You don't even know his contact
information.

496
00:23:50,616 --> 00:23:51,616
That's right.

497
00:23:51,616 --> 00:23:57,616
And when I went to school for about a
week, I carried my umbrella.

498
00:23:57,616 --> 00:23:59,616
You can meet him anytime.

499
00:23:59,616 --> 00:24:01,616
But I couldn't meet him.

500
00:24:01,616 --> 00:24:05,616
So if I find him, I'd like to give him
my umbrella and thank him.

501
00:24:05,616 --> 00:24:06,616
That's a good story.

502
00:24:06,616 --> 00:24:07,616
Really?

503
00:24:07,616 --> 00:24:08,616
The umbrella you lent me.

504
00:24:08,616 --> 00:24:10,616
It's a real umbrella.

505
00:24:10,616 --> 00:24:11,616
That's right.

506
00:24:11,616 --> 00:24:12,616
Did you give me that umbrella?

507
00:24:12,616 --> 00:24:16,616
I said, I'll buy it now, so it's okay.

508
00:24:16,616 --> 00:24:18,616
That's kind of you.

509
00:24:18,616 --> 00:24:21,616
I'm not sure if I should say this story.

510
00:24:21,616 --> 00:24:22,616
Why?

511
00:24:22,616 --> 00:24:30,616
As a member of Nogizaka, I have to do it
properly, but I made a big mistake of
forgetting the umbrella.

512
00:24:30,616 --> 00:24:33,616
You made a bigger mistake.

513
00:24:33,616 --> 00:24:36,616
You didn't bring an umbrella on a rainy
day.

514
00:24:36,616 --> 00:24:37,616
It's okay.

515
00:24:37,616 --> 00:24:39,616
If anyone who saw this.

516
00:24:39,616 --> 00:24:40,616
I'd like to get this.

517
00:24:40,616 --> 00:24:41,616
I'll take it.

518
00:24:41,616 --> 00:24:42,616
Let's give it back.

519
00:24:42,616 --> 00:24:44,616
It's amazing. It's like a drama.

520
00:24:44,616 --> 00:24:46,616
There are some wonderful women.

521
00:24:46,616 --> 00:24:48,616
I've never had an umbrella on a rainy
day.

522
00:24:48,616 --> 00:24:50,616
That's a good story.

523
00:24:50,616 --> 00:24:52,616
I think I'll be in the A class forever.

524
00:24:53,616 --> 00:24:55,616
