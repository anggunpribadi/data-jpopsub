1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
with a bang

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Happy New Year!

3
00:00:14,490 --> 00:00:21,490
I'm Bananaman of the JC world.

4
00:00:21,490 --> 00:00:23,490
I'm Bananaman of the JC world.

5
00:00:23,490 --> 00:00:25,490
Thank you for listening. This is Morisaka-chan.

6
00:00:28,490 --> 00:00:30,490
Thank you very much.

7
00:00:30,490 --> 00:00:32,490
What is it?

8
00:00:32,490 --> 00:00:34,490
What's going on?

9
00:00:34,490 --> 00:00:36,490
What are you doing?

10
00:00:36,490 --> 00:00:38,490
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

11
00:00:41,288 --> 00:00:43,288
Ready, B!

12
00:00:43,288 --> 00:00:46,288
Yes, that's what I'm talking about, B.

13
00:00:46,288 --> 00:00:47,288
I see. That's how it works.

14
00:00:47,288 --> 00:00:50,288
Himechan, please announce today's project.

15
00:00:50,288 --> 00:00:54,288
Let's look back at the year 2022!

16
00:00:54,288 --> 00:00:57,288
Let's look back on the year 2022!

17
00:01:01,288 --> 00:01:04,288
Last year, we had a lot of news to share with the world.

18
00:01:04,288 --> 00:01:06,288
Nogizaka46

19
00:01:06,288 --> 00:01:09,288
Let's take a look at some of the news that happened to the members of Nogizaka46

20
00:01:09,288 --> 00:01:12,288
Let's take a look at some very small news that happened unnoticed by the public.

21
00:01:13,648 --> 00:01:19,208
First, let's take a look at the Nogizaka B News from January to March

22
00:01:20,328 --> 00:01:22,328
Akimoto, Yaku cap hates me

23
00:01:23,328 --> 00:01:25,328
Umezawa, bananas and wet ice

24
00:01:27,328 --> 00:01:29,328
Kubo's eyebrows are leaking

25
00:01:30,328 --> 00:01:32,328
Endo finds just the right mug

26
00:01:34,328 --> 00:01:36,328
Nakamura, connected when he fell down

27
00:01:38,328 --> 00:01:40,328
Umezawa cries with her dad

28
00:01:40,328 --> 00:01:46,328
That's all for January through March.

29
00:02:10,328 --> 00:02:12,328
I was giving away clothes and stuff like that.

30
00:02:12,328 --> 00:02:14,328
That's what I was doing.

31
00:02:14,328 --> 00:02:16,328
There's no reason for them to hate me.

32
00:02:16,328 --> 00:02:19,328
I don't even use the group email anymore.

33
00:02:19,328 --> 00:02:20,328
So you haven't moved since then.

34
00:02:20,328 --> 00:02:22,328
I haven't used it once.

35
00:02:22,328 --> 00:02:26,328
I should have done it before a concert or something.

36
00:02:26,328 --> 00:02:29,328
I was afraid you'd think I was lying about it.

37
00:02:29,328 --> 00:02:30,328
I gave it away a little bit.

38
00:02:30,328 --> 00:02:32,328
It's just a project, after all.

39
00:02:32,328 --> 00:02:37,328
I'd like to apologize personally to Yakuhat-chan and the others who were at the pinpoint of the project, and I'd like to apologize to them.

40
00:02:37,328 --> 00:02:41,328
I sent them a message saying that I did it because it was part of the project, but that I really wanted to give them the clothes.

41
00:02:41,328 --> 00:02:43,328
I sent her a message saying that I was sorry.

42
00:02:43,328 --> 00:02:46,328
I haven't read it for a few months.

43
00:02:46,328 --> 00:02:47,328
You haven't read it?

44
00:02:47,328 --> 00:02:48,328
Yes, I'm going unread.

45
00:02:48,328 --> 00:02:49,328
I didn't even read it.

46
00:02:49,328 --> 00:02:50,328
Yes, I haven't even read it.

47
00:02:50,328 --> 00:02:51,328
What?

48
00:02:51,328 --> 00:02:53,328
I thought maybe I got lost.

49
00:02:53,328 --> 00:02:58,328
Then, about two months later, I sent an email to Yakuhat-chan for something else.

50
00:02:58,328 --> 00:03:00,328
And she responded.

51
00:03:00,328 --> 00:03:01,328
That's a very long message.

52
00:03:01,328 --> 00:03:03,328
That was January 20th.

53
00:03:03,328 --> 00:03:04,328
Yes.

54
00:03:04,328 --> 00:03:05,328
And the next...

55
00:03:05,328 --> 00:03:06,328
March.

56
00:03:06,328 --> 00:03:07,328
March.

57
00:03:07,328 --> 00:03:09,328
The MC was really good, Yakuhat-chan!

58
00:03:09,328 --> 00:03:13,328
So I sent a message to tell her how great it was.

59
00:03:13,328 --> 00:03:15,328
I got a reply on the same day.

60
00:03:15,328 --> 00:03:17,328
I got a reply.

61
00:03:17,328 --> 00:03:18,328
Please listen to me.

62
00:03:18,328 --> 00:03:20,328
No, of course I'll listen.

63
00:03:20,328 --> 00:03:21,328
Of course I do.

64
00:03:21,328 --> 00:03:22,328
What's this?

65
00:03:22,328 --> 00:03:27,328
I'm the kind of person who accumulates correspondence... from all sorts of people.

66
00:03:27,328 --> 00:03:31,328
I don't even notice them until March.

67
00:03:31,328 --> 00:03:32,328
But you know what?

68
00:03:32,328 --> 00:03:34,328
How many are buried?

69
00:03:34,328 --> 00:03:36,328
I don't know, a hundred or so.

70
00:03:36,328 --> 00:03:37,328
I don't know.

71
00:03:37,328 --> 00:03:39,328
I mean, how many are buried?

72
00:03:39,328 --> 00:03:40,328
I don't see them on line.

73
00:03:40,328 --> 00:03:44,328
They're getting mixed up with all the official coupons.

74
00:03:44,328 --> 00:03:48,328
But... how many coupons do you get?

75
00:03:48,328 --> 00:03:50,328
With all those buried coupons...

76
00:03:50,328 --> 00:03:51,328
I get a lot of coupons.

77
00:03:51,328 --> 00:03:56,328
But Akimoto, you know, he's the captain of Nogizaka, the senior member of Nogizaka.

78
00:03:56,328 --> 00:03:59,328
Coupon and I, Coupon beat me.

79
00:03:59,328 --> 00:04:02,328
He beat me to the coupon thing.

80
00:04:02,328 --> 00:04:07,328
Are there other members who sent in coupons but never got read?

81
00:04:07,328 --> 00:04:08,328
I didn't know that.

82
00:04:08,328 --> 00:04:11,328
In my case, it was recorded.

83
00:04:11,328 --> 00:04:13,328
I don't know how many days it will take to get back to me.

84
00:04:13,328 --> 00:04:16,328
That's perfect... four days.

85
00:04:16,328 --> 00:04:19,328
The town hall's scary.

86
00:04:19,328 --> 00:04:23,328
You're so cool for a guy who calls himself "Saki, Saki, Saki.

87
00:04:23,328 --> 00:04:24,328
That's scary.

88
00:04:24,328 --> 00:04:26,328
Okay, next, Yume...

89
00:04:26,328 --> 00:04:28,328
Bananas and camre...

90
00:04:28,328 --> 00:04:33,328
I was really into Kamure from '21 to '22.

91
00:04:33,328 --> 00:04:35,328
Kamure was really popular, right?

92
00:04:35,328 --> 00:04:38,328
Yes, but I was into it even before it became popular.

93
00:04:38,328 --> 00:04:40,328
I really was.

94
00:04:40,328 --> 00:04:43,328
But there are people who are like that.

95
00:04:43,328 --> 00:04:47,328
When my family says it's good, people say it's a fad.

96
00:04:47,328 --> 00:04:53,328
I don't usually watch it, but when I do, the Japanese national team wins.

97
00:04:53,328 --> 00:04:55,328
It's just like that.

98
00:04:55,328 --> 00:04:58,328
And around June, I think, Bananaman did a radio show.

99
00:04:58,328 --> 00:05:00,328
Bananaman did a radio show called "Kamure Kassen," right?

100
00:05:00,328 --> 00:05:05,328
He said, "Did we really buy that?

101
00:05:05,328 --> 00:05:10,328
June, that's really late!

102
00:05:10,328 --> 00:05:13,328
Yes, we were listening to it, and during the recording.

103
00:05:13,328 --> 00:05:16,328
I gave him a quick recommendation for kamure.

104
00:05:16,328 --> 00:05:17,328
I didn't eat it!

105
00:05:17,328 --> 00:05:18,328
You said that on the recording?

106
00:05:18,328 --> 00:05:19,328
Yes, I did!

107
00:05:19,328 --> 00:05:21,328
Yes, yes, yes...

108
00:05:21,328 --> 00:05:22,328
Why do you say that?

109
00:05:22,328 --> 00:05:23,328
You have to give it to me.

110
00:05:23,328 --> 00:05:26,328
That's right... that's why we prepared it today.

111
00:05:26,328 --> 00:05:31,328
If I'm lying... there was one we recommended.

112
00:05:31,328 --> 00:05:34,328
That's because I've been wanting to interact with you.

113
00:05:34,328 --> 00:05:36,328
I've been wanting to interact with you, too, so now...

114
00:05:36,328 --> 00:05:37,328
This...

115
00:05:37,328 --> 00:05:40,328
This is a kamure only in Hokkaido.

116
00:05:40,328 --> 00:05:43,328
There are no stores in the Kanto region, so I order it from them.

117
00:05:43,328 --> 00:05:45,328
You're ordering it?

118
00:05:45,328 --> 00:05:48,328
Yes, I've been ordering it, and it's my favorite.

119
00:05:48,328 --> 00:05:51,328
I like the pudding-like texture with a crunchy texture and soft inside.

120
00:05:51,328 --> 00:05:53,328
I like the pudding-like texture.

121
00:05:53,328 --> 00:05:55,328
I think it's the ultimate.

122
00:05:55,328 --> 00:05:56,328
I know.

123
00:05:56,328 --> 00:05:59,584
I'll eat it.

124
00:06:00,344 --> 00:06:02,344
It's so good!

125
00:06:03,764 --> 00:06:05,764
You're right... it's pudding inside.

126
00:06:05,764 --> 00:06:06,764
It's pudding inside.

127
00:06:06,764 --> 00:06:07,264
Is it that good?

128
00:06:07,264 --> 00:06:08,264
It's good.

129
00:06:08,264 --> 00:06:08,764
Yeah, it's good.

130
00:06:08,764 --> 00:06:10,764
Oh, it's so crunchy.

131
00:06:10,764 --> 00:06:12,764
It's so good in there.

132
00:06:12,764 --> 00:06:13,764
It's so good.

133
00:06:13,764 --> 00:06:15,264
This is totally different.

134
00:06:15,264 --> 00:06:15,764
It's delicious.

135
00:06:15,764 --> 00:06:17,764
How many packages have you eaten, by the way?

136
00:06:17,764 --> 00:06:20,264
By the way, how many have you eaten this year?

137
00:06:20,264 --> 00:06:21,264
I bet you've eaten a hundred.

138
00:06:21,264 --> 00:06:22,264
Oh, my God.

139
00:06:22,264 --> 00:06:22,764
Really?

140
00:06:22,764 --> 00:06:23,764
That's a lot!

141
00:06:23,764 --> 00:06:25,264
I guess they're getting bigger and bigger.

142
00:06:25,264 --> 00:06:26,264
I'll see you later.

143
00:06:26,264 --> 00:06:27,264
No, no, no, no...

144
00:06:27,264 --> 00:06:28,264
Wait a minute.

145
00:06:28,264 --> 00:06:29,264
Delicious.

146
00:06:29,264 --> 00:06:30,264
Go on, then.

147
00:06:30,264 --> 00:06:31,264
Ugh!

148
00:06:31,264 --> 00:06:32,264
What's this?

149
00:06:32,264 --> 00:06:36,264
I'm doing a morning show this February.

150
00:06:36,264 --> 00:06:39,264
We had to make a video for the survey.

151
00:06:39,264 --> 00:06:42,264
So we had to get some of the members to appear on the show.

152
00:06:42,264 --> 00:06:45,264
Umezawa, Yamashita and I shot the video together.

153
00:06:45,264 --> 00:06:47,264
And the questionnaire was sent in at the last minute.

154
00:06:47,264 --> 00:06:49,264
We sent it in without checking it.

155
00:06:49,264 --> 00:06:52,264
We were using an app to take the video.

156
00:06:52,264 --> 00:06:54,264
What did I do wrong?

157
00:06:54,264 --> 00:06:56,264
In the app's settings...

158
00:06:56,264 --> 00:06:58,264
The eyebrows are set to the darkest setting.

159
00:06:58,264 --> 00:06:59,264
Is there such a thing?

160
00:06:59,264 --> 00:07:00,264
Yes, there is.

161
00:07:00,264 --> 00:07:03,264
I took the photo in that state and sent it without realizing it.

162
00:07:03,264 --> 00:07:05,264
It was broadcast on live TV.

163
00:07:05,264 --> 00:07:06,264
On live TV.

164
00:07:06,264 --> 00:07:07,264
It was broadcast live.

165
00:07:07,264 --> 00:07:08,264
That's scary.

166
00:07:08,264 --> 00:07:09,264
I have some video of it.

167
00:07:09,264 --> 00:07:10,264
I saw it.

168
00:07:10,264 --> 00:07:17,264
It's a little scary.

169
00:07:17,264 --> 00:07:21,264
Both Ume and Yamashita are caught in the fire!

170
00:07:21,264 --> 00:07:22,264
Oh my God!

171
00:07:22,264 --> 00:07:23,264
This got broadcast!

172
00:07:23,264 --> 00:07:25,264
I was watching the live broadcast.

173
00:07:25,264 --> 00:07:28,264
I thought something had happened.

174
00:07:28,264 --> 00:07:30,264
I mean... the manager...

175
00:07:30,264 --> 00:07:32,264
I'm sure they were checking on me.

176
00:07:32,264 --> 00:07:34,264
But the audience and the MC...

177
00:07:34,264 --> 00:07:36,264
I didn't get any comments from the audience or the MCs.

178
00:07:36,264 --> 00:07:38,264
Even the fans didn't comment on it.

179
00:07:38,264 --> 00:07:39,264
We've been doing it all this time.

180
00:07:39,264 --> 00:07:41,264
The three of us are doing it.

181
00:07:41,264 --> 00:07:43,264
They think it's just the latest eyebrows, if that's what it is.

182
00:07:43,264 --> 00:07:44,264
I don't know.

183
00:07:44,264 --> 00:07:47,264
I mean, they're on top of the bangs.

184
00:07:47,264 --> 00:07:49,264
But I don't know... I've had a lot of eyebrow jobs...

185
00:07:49,264 --> 00:07:50,264
I didn't get a lot of eyebrow jobs after this.

186
00:07:50,264 --> 00:07:51,264
It's on top of my eyebrows.

187
00:07:51,264 --> 00:07:53,264
Be careful. - I'll be careful.

188
00:07:53,264 --> 00:07:54,264
I'll be careful.

189
00:07:54,264 --> 00:07:56,264
That's pretty urgent, isn't it?

190
00:07:56,264 --> 00:07:58,264
You're right, it's funny.

191
00:07:58,264 --> 00:08:00,264
Now, on to the end.

192
00:08:00,264 --> 00:08:02,264
I really don't care about this.

193
00:08:02,264 --> 00:08:03,264
What the hell?

194
00:08:03,264 --> 00:08:04,264
I'm sorry.

195
00:08:04,264 --> 00:08:08,264
The year before last, we had a year-end party in Nogizaka.

196
00:08:08,264 --> 00:08:11,264
When Ikuta-san graduated.

197
00:08:11,264 --> 00:08:13,264
At that hotel.

198
00:08:13,264 --> 00:08:17,264
This is the mug I won during the game.

199
00:08:17,264 --> 00:08:18,264
There it is.

200
00:08:18,264 --> 00:08:19,264
I wrote "Ron Ikuta" on it.

201
00:08:19,264 --> 00:08:20,264
Yes, that's right.

202
00:08:20,264 --> 00:08:21,264
I use this.

203
00:08:21,264 --> 00:08:22,264
Wow, it's true.

204
00:08:22,264 --> 00:08:24,264
That's disgusting.

205
00:08:24,264 --> 00:08:26,264
What did you drink?

206
00:08:26,264 --> 00:08:28,264
I drank coffee.

207
00:08:28,264 --> 00:08:29,264
It's pretty easy to use.

208
00:08:29,264 --> 00:08:30,264
Oh, yeah.

209
00:08:30,264 --> 00:08:32,264
You say you love this cup.

210
00:08:32,264 --> 00:08:34,264
How can you make such a cute face with this cup?

211
00:08:34,264 --> 00:08:36,264
But it's kind of nice.

212
00:08:36,264 --> 00:08:37,264
I'm using this one.

213
00:08:37,264 --> 00:08:38,264
But mine...

214
00:08:38,264 --> 00:08:40,264
I don't use the Ikuta one that you wrote.

215
00:08:40,264 --> 00:08:43,264
It's too intimidating.

216
00:08:43,264 --> 00:08:46,264
But you're right-handed, right?

217
00:08:46,264 --> 00:08:49,264
If you hold it with your right hand, you can't see it.

218
00:08:49,264 --> 00:08:52,264
But it's a little intimidating.

219
00:08:52,264 --> 00:08:57,264
Well, well... it's like a god living in the toilet.

220
00:08:57,264 --> 00:08:59,264
Alive and kicking.

221
00:08:59,264 --> 00:09:02,264
When my friends come over, I don't let them out.

222
00:09:02,264 --> 00:09:04,264
No, I don't.

223
00:09:04,264 --> 00:09:05,264
He uses it alone.

224
00:09:05,264 --> 00:09:07,264
Next, this one.

225
00:09:07,264 --> 00:09:08,264
What's this?

226
00:09:08,264 --> 00:09:10,264
That's me.

227
00:09:10,264 --> 00:09:15,264
Last year, me, Kazuki Mukai, and Nawa Yumiki...

228
00:09:15,264 --> 00:09:17,264
Me, Kazuki Mukai, and Nawa Yumiki starred in a drama together.

229
00:09:17,264 --> 00:09:18,264
Something like that?

230
00:09:18,264 --> 00:09:21,264
That's right.

231
00:09:21,264 --> 00:09:23,264
We were filming at school.

232
00:09:23,264 --> 00:09:28,264
I was supposed to join the filming later, but they would get mad at me, so I ran to the set as fast as I could.

233
00:09:28,264 --> 00:09:32,264
So I ran to the set and said good morning.

234
00:09:32,264 --> 00:09:34,264
There was some kind of pit.

235
00:09:34,264 --> 00:09:39,264
I got stuck in one of the pits and got seriously injured.

236
00:09:39,264 --> 00:09:42,264
Wait a minute... what kind of situation is that?

237
00:09:42,264 --> 00:09:44,264
It's not a surprise.

238
00:09:44,264 --> 00:09:47,264
It's a natural pit.

239
00:09:47,264 --> 00:09:50,264
It was Nawa Yumiki, right?

240
00:09:50,264 --> 00:09:53,264
I've been told I look like I work at a construction site.

241
00:09:53,264 --> 00:09:54,264
I don't think so.

242
00:09:54,264 --> 00:09:55,264
Not at all.

243
00:09:55,264 --> 00:09:56,264
I don't think so.

244
00:09:56,264 --> 00:09:59,264
Dramas have connections, don't they?

245
00:09:59,264 --> 00:10:01,264
I was in uniform, so my knees are showing.

246
00:10:01,264 --> 00:10:03,264
I didn't know what to do.

247
00:10:03,264 --> 00:10:07,264
But it just so happened that I played a character who was getting dv'd.

248
00:10:07,264 --> 00:10:08,264
Oh!

249
00:10:08,264 --> 00:10:11,264
That's why we connected so well.

250
00:10:11,264 --> 00:10:14,264
I didn't have to hurt him.

251
00:10:14,264 --> 00:10:16,264
That's how we connected.

252
00:10:16,264 --> 00:10:17,264
That's right.

253
00:10:17,264 --> 00:10:19,264
You're all dv'd on your knees.

254
00:10:19,264 --> 00:10:21,264
Knees, knees, knees...

255
00:10:21,264 --> 00:10:27,264
Don't go for the knees, don't go for the knees, don't go for the knees.

256
00:10:27,264 --> 00:10:29,264
It's for the sake of connection.

257
00:10:29,264 --> 00:10:35,264
But in this drama, Hazuki and I both have knee injuries.

258
00:10:35,264 --> 00:10:38,264
And Hazuki got called in by the director.

259
00:10:38,264 --> 00:10:41,264
I didn't want to get mad at her, so I ran towards her.

260
00:10:41,264 --> 00:10:43,264
Then she thought she'd get mad and ran too fast.

261
00:10:43,264 --> 00:10:46,264
I fell down.

262
00:10:46,264 --> 00:10:48,264
And then she came out with a boom.

263
00:10:48,264 --> 00:10:52,264
And then the female supervisor got mad at me.

264
00:10:52,264 --> 00:10:54,264
What the hell kind of move is that?

265
00:10:54,264 --> 00:10:56,264
I told her that it would make the drama unconnected.

266
00:10:56,264 --> 00:11:00,264
I wasn't the one getting dv'd.

267
00:11:00,264 --> 00:11:02,264
What kind of role is that?

268
00:11:02,264 --> 00:11:04,264
What kind of leading lady are you?

269
00:11:04,264 --> 00:11:07,264
Three sisters with dirty knees.

270
00:11:07,264 --> 00:11:09,264
Next...

271
00:11:09,264 --> 00:11:10,264
This one caught my attention.

272
00:11:10,264 --> 00:11:11,264
What's this all about?

273
00:11:11,264 --> 00:11:14,264
I'm close with my family and we often make video calls.

274
00:11:14,264 --> 00:11:18,264
My brother was about to start his freshman year of high school in April.

275
00:11:18,264 --> 00:11:21,264
I congratulated him and wished him good luck.

276
00:11:21,264 --> 00:11:25,264
But now that he's gone, my father and I were talking on the phone.

277
00:11:25,264 --> 00:11:28,264
He started talking about my brother's aging.

278
00:11:28,264 --> 00:11:31,264
He's a really nice guy.

279
00:11:31,264 --> 00:11:33,264
And my dad started saying...

280
00:11:33,264 --> 00:11:34,264
That's amazing.

281
00:11:34,264 --> 00:11:36,264
He's a really good kid.

282
00:11:36,264 --> 00:11:39,264
He said he was a really good kid when he was a little kid.

283
00:11:39,264 --> 00:11:42,264
I was telling him about how he was a really good kid when he was little, and he started acting weird.

284
00:11:42,264 --> 00:11:44,264
His face didn't look so good anymore.

285
00:11:44,264 --> 00:11:46,264
He's so cute.

286
00:11:46,264 --> 00:11:48,264
His face would fall off.

287
00:11:48,264 --> 00:11:52,264
I thought he was crying, and I started crying, too.

288
00:11:52,264 --> 00:11:54,264
We hid it from each other.

289
00:11:54,264 --> 00:11:55,264
But you can hear it in her voice.

290
00:11:55,264 --> 00:11:57,264
I mean, I'd be shaking.

291
00:11:57,264 --> 00:11:59,264
He's a good guy, right?

292
00:12:01,264 --> 00:12:04,264
I heard it from my grandmother.

293
00:12:04,264 --> 00:12:05,264
My grandmother.

294
00:12:06,264 --> 00:12:08,264
You have a grandfather too?

295
00:12:08,264 --> 00:12:12,264
My grandmother told me stories about my brother when he was little.

296
00:12:12,264 --> 00:12:13,264
It's really hot.

297
00:12:13,264 --> 00:12:14,264
You didn't record that?

298
00:12:14,264 --> 00:12:15,264
No.

299
00:12:15,264 --> 00:12:17,264
Why don't you have it on tape?

300
00:12:17,264 --> 00:12:19,264
I'm pretty sure I didn't.

301
00:12:19,264 --> 00:12:21,264
But he was a really nice kid.

302
00:12:21,264 --> 00:12:23,264
He was about four years old.

303
00:12:23,264 --> 00:12:25,264
He was just a friend of mine, so my parents...

304
00:12:25,264 --> 00:12:28,264
We used to spend a lot of time at my grandma's house.

305
00:12:28,264 --> 00:12:29,264
And he was about four years old, and...

306
00:12:29,264 --> 00:12:32,264
When grandma came home from shopping at night

307
00:12:32,264 --> 00:12:34,264
She would usually say, "Welcome home.

308
00:12:34,264 --> 00:12:35,264
A four year old says, "You must be tired, Grandma.

309
00:12:35,264 --> 00:12:39,264
"You must be tired, Grandma.

310
00:12:39,264 --> 00:12:42,608
What can I say?

311
00:12:42,608 --> 00:12:46,608
That's too much of a turn-off for me.

312
00:12:46,608 --> 00:12:48,608
That's just the beginning.

313
00:12:48,608 --> 00:12:50,608
That episode.

314
00:12:50,608 --> 00:12:51,608
She's a good girl.

315
00:12:51,608 --> 00:12:52,608
She's a good kid, but...

316
00:12:52,608 --> 00:12:54,608
But I thought he was pretty straight-laced growing up.

317
00:12:54,608 --> 00:12:56,608
Did you grow up straight?

318
00:12:56,608 --> 00:12:57,608
I'm so happy.

319
00:12:57,608 --> 00:12:58,608
Can you turn off the camera?

320
00:12:58,608 --> 00:12:59,608
Camera burn, please.

321
00:13:01,608 --> 00:13:04,608
Here is the BQ news from April to June

322
00:13:06,608 --> 00:13:08,608
Kuromin is about to become an idol

323
00:13:08,608 --> 00:13:10,608
No, no, no, I am an idol!

324
00:13:10,608 --> 00:13:12,608
I'm going to be the first of the top 3 idols!

325
00:13:12,608 --> 00:13:13,608
What? Who?

326
00:13:13,608 --> 00:13:15,608
The only one who eats Tsutsumi's food.

327
00:13:15,608 --> 00:13:17,608
What? By herself?

328
00:13:17,608 --> 00:13:20,608
He ate the cake with the sugar.

329
00:13:20,608 --> 00:13:21,608
What? That's scary.

330
00:13:21,608 --> 00:13:24,608
Katsushida welcomes you with his whole family.

331
00:13:24,608 --> 00:13:25,608
What? What? What?

332
00:13:25,608 --> 00:13:28,608
It's Abe's morning, like the Ogawa drama.

333
00:13:28,608 --> 00:13:29,608
What?

334
00:13:29,608 --> 00:13:32,608
That's the Nogizaka BQ news from April to June.

335
00:13:32,608 --> 00:13:33,608
Oh, no...

336
00:13:34,608 --> 00:13:35,608
Go to the next one.

337
00:13:35,608 --> 00:13:36,608
Okay.

338
00:13:36,608 --> 00:13:38,608
What, you're not an idol anymore? Kuroomine

339
00:13:38,608 --> 00:13:39,608
What's going on?

340
00:13:39,608 --> 00:13:42,608
Actually, I started college in April.

341
00:13:42,608 --> 00:13:45,608
There was a welcome party for new students.

342
00:13:45,608 --> 00:13:48,608
I'm making an idol group here at the university.

343
00:13:48,608 --> 00:13:49,608
Would you like to join our circle?

344
00:13:49,608 --> 00:13:51,608
Who?

345
00:13:51,608 --> 00:13:55,608
But you see, Kuromi's cute, so she asked me after all.

346
00:13:55,608 --> 00:13:56,608
Is that a thing?

347
00:13:56,608 --> 00:13:58,608
You're not in it, are you?

348
00:13:58,608 --> 00:14:02,608
You're going to do it.

349
00:14:02,608 --> 00:14:04,608
You're going to teach him something.

350
00:14:04,608 --> 00:14:05,608
It's not like that.

351
00:14:05,608 --> 00:14:07,608
No, no, he's gonna do it.

352
00:14:07,608 --> 00:14:11,608
You're not going to go back to being a senior, are you?

353
00:14:11,608 --> 00:14:12,608
I'm fine.

354
00:14:12,608 --> 00:14:13,608
So you got invited?

355
00:14:13,608 --> 00:14:15,608
They invited me. They even sent me a flyer.

356
00:14:15,608 --> 00:14:18,608
I said I'd think about it and left.

357
00:14:18,608 --> 00:14:23,608
But Miyu Matsuo told me to go dance in the center.

358
00:14:23,608 --> 00:14:26,608
What are you going to do?

359
00:14:26,608 --> 00:14:28,608
That's the end of the line.

360
00:14:28,608 --> 00:14:29,608
And then there was this amazing girl.

361
00:14:29,608 --> 00:14:31,608
Nogizaka's not good enough.

362
00:14:31,608 --> 00:14:33,608
I'm going to go into student wrestling.

363
00:14:33,608 --> 00:14:37,608
I'm going to college.

364
00:14:37,608 --> 00:14:40,608
There's one more thing.

365
00:14:40,608 --> 00:14:45,608
There's a photo of me in the student chapter that's gone viral.

366
00:14:45,608 --> 00:14:47,608
What do you mean?

367
00:14:47,608 --> 00:14:48,608
I want to see it.

368
00:14:48,608 --> 00:14:49,608
I want to see it.

369
00:14:49,608 --> 00:14:50,608
Wow!

370
00:14:50,608 --> 00:14:51,608
What the hell?

371
00:14:51,608 --> 00:14:54,608
Oh, my God, that's disgusting and scary.

372
00:14:54,608 --> 00:14:55,608
Oh, come on.

373
00:14:55,608 --> 00:14:56,608
What is that?

374
00:14:56,608 --> 00:15:01,608
What is this? This is some kind of skull found and then fleshed out.

375
00:15:01,608 --> 00:15:04,608
This is the kind of thing they do with an app.

376
00:15:04,608 --> 00:15:06,608
That's too much!

377
00:15:06,608 --> 00:15:10,608
The machine tweaked it on its own.

378
00:15:10,608 --> 00:15:12,608
What's wrong with the skin?

379
00:15:12,608 --> 00:15:15,608
It's nothing like that.

380
00:15:15,608 --> 00:15:17,608
I didn't do it myself.

381
00:15:17,608 --> 00:15:21,608
You're right, it's not that different.

382
00:15:21,608 --> 00:15:25,608
The pretty heart on her face is not that thin.

383
00:15:25,608 --> 00:15:29,608
It's a scythe cut, isn't it?

384
00:15:29,608 --> 00:15:31,608
It's funny, but...

385
00:15:31,608 --> 00:15:33,608
You put it in sickle-cutting mode.

386
00:15:33,608 --> 00:15:35,608
Why did you put it in sickle-cutting mode?

387
00:15:35,608 --> 00:15:37,608
Because you put it in sickle-cutting mode.

388
00:15:37,608 --> 00:15:39,608
I told you not to put it in sickle-cutting mode.

389
00:15:39,608 --> 00:15:43,608
That's in the picture, but this is what it looks like.

390
00:15:43,608 --> 00:15:45,608
Try this picture on your passport.

391
00:15:45,608 --> 00:15:47,608
You can't get into any foreign country.

392
00:15:47,608 --> 00:15:48,608
It's true.

393
00:15:48,608 --> 00:15:49,608
Who are you using it for?

394
00:15:49,608 --> 00:15:51,608
Only in the central countries.

395
00:15:51,608 --> 00:15:53,608
Why are you using it?

396
00:15:53,608 --> 00:15:55,608
I like chrome.

397
00:15:55,608 --> 00:15:56,608
Chrome's been great lately.

398
00:15:56,608 --> 00:15:59,608
I want my favorite idol group to be in it.

399
00:15:59,608 --> 00:16:03,632
April is just a chrome?

400
00:16:03,632 --> 00:16:05,632
What, he's in charge of April all by himself?

401
00:16:05,632 --> 00:16:07,632
He's so strong.

402
00:16:07,632 --> 00:16:09,632
I'm sorry, I'm sorry for all the other Aprils.

403
00:16:09,632 --> 00:16:11,632
Go on, then.

404
00:16:11,632 --> 00:16:13,632
Who's this?

405
00:16:13,632 --> 00:16:15,632
What's this about?

406
00:16:15,632 --> 00:16:19,632
Kaki-san published a photo book.

407
00:16:19,632 --> 00:16:22,632
I saw a cover I really liked.

408
00:16:22,632 --> 00:16:25,632
I bought it myself.

409
00:16:25,632 --> 00:16:27,632
Please sign it for me, Kaki-san.

410
00:16:27,632 --> 00:16:29,632
Wow, that's great!

411
00:16:29,632 --> 00:16:32,632
I think I was the first fan to get it.

412
00:16:32,632 --> 00:16:34,632
I see.

413
00:16:34,632 --> 00:16:36,632
Is this it?

414
00:16:36,632 --> 00:16:38,632
What's wrong with his face?

415
00:16:38,632 --> 00:16:40,632
What the hell is this?

416
00:16:40,632 --> 00:16:42,632
What the hell is this?

417
00:16:42,632 --> 00:16:44,632
We're all in stink-eye mode.

418
00:16:44,632 --> 00:16:46,632
Why are they all in Kamakiri mode?

419
00:16:46,632 --> 00:16:48,632
What's wrong with his face?

420
00:16:48,632 --> 00:16:50,632
I took this from above.

421
00:16:50,632 --> 00:16:52,632
Maybe it's the angle.

422
00:16:52,632 --> 00:16:54,632
You're not in "kamakiri" mode, are you?

423
00:16:54,632 --> 00:16:56,632
Kamakiri mode is all the rage.

424
00:16:56,632 --> 00:16:58,632
It was my first photo book.

425
00:16:58,632 --> 00:17:00,632
You can't be serious.

426
00:17:00,632 --> 00:17:02,632
That's why I bought it.

427
00:17:02,632 --> 00:17:04,632
and said, "I want you to write about it here.

428
00:17:04,632 --> 00:17:06,632
I was really happy that he said that.

429
00:17:06,632 --> 00:17:08,632
But I had never written anything before.

430
00:17:08,632 --> 00:17:10,632
It's really the first one.

431
00:17:10,632 --> 00:17:12,632
The very first?

432
00:17:12,632 --> 00:17:14,632
Seriously?

433
00:17:14,632 --> 00:17:16,632
Please don't do that.

434
00:17:16,632 --> 00:17:18,632
That's amazing.

435
00:17:18,632 --> 00:17:20,632
Do you buy it for yourself in the same group?

436
00:17:20,632 --> 00:17:22,632
Or maybe it's a magazine or a boys' magazine or something.

437
00:17:22,632 --> 00:17:24,632
Granted magazines.

438
00:17:24,632 --> 00:17:26,632
You buy those too?

439
00:17:26,632 --> 00:17:28,632
So maybe he has his own room...

440
00:17:28,632 --> 00:17:30,632
Maybe he has some of those.

441
00:17:30,632 --> 00:17:32,632
But it's really messy.

442
00:17:32,632 --> 00:17:34,632
Too many Nogizaka goods?

443
00:17:34,632 --> 00:17:36,632
Too much.

444
00:17:36,632 --> 00:17:38,632
He also buys boys' magazines.

445
00:17:38,632 --> 00:17:40,632
I asked him to clean it up.

446
00:17:40,632 --> 00:17:42,632
By Ogawa?

447
00:17:42,632 --> 00:17:44,632
Why Ogawa? He's so much younger than me.

448
00:17:44,632 --> 00:17:46,632
It was really messy.

449
00:17:46,632 --> 00:17:48,632
Why do you buy goods?

450
00:17:48,632 --> 00:17:50,632
It's not that I wanted to buy them.

451
00:17:50,632 --> 00:17:52,632
It's more like when I'm walking out of the convenience store.

452
00:17:52,632 --> 00:17:54,632
I'm in.

453
00:17:54,632 --> 00:17:56,632
That's great.

454
00:17:56,632 --> 00:17:58,632
It's like the three of them have an excuse.

455
00:17:58,632 --> 00:18:00,632
I don't want them to come in when they notice.

456
00:18:00,632 --> 00:18:02,632
Now, on to the next one.

457
00:18:02,632 --> 00:18:04,632
This is a bit of a surprise.

458
00:18:04,632 --> 00:18:06,632
I had the whole day off.

459
00:18:06,632 --> 00:18:08,632
I wanted to feel nature.

460
00:18:08,632 --> 00:18:10,632
I went there.

461
00:18:10,632 --> 00:18:12,632
I'm going alone.

462
00:18:12,632 --> 00:18:14,632
I like to go alone.

463
00:18:14,632 --> 00:18:16,632
You don't look like you do.

464
00:18:16,632 --> 00:18:18,632
I see.

465
00:18:18,632 --> 00:18:20,632
I've never been on a trip or anything.

466
00:18:20,632 --> 00:18:22,632
This is my first time.

467
00:18:22,632 --> 00:18:24,632
Then this is where you stayed.

468
00:18:24,632 --> 00:18:26,632
Under 18.

469
00:18:26,632 --> 00:18:28,632
They need a parent.

470
00:18:28,632 --> 00:18:30,632
It's just May.

471
00:18:30,632 --> 00:18:32,632
No.

472
00:18:32,632 --> 00:18:34,632
What are we gonna do?

473
00:18:34,632 --> 00:18:36,632
Eat sashimi.

474
00:18:36,632 --> 00:18:38,632
Shibu.

475
00:18:38,632 --> 00:18:40,632
Shibu

476
00:18:40,632 --> 00:18:42,632
Go to a restaurant with a long line.

477
00:18:42,632 --> 00:18:44,632
Eat wet rice crackers in the shopping street

478
00:18:44,632 --> 00:18:46,632
Saw the ocean and came home.

479
00:18:46,632 --> 00:18:48,632
That's a little bitter.

480
00:18:48,632 --> 00:18:50,632
If I could drink alcohol...

481
00:18:50,632 --> 00:18:52,632
I'd like to drink some of the best sake in the country.

482
00:18:52,632 --> 00:18:54,632
I want to go there.

483
00:18:54,632 --> 00:18:56,632
More in the future.

484
00:18:56,632 --> 00:18:58,632
Would you like to go abroad by yourself?

485
00:18:58,632 --> 00:19:00,632
I'd like to.

486
00:19:00,632 --> 00:19:02,632
That's amazing.

487
00:19:02,632 --> 00:19:04,632
You don't think of it as something where you're not alone.

488
00:19:04,632 --> 00:19:06,632
Not at all.

489
00:19:06,632 --> 00:19:08,632
I've done karaoke by myself.

490
00:19:08,632 --> 00:19:10,632
I often do.

491
00:19:10,632 --> 00:19:12,632
The B-grade news brings up some unexpected places.

492
00:19:12,632 --> 00:19:17,264
The most unexpected is the Black Sea.

493
00:19:17,264 --> 00:19:22,584
Now, on to the next one... I'm afraid of this one.

494
00:19:22,584 --> 00:19:29,984
I'm going to tell you something... during the online storytelling session, during the break, Kaede came to my room with a small piece of cake.
なのを頂いたんですよ

495
00:19:29,984 --> 00:19:36,064
Kaede came to my room to eat it and said she forgot to bring a fork.

496
00:19:36,064 --> 00:19:42,704
I forgot to bring a fork and it was right there, but I didn't want to go get it, so I put a long piece of cake all over the room.
ものを探し始めた

497
00:19:42,704 --> 00:19:45,704
I don't know what I'm going to do.

498
00:19:45,704 --> 00:19:52,904
There was a straw and he said he'd eat it by himself and started eating it.

499
00:19:52,904 --> 00:19:57,064
He's a little crass or rough around the edges.

500
00:19:57,064 --> 00:19:59,264
That's why he spills things.

501
00:19:59,264 --> 00:20:01,464
He drinks miso soup with a straw.

502
00:20:01,464 --> 00:20:03,064
I saw that picture before, didn't I?

503
00:20:03,064 --> 00:20:05,064
That's right.

504
00:20:05,064 --> 00:20:07,064
What do you think you can drink anything with a straw?

505
00:20:07,064 --> 00:20:11,624
I always have a straw by my side.

506
00:20:11,624 --> 00:20:13,624
Nobody does that!

507
00:20:13,624 --> 00:20:15,624
Then keep the self-straw with you!

508
00:20:15,624 --> 00:20:18,624
He seems to break things he buys rather easily.

509
00:20:18,624 --> 00:20:25,624
I went to a Harry Potter store in Akasaka with Mukai once and bought a glass jar.

510
00:20:25,624 --> 00:20:28,624
I thought I'd bake cookies and put them in it.

511
00:20:28,624 --> 00:20:30,624
It's cute and stylish, isn't it?

512
00:20:30,624 --> 00:20:38,624
But when I tried to wash them, I dropped them in the sink, and they turned into a crispy mess that day.

513
00:20:38,624 --> 00:20:43,624
The only thing I dropped was the jar, and the lid was still there.

514
00:20:43,624 --> 00:20:46,624
The lid is still in the house.

515
00:20:46,624 --> 00:20:50,624
I'm amazed you took this picture, there are so many great pictures this time.

516
00:20:50,624 --> 00:20:53,624
I don't know how you take a picture after dropping it.

517
00:20:53,624 --> 00:20:55,624
It's probably loose inside.

518
00:20:55,624 --> 00:21:00,624
When I spilled the caterer's food, I brought it in without cleaning the table.

519
00:21:00,624 --> 00:21:01,624
That's right.

520
00:21:01,624 --> 00:21:02,624
You know what?

521
00:21:02,624 --> 00:21:03,624
Desperation.

522
00:21:03,624 --> 00:21:06,624
It's a good picture.

523
00:21:06,624 --> 00:21:08,624
It's good to see her in such good spirits.

524
00:21:08,624 --> 00:21:09,624
It's normal.

525
00:21:09,624 --> 00:21:14,624
People like this definitely make mistakes in their previous actions.

526
00:21:14,624 --> 00:21:17,624
For example, if someone drops this, a normal person would put it here.

527
00:21:17,624 --> 00:21:19,624
But this person puts it here.

528
00:21:19,624 --> 00:21:24,624
And then the person who doesn't look at this properly and doesn't take it, and takes his eyes off here...

529
00:21:24,624 --> 00:21:26,624
They're doing something.

530
00:21:26,624 --> 00:21:27,624
Oh, pick it up.

531
00:21:27,624 --> 00:21:28,624
And...

532
00:21:28,624 --> 00:21:30,624
No, that's crazy.

533
00:21:30,624 --> 00:21:32,624
What kind of relationship is this?

534
00:21:32,624 --> 00:21:34,624
Oh, I'm gonna drop it before you say it.

535
00:21:34,624 --> 00:21:37,624
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

536
00:21:37,624 --> 00:21:39,624
I'll be careful.

537
00:21:39,624 --> 00:21:40,624
I'll be careful.

538
00:21:40,624 --> 00:21:41,624
Next...

539
00:21:41,624 --> 00:21:44,624
What's this?

540
00:21:44,624 --> 00:21:48,624
Yuna and I spend a lot of time together.

541
00:21:48,624 --> 00:21:51,624
When we're together, she talks about her family.

542
00:21:51,624 --> 00:21:55,624
Asuka-chan said she loves talking about her family, too.

543
00:21:55,624 --> 00:21:58,624
I have no one to talk to but my family.

544
00:21:58,624 --> 00:22:00,624
That makes me sad.

545
00:22:00,624 --> 00:22:03,624
I'm in touch with my family a lot.

546
00:22:03,624 --> 00:22:04,624
I'm in touch with them.

547
00:22:04,624 --> 00:22:08,624
I've always thought they're a very kind family.

548
00:22:08,624 --> 00:22:10,624
I just wanted to go see them.

549
00:22:10,624 --> 00:22:14,624
I said I'd go over to their house after work.

550
00:22:14,624 --> 00:22:17,624
I didn't tell them at all, but they said it was okay.

551
00:22:17,624 --> 00:22:20,624
They made me feel so welcome.

552
00:22:20,624 --> 00:22:23,624
I told them I'd have dinner with them at night, and they served me dinner.

553
00:22:23,624 --> 00:22:26,624
I didn't cook for them, but they served me dinner.

554
00:22:26,624 --> 00:22:30,624
Yuna-chan called her mother and told her I was there.

555
00:22:30,624 --> 00:22:36,624
Even though it was nighttime, my mom, brother and sister came to see me after taking a bath.

556
00:22:36,624 --> 00:22:39,624
What a nice family!

557
00:22:39,624 --> 00:22:41,624
I'm going to make a reservation for the next time.

558
00:22:41,624 --> 00:22:42,624
Make a reservation.

559
00:22:42,624 --> 00:22:44,624
And bring souvenirs.

560
00:22:44,624 --> 00:22:46,624
Yeah, I really didn't bring anything.

561
00:22:46,624 --> 00:22:47,624
That sucks.

562
00:22:47,624 --> 00:22:48,624
That sucks.

563
00:22:48,624 --> 00:22:49,624
As an inconvenience.

564
00:22:49,624 --> 00:22:51,624
I just got it and came back.

565
00:22:51,624 --> 00:22:52,624
Yes, it was.

566
00:22:52,624 --> 00:22:53,624
It was raining pretty hard.

567
00:22:53,624 --> 00:22:57,392
Next time it rains, it'll be like a drama-filled morning at the creek.

568
00:22:57,392 --> 00:23:02,152
What does it say?

569
00:23:02,152 --> 00:23:08,952
It was raining on the way to school, but I forgot my umbrella.

570
00:23:08,952 --> 00:23:14,792
I forgot my umbrella... and as I was walking, I fell down like a picture.

571
00:23:14,792 --> 00:23:25,072
I was walking in the rain, and a nice lady put her umbrella in my hand and said, "I'm okay, too.

572
00:23:25,072 --> 00:23:31,072
I told her I was okay too, but she handed it to me and said, "Don't worry about it.
すよ

573
00:23:31,072 --> 00:23:34,592
That's your black body?

574
00:23:34,592 --> 00:23:36,472
I didn't say that.

575
00:23:36,472 --> 00:23:39,472
What kind of world are you talking about?

576
00:23:39,472 --> 00:23:43,472
And it's a kamakin.

577
00:23:43,472 --> 00:23:45,672
What kind of drama is that?

578
00:23:45,672 --> 00:23:48,472
I tried to track him down, but he was gone.

579
00:23:48,472 --> 00:23:50,472
I don't even have his contact info.

580
00:23:50,472 --> 00:23:52,472
That's right.

581
00:23:52,472 --> 00:23:57,472
I carried an umbrella to school for a week after that.

582
00:23:57,472 --> 00:23:59,472
It's okay if I see him anytime.

583
00:23:59,472 --> 00:24:01,472
I thought I could see him, but I couldn't.

584
00:24:01,472 --> 00:24:05,472
So I thought if I could find her, I'd lend her my umbrella and thank her for her kindness.

585
00:24:05,472 --> 00:24:06,472
That's a good story.

586
00:24:06,472 --> 00:24:07,472
Really?

587
00:24:07,472 --> 00:24:08,472
That's the umbrella you lent me.

588
00:24:08,472 --> 00:24:10,472
That's a real umbrella!

589
00:24:10,472 --> 00:24:11,472
That's right.

590
00:24:11,472 --> 00:24:13,472
He gave you that umbrella?

591
00:24:13,472 --> 00:24:17,472
He said he'd buy one.

592
00:24:17,472 --> 00:24:19,472
That's very kind of him.

593
00:24:19,472 --> 00:24:22,472
I'm sad to say, I was a little lost.

594
00:24:22,472 --> 00:24:23,472
Why?

595
00:24:23,472 --> 00:24:27,472
As a member of Nogizaka, I'm supposed to behave properly.

596
00:24:27,472 --> 00:24:31,472
I made the terrible mistake of forgetting my umbrella.

597
00:24:31,472 --> 00:24:33,472
I want to make more mistakes.

598
00:24:33,472 --> 00:24:37,472
It's okay if you didn't bring an umbrella on a rainy day.

599
00:24:37,472 --> 00:24:39,472
If you saw this...

600
00:24:39,472 --> 00:24:41,472
I'd like to ask you to take this.

601
00:24:41,472 --> 00:24:43,472
I'll take this and we'll get started.

602
00:24:43,472 --> 00:24:45,472
Wow, that's a lot of drama.

603
00:24:45,472 --> 00:24:46,472
There's a wonderful woman here.

604
00:24:46,472 --> 00:24:48,472
I've never gotten an umbrella in the rain.

605
00:24:48,472 --> 00:24:49,472
That's a good story.

606
00:24:49,472 --> 00:25:03,994
I think I'm going to get a permanent spot.

607
00:25:03,994 --> 00:25:07,994

608
00:25:07,994 --> 00:25:11,994
