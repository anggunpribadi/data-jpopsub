We are the morning chimes, Shiru TV junior high school.

Oh, sorry. Everyone is in a team.

00:02:05,560 --> 00:02:08,360

Emma-chan might be the MC for today.

00:02:14,984 --> 00:02:16,984
She's been a MC for 3 months.

00:02:17,984 --> 00:02:19,984
She might be the MC for today.

19
00:02:19,984 --> 00:02:21,984
What do you think?

20
00:02:22,984 --> 00:02:24,984
Everyone's got a big tail.

21
00:02:24,984 --> 00:02:26,984
Ema-chan's got a big tail.

22
00:02:26,984 --> 00:02:27,984
Wow!

23
00:02:27,984 --> 00:02:28,984
It's like this.

24
00:02:28,984 --> 00:02:30,984
Yuno chose it.

25
00:02:30,984 --> 00:02:32,984
Yuno chose it?

26
00:02:32,984 --> 00:02:33,984
Yes, Yuno said,

27
00:02:33,984 --> 00:02:34,984
Ema-chan, this is it.

28
00:02:34,984 --> 00:02:36,984
It's cute.

29
00:02:36,984 --> 00:02:42,984
5, 4, 3, 2, 1

30
00:02:43,552 --> 00:02:45,088
Hi

31
00:02:45,088 --> 00:02:47,088

32
00:02:47,088 --> 00:02:49,088

00:02:49,088 --> 00:02:51,088

00:02:53,088 --> 00:02:55,088
Ready, go

43
00:03:09,088 --> 00:03:11,088
I didn't see it

44
00:03:11,088 --> 00:03:13,088

45
00:03:13,088 --> 00:03:15,088

00:03:33,088 --> 00:03:37,088

Let's move on to the next topic.

82
00:05:41,178 --> 00:05:43,178
Yes.

83
00:05:43,178 --> 00:05:45,178
The topic is

84
00:05:45,178 --> 00:05:48,178
fun and funny questionnaire talk.

85
00:05:51,178 --> 00:05:53,178
Before the talk, we will take a questionnaire

86
00:05:53,178 --> 00:05:55,178
and decide what to talk about.

87
00:05:55,178 --> 00:05:57,178
That's what questionnaire talk is.

88
00:05:57,178 --> 00:05:59,178
Yes.

89
00:05:59,178 --> 00:06:01,178
I will announce the topic.

90
00:06:01,178 --> 00:06:03,178
Ta-da.

91
00:06:03,178 --> 00:06:05,178
Ta-da.

92
00:06:05,178 --> 00:06:07,178
There are many.

93
00:06:07,178 --> 00:06:09,178
There are 7.

94
00:06:09,178 --> 00:06:13,178
I will choose from the comments.

95
00:06:13,178 --> 00:06:15,178
I wrote all the letters,

96
00:06:15,178 --> 00:06:17,178
so I don't know who it is.

97
00:06:17,178 --> 00:06:19,178
I don't know who it is.

98
00:06:19,178 --> 00:06:21,178
Please leave a comment

99
00:06:21,178 --> 00:06:23,178

100
00:06:23,178 --> 00:06:25,178
Please vote.

101
00:06:25,178 --> 00:06:27,178
Please vote.

102
00:06:27,178 --> 00:06:29,178
I will start voting.

103
00:06:31,178 --> 00:06:33,178
I wrote all the letters

104
00:06:33,178 --> 00:06:35,178
so that I couldn't judge.

105
00:06:35,178 --> 00:06:37,178
I don't know who it is.

106
00:06:39,178 --> 00:06:41,178
What do you think?

107
00:06:41,178 --> 00:06:43,178
But there are only food.

108
00:06:43,178 --> 00:06:45,178
That's right.

109
00:06:45,178 --> 00:06:47,178
All of them are food.

110
00:06:47,178 --> 00:06:49,178
All of them are food.

111
00:06:49,178 --> 00:06:51,178
What do you think?

112
00:06:51,178 --> 00:06:55,178
What do you think?

113
00:06:55,450 --> 00:06:57,450
First, number 2.

114
00:06:57,450 --> 00:07:02,450
5, 4, 3, 2, 1.

115
00:07:02,450 --> 00:07:03,450
Time's up!

116
00:07:03,450 --> 00:07:06,450
What's the first theme?

117
00:07:06,450 --> 00:07:08,450
Number 2!

118
00:07:08,450 --> 00:07:10,450
Number 2 is 34%.

119
00:07:10,450 --> 00:07:12,450
The second theme is...

120
00:07:12,450 --> 00:07:17,450
Hina Kashiwagi's graduation ceremony and university reunion.

121
00:07:17,450 --> 00:07:23,450
Yay!

122
00:07:23,450 --> 00:07:26,450
Let's start with Hina's graduation ceremony.

123
00:07:26,450 --> 00:07:30,450
It was held at the Makuhari Messe event hall on the 16th.

124
00:07:30,450 --> 00:07:34,450
It was a graduation ceremony for Hina called Smile4U.

125
00:07:34,450 --> 00:07:41,450
The first day was a live performance with a lot of Hina's favorite songs.

126
00:07:41,450 --> 00:07:53,450
There were four people in each unit corner, and Hina sat on a very flashy and
cool chair as the boss.

127
00:07:53,450 --> 00:07:56,450
She was wearing a black mask.

128
00:07:56,450 --> 00:07:59,450
There was no chair at first, but suddenly a chair came out.

129
00:07:59,450 --> 00:08:02,450
Hina is wearing a black mask.

130
00:08:02,450 --> 00:08:14,450
The costume was a black mask with a boss's set-up.

131
00:08:14,450 --> 00:08:19,450
I sang a high-pitched song called YUNOMA HAITO TEKI.

132
00:08:19,450 --> 00:08:28,450
I've been watching you since before.

133
00:08:28,450 --> 00:08:32,450
You must be more nervous than your family watching.

134
00:08:32,450 --> 00:08:42,450
I was really nervous because I felt like I was watching you.

135
00:08:42,450 --> 00:08:49,450
I was surprised to hear that you weren't there when I sang Nagareboshi.

136
00:08:49,450 --> 00:08:57,450
I'm glad I sang with all my heart.

137
00:08:57,450 --> 00:09:06,450
I remember you shooting a gun at the school's tobacco roll.

138
00:09:06,450 --> 00:09:14,450
I shot a gun at the school's tobacco roll.

139
00:09:14,450 --> 00:09:19,450
I remember you shooting a gun at the school's tobacco roll.

140
00:09:19,450 --> 00:09:28,450
It's very light, but it contains dry ice.

141
00:09:28,450 --> 00:09:37,450
I was able to shoot a gun at the school's tobacco roll.

142
00:09:37,450 --> 00:09:39,450
I was watching you at the scene.

143
00:09:39,450 --> 00:09:46,450
I was surprised to see your shout.

144
00:09:46,450 --> 00:09:49,450
YUNO and I did it.

145
00:09:49,450 --> 00:09:56,450
We were both very excited.

146
00:09:56,450 --> 00:10:00,450
I'm glad I did it.

147
00:10:00,450 --> 00:10:04,450
YUNO, please shoot a gun at the school's tobacco roll.

148
00:10:04,450 --> 00:10:06,450
I'll shoot a gun at the school's tobacco roll.

149
00:10:06,450 --> 00:10:10,450
I'll leave it to YUNO from now on.

150
00:10:10,450 --> 00:10:15,450
I'll shoot a gun at the school's tobacco roll on the 17th.

151
00:10:15,450 --> 00:10:20,450
Did you have a song you wanted to do on the 16th?

152
00:10:20,450 --> 00:10:24,450
I wanted to do the school's tobacco roll after school.

153
00:10:24,450 --> 00:10:28,450
I liked YUNO's part.

154
00:10:28,450 --> 00:10:34,450
I like the part after school.

155
00:10:34,450 --> 00:10:40,450
YUNO doesn't usually say that, so I liked it.

156
00:10:40,450 --> 00:10:43,450
YUNO said the same thing.

157
00:10:43,450 --> 00:10:46,450
YUNO said she wanted to do the school's tobacco roll.

158
00:10:46,450 --> 00:10:50,450
It's fun to dance.

159
00:10:50,450 --> 00:10:55,450
I was watching the archive.

160
00:10:55,450 --> 00:11:00,450
The pen lights were all on the X part of the school's tobacco roll.

161
00:11:00,450 --> 00:11:03,450
It was very beautiful and interesting.

162
00:11:03,450 --> 00:11:05,450
That's great.

163
00:11:05,450 --> 00:11:10,450
How was the 16th?

164
00:11:10,450 --> 00:11:13,450
It was a lot of fun.

165
00:11:13,450 --> 00:11:19,450
It was a lot of fun.

166
00:11:19,450 --> 00:11:24,450
The strings sound was amazing.

167
00:11:24,450 --> 00:11:31,450
There were a lot of people coming to see the 4 songs.

168
00:11:31,450 --> 00:11:33,450
It was very beautiful.

169
00:11:33,450 --> 00:11:39,450
I've done it in a band before, but it was different with strings.

170
00:11:39,450 --> 00:11:41,450
It was the best.

171
00:11:41,450 --> 00:11:43,450
I'm glad.

172
00:11:43,450 --> 00:11:45,450
I was moved by the last hug.

173
00:11:45,450 --> 00:11:49,450
It was so cool.

174
00:11:49,450 --> 00:11:52,450
I don't know what they said.

175
00:11:52,450 --> 00:11:53,450
I don't know.

176
00:11:53,450 --> 00:11:57,450
I won't tell you.

177
00:11:57,450 --> 00:12:00,450
The heat of the hot amp was amazing.

178
00:12:00,450 --> 00:12:03,450
The 17th was the same.

179
00:12:03,450 --> 00:12:06,450
The fire was burning.

180
00:12:06,450 --> 00:12:09,450
It was very hot.

181
00:12:09,450 --> 00:12:10,450
It was hot.

182
00:12:10,450 --> 00:12:15,450
It was not so hot in the last university concert.

183
00:12:15,450 --> 00:12:19,450
It was between the front and the back.

184
00:12:19,450 --> 00:12:24,450
The last part was very hot.

185
00:12:24,450 --> 00:12:26,450
It was very hot.

186
00:12:26,450 --> 00:12:27,450
Was the fire hot?

187
00:12:27,450 --> 00:12:29,450
The audience was hot, too.

188
00:12:29,450 --> 00:12:33,450
The family was hot, too.

189
00:12:33,450 --> 00:12:36,450
I was happy that the truck came to the side.

190
00:12:36,450 --> 00:12:39,450
It was the first time for us to ride a truck.

191
00:12:39,450 --> 00:12:43,450
It was the first time for me to ride a truck.

192
00:12:43,450 --> 00:12:48,450
It's getting more and more.

193
00:12:48,450 --> 00:12:52,450
I'm glad that the background was the same as the background.

194
00:12:52,450 --> 00:12:55,450
Hello! was a camp.

195
00:12:55,450 --> 00:12:58,450
It was a theme called a journey of a girl.

196
00:12:58,450 --> 00:12:59,450
It was a school trip.

197
00:12:59,450 --> 00:13:04,450
The costume was casual school trip.

198
00:13:04,450 --> 00:13:06,450
We talked while we were camping.

199
00:13:06,450 --> 00:13:07,450
It was morning.

200
00:13:07,450 --> 00:13:11,450
We woke up when we rehearsed.

201
00:13:11,450 --> 00:13:14,450
We baked marshmallows.

202
00:13:14,450 --> 00:13:17,450
It was fun.

203
00:13:17,450 --> 00:13:20,450
The background was beautiful.

204
00:13:20,450 --> 00:13:22,450
The heat was transmitted three times.

205
00:13:22,450 --> 00:13:26,450
Did you feel the heat?

206
00:13:26,450 --> 00:13:29,450
I didn't feel the heat.

207
00:13:29,450 --> 00:13:35,450
It's hot when you're close to people.

208
00:13:35,450 --> 00:13:38,450
Let's talk about the 17th.

209
00:13:38,450 --> 00:13:41,450
Let's talk about the 17th.

210
00:13:41,450 --> 00:13:47,450
It was the first time for Mayana to perform on the 17th.

211
00:13:47,450 --> 00:13:50,450
How was it?

212
00:13:50,450 --> 00:13:56,450
The scenery was beautiful.

213
00:13:56,450 --> 00:14:03,450
I was impressed by the penlight.

214
00:14:03,450 --> 00:14:07,450
It was the first time for us to perform on such a large stage.

215
00:14:07,450 --> 00:14:14,450
There were many people on the stage.

216
00:14:14,450 --> 00:14:17,450
I was happy.

217
00:14:17,450 --> 00:14:20,450
What do you remember most?

218
00:14:20,450 --> 00:14:23,450
The song?

219
00:14:23,450 --> 00:14:27,450
I think it's the Superhero.

220
00:14:27,450 --> 00:14:31,450
I sang the first song in a circle.

221
00:14:31,450 --> 00:14:34,450
Then I joined the chorus.

222
00:14:34,450 --> 00:14:39,450
YUNA IMAI, KOKOENO NO KA, KAHORI, JUNEN.

223
00:14:39,450 --> 00:14:45,450
The chorus of Superhero is quite high.

224
00:14:45,450 --> 00:14:49,450
I was impressed by YUNA IMAI's performance.

225
00:14:49,450 --> 00:14:54,450
We were surprised.

226
00:14:54,450 --> 00:15:01,450
I don't know if I can say this.

227
00:15:01,450 --> 00:15:11,450
The director asked us to sing together.

228
00:15:11,450 --> 00:15:17,450
We said we would do our best.

229
00:15:17,450 --> 00:15:27,450
We were singing together before we came out.

230
00:15:27,450 --> 00:15:33,450
Mayana's power was overwhelming.

231
00:15:33,450 --> 00:15:37,450
We did our best.

232
00:15:37,450 --> 00:15:44,450
On the 16th, we performed as a band.

233
00:15:44,450 --> 00:15:48,450
But on the 17th, we performed as a group.

234
00:15:48,450 --> 00:15:55,450
We performed as a group.

235
00:15:55,450 --> 00:16:00,450
We performed 8 songs in a row.

236
00:16:00,450 --> 00:16:04,450
And we performed the last song.

237
00:16:04,450 --> 00:16:09,450
How was it?

238
00:16:09,450 --> 00:16:14,450
Did you feel like you were not MCs?

239
00:16:14,450 --> 00:16:19,450
We were talking, but we were not MCs.

240
00:16:19,450 --> 00:16:24,450
We were talking, but we were not MCs.

241
00:16:24,450 --> 00:16:26,450
Hot-up is cool.

242
00:16:26,450 --> 00:16:30,450
I liked the dance.

243
00:16:30,450 --> 00:16:36,450
Thank you. I was nervous.

244
00:16:36,450 --> 00:16:40,450
Mayana's power was overwhelming.

245
00:16:40,450 --> 00:16:44,450
I was exhausted.

246
00:16:44,450 --> 00:16:46,450
I was exhausted, too.

247
00:16:46,450 --> 00:16:49,450
YUNA, you did your best.

248
00:16:49,450 --> 00:16:52,450
The fire was amazing.

249
00:16:52,450 --> 00:16:53,450
I was surprised.

250
00:16:53,450 --> 00:16:58,450
I was sweating a lot.

251
00:16:58,450 --> 00:17:02,450
Mayana, please introduce yourself.

252
00:17:02,450 --> 00:17:06,450
It's your first time to be a MC.

253
00:17:06,450 --> 00:17:10,450
There may not be many people who know you.

254
00:17:10,450 --> 00:17:12,450
Let's start.

255
00:17:12,450 --> 00:17:15,744
Please.

256
00:17:15,744 --> 00:17:22,744
When I say, please smile.

257
00:17:22,744 --> 00:17:25,744
1, 2, 3, smile!

258
00:17:25,744 --> 00:17:27,744
Thank you.

259
00:17:27,744 --> 00:17:29,744
I was laughed at.

260
00:17:29,744 --> 00:17:34,744
I'm Sakurai Eva, the 16th member of the group.

261
00:17:36,744 --> 00:17:37,744
That's good.

262
00:17:37,744 --> 00:17:41,744
Kino-san came up with this.

263
00:17:41,744 --> 00:17:43,744
How did you decide?

264
00:17:43,744 --> 00:17:50,744
We started talking about what kind of character we wanted to make.

265
00:17:50,744 --> 00:17:55,744
And many people asked me what kind of character I wanted to sell.

266
00:17:55,744 --> 00:17:57,744
But Fujii-san said,

267
00:17:57,744 --> 00:18:02,744
I think it's a good thing to keep smiling.

268
00:18:02,744 --> 00:18:05,744
So I thought it would be good to make a character like that.

269
00:18:05,744 --> 00:18:08,744
That's how I came up with the idea of smiling.

270
00:18:08,744 --> 00:18:09,744
That's good.

271
00:18:09,744 --> 00:18:14,744
Ema-chan's smile is cute.

272
00:18:14,744 --> 00:18:17,744
Everyone's smile.

273
00:18:17,744 --> 00:18:24,744
Yuna-chan's self-introduction is in Fukuoka dialect.

274
00:18:24,744 --> 00:18:29,744
We're still talking about it.

275
00:18:29,744 --> 00:18:32,744
When we can do it again,

276
00:18:32,744 --> 00:18:35,744
we'll all be smiling.

277
00:18:35,744 --> 00:18:37,744
I'm looking forward to it.

278
00:18:37,744 --> 00:18:39,744
I want to do it.

279
00:18:39,744 --> 00:18:43,744
The song that's playing now is called Voyager.

280
00:18:43,744 --> 00:18:47,744
There were 9 people, but there were 10 people on the 16th.

281
00:18:47,744 --> 00:18:51,744
We did it for two days.

282
00:18:51,744 --> 00:18:57,744
The song changed and the chorus became Ema Yuna-chan.

283
00:18:57,744 --> 00:18:59,744
It was amazing.

284
00:18:59,744 --> 00:19:09,744
There were many songs for the unconfirmed students and the special university
game.

285
00:19:09,744 --> 00:19:14,744
Only the unconfirmed students are on YouTube now.

286
00:19:14,744 --> 00:19:16,744
Please watch the other videos on the stream.

287
00:19:16,744 --> 00:19:18,744
There are still tickets.

288
00:19:18,744 --> 00:19:22,744
There is an archive until the 24th, so please watch it.

289
00:19:22,744 --> 00:19:24,744
Shall we move on to the next topic?

290
00:19:24,744 --> 00:19:28,744
Shall we move on to the next topic?

291
00:19:28,744 --> 00:19:30,744
Please vote.

292
00:19:34,120 --> 00:19:36,120
You're good at selling.

293
00:19:39,120 --> 00:19:41,120
I'll do my best.

294
00:19:42,120 --> 00:19:44,120
Everyone, please watch it.

295
00:19:45,120 --> 00:19:47,120
What do you think?

296
00:19:47,120 --> 00:19:50,120
What will come?

297
00:19:52,360 --> 00:19:53,360
How will it be?

298
00:19:54,360 --> 00:20:00,360
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10

299
00:20:01,360 --> 00:20:02,360
Time's up!

300
00:20:05,360 --> 00:20:06,360
Which one is it?

301
00:20:06,360 --> 00:20:08,360
Which one?

302
00:20:09,760 --> 00:20:12,760
I'm going to eat curry now, so I want curry.

303
00:20:13,760 --> 00:20:14,760
Number 7!

304
00:20:14,760 --> 00:20:15,760
Number 7!

305
00:20:15,760 --> 00:20:17,760
It's Rika's birthday.

306
00:20:17,760 --> 00:20:18,760
That's right.

307
00:20:18,760 --> 00:20:21,760
Rika's birthday is December 16th.

308
00:20:21,760 --> 00:20:24,592
Happy birthday!

309
00:20:25,592 --> 00:20:29,592
We all gave her a cake on the 15th.

310
00:20:30,592 --> 00:20:33,592
Hinata-chan wrote a cake plate.

311
00:20:33,592 --> 00:20:36,592
She wrote it with a chocolate pen.

312
00:20:36,592 --> 00:20:38,592
She couldn't write it.

313
00:20:38,592 --> 00:20:41,592
She wrote, Maya-chan, happy birthday.

314
00:20:41,592 --> 00:20:43,592
She couldn't write a happy birthday.

315
00:20:43,592 --> 00:20:48,592
But still, happy birthday to you, 26 years old!

316
00:20:48,592 --> 00:20:53,592
I went to Rika-chan's birthday party on the 16th.

317
00:20:53,592 --> 00:20:57,592
I always send her a message on her birthday.

318
00:20:57,592 --> 00:21:00,592
But I thought I didn't send her a message.

319
00:21:00,592 --> 00:21:04,592
I remembered that it was on the 17th.

320
00:21:04,592 --> 00:21:08,592
I was in a hurry, so I sent her a message.

321
00:21:08,592 --> 00:21:10,592
Happy birthday!

322
00:21:10,592 --> 00:21:12,592
I met her and went to her birthday party.

323
00:21:12,592 --> 00:21:15,592
I thought I should send her a message.

324
00:21:15,592 --> 00:21:21,592
I drank all the chocolate pen.

325
00:21:21,592 --> 00:21:25,592
I was like, you have some left over.

326
00:21:25,592 --> 00:21:27,592
I was like, is that okay?

327
00:21:27,592 --> 00:21:29,592
I drank all the chocolate pen.

328
00:21:29,592 --> 00:21:31,592
Happy birthday.

329
00:21:31,592 --> 00:21:35,592
26 years old Maya-chan, you are so good.

330
00:21:35,592 --> 00:21:37,592
I'm 26 years old.

331
00:21:37,592 --> 00:21:39,592
Then, 26 years old.

332
00:21:39,592 --> 00:21:41,592
Who is it?

333
00:21:41,592 --> 00:21:42,800
I'm 26 years old.

334
00:21:43,800 --> 00:21:45,800
It's not much.

335
00:21:45,800 --> 00:21:48,800
I can't tell you how much I know.

336
00:21:48,800 --> 00:21:51,800
I'll tell you how much I know.

337
00:21:51,800 --> 00:21:53,800
Let's go in 3 seconds.

338
00:21:55,800 --> 00:21:56,800
I'll go first.

339
00:21:57,800 --> 00:21:58,800
Start!

340
00:21:58,800 --> 00:22:00,800
She teaches me a lot.

341
00:22:00,800 --> 00:22:02,800
She's kind.

342
00:22:03,800 --> 00:22:08,800
She's the same height as me, so she's cute when she stretches her back.

343
00:22:08,800 --> 00:22:10,800
We have a lot in common.

344
00:22:10,800 --> 00:22:15,800
I like her cool low voice.

345
00:22:15,800 --> 00:22:19,800
I respect her jumping ability.

346
00:22:19,800 --> 00:22:24,800
She gives me easy-to-understand advice on LINE.

347
00:22:24,800 --> 00:22:28,800
She's always there when I'm in trouble.

348
00:22:29,800 --> 00:22:32,800
She gave me a birthday cake with chocolate on it.

349
00:22:32,800 --> 00:22:34,800
There was a lot of chocolate on it.

350
00:22:34,800 --> 00:22:37,800
She praised my makeup.

351
00:22:37,800 --> 00:22:39,800
I have 10 of these.

352
00:22:39,800 --> 00:22:43,800
She taught me a lot of things I didn't know in the lesson.

353
00:22:43,800 --> 00:22:47,800
She's kind when she stretches my back.

354
00:22:47,800 --> 00:22:49,800
Am I okay?

355
00:22:53,800 --> 00:22:55,800
Her eyelashes are big.

356
00:22:55,800 --> 00:22:57,800
Her face is small.

357
00:22:57,800 --> 00:22:59,800
She's wearing cute shoes.

358
00:22:59,800 --> 00:23:02,800
She's wearing the shoes Yuno wanted.

359
00:23:02,800 --> 00:23:06,800
I'm not good at soccer, so I think I'm amazing.

360
00:23:06,800 --> 00:23:08,800
How many did you get?

361
00:23:08,800 --> 00:23:10,800
I like her school uniform.

362
00:23:10,800 --> 00:23:14,800
I got a lot of clothes from her.

363
00:23:14,800 --> 00:23:17,800
They're cute, so I wear them at home.

364
00:23:19,800 --> 00:23:22,800
Thank you for talking to me.

365
00:23:25,800 --> 00:23:27,800
How many did you get?

366
00:23:27,800 --> 00:23:28,800
19.

367
00:23:28,800 --> 00:23:30,800
7 more.

368
00:23:32,800 --> 00:23:34,800
Her nails are beautiful.

369
00:23:34,800 --> 00:23:38,800
She always praises me when I change my nails.

370
00:23:39,800 --> 00:23:42,800
You're talking about Emma.

371
00:23:42,800 --> 00:23:45,800
I just thought of it.

372
00:23:45,800 --> 00:23:46,800
Really?

373
00:23:46,800 --> 00:23:48,800
She always praises my nails.

374
00:23:48,800 --> 00:23:52,800
She said my thumb is cute.

375
00:23:53,800 --> 00:23:56,800
She also praised my pinky.

376
00:24:00,800 --> 00:24:02,800
She praised my nails.

377
00:24:02,800 --> 00:24:04,800
I can't do it.

378
00:24:05,800 --> 00:24:07,800
What else?

379
00:24:07,800 --> 00:24:15,800
She taught me a lot of things when I was training.

380
00:24:15,800 --> 00:24:19,456
She's good at cooking.

381
00:24:19,456 --> 00:24:21,456
I'm thin.

382
00:24:21,456 --> 00:24:23,456
Last one.

383
00:24:23,456 --> 00:24:25,456
What's the best thing about me?

384
00:24:30,456 --> 00:24:34,456
I think I look good in everything from pop to mature.

385
00:24:37,456 --> 00:24:42,456
I said 26 years old.

386
00:24:43,456 --> 00:24:45,456
I have more than that.

387
00:24:45,456 --> 00:24:48,456
Congratulations.

388
00:24:48,456 --> 00:24:51,456
I hope you have a wonderful 26 years old.

389
00:24:51,456 --> 00:24:53,456
Please do.

390
00:24:55,456 --> 00:24:57,456
Let's move on to the next topic.

391
00:24:59,456 --> 00:25:01,456
Please vote.

392
00:25:03,456 --> 00:25:05,456
Left all the time?

393
00:25:05,456 --> 00:25:07,456
The horns are on the right.

394
00:25:08,456 --> 00:25:10,456
Heavy.

395
00:25:10,456 --> 00:25:12,456
I'm moving when I nod.

396
00:25:12,456 --> 00:25:14,456
I was surprised.

397
00:25:14,456 --> 00:25:16,456
Emma was like this.

398
00:25:16,456 --> 00:25:18,456
It was cute.

399
00:25:19,456 --> 00:25:21,456
It was bigger than I thought.

400
00:25:21,456 --> 00:25:23,456
It was funny.

401
00:25:23,456 --> 00:25:25,456
How about this?

402
00:25:25,456 --> 00:25:27,456
Are you ready?

403
00:25:27,456 --> 00:25:34,456
5,4,3,2,1, start!

404
00:25:34,560 --> 00:25:36,560
What is it?

405
00:25:39,648 --> 00:25:40,648
5.

406
00:25:40,648 --> 00:25:42,648
Curry and curry.

407
00:25:42,648 --> 00:25:44,648
Who is this?

408
00:25:44,648 --> 00:25:46,648
This is me.

409
00:25:46,648 --> 00:25:49,648
I have something to say.

410
00:25:49,648 --> 00:25:53,648
I'm doing a little bit of a forced interview right now.

411
00:25:53,648 --> 00:25:55,648
I can do it.

412
00:25:55,648 --> 00:26:04,648
When it's over, I want to go to a curry shop.

413
00:26:04,648 --> 00:26:07,648
Cheese naan looks really good.

414
00:26:07,648 --> 00:26:18,648
I want to eat a lot of curry toppings.

415
00:26:18,648 --> 00:26:21,648
I remembered curry.

416
00:26:21,648 --> 00:26:24,648
Did you eat spicy curry?

417
00:26:24,648 --> 00:26:26,648
It's strange.

418
00:26:26,648 --> 00:26:29,648
I didn't eat it at all.

419
00:26:29,648 --> 00:26:32,648
I ate it while saying it was a little spicy.

420
00:26:32,648 --> 00:26:37,648
I was surprised when I ate it with everyone.

421
00:26:37,648 --> 00:26:40,648
I'm not good at spicy food.

422
00:26:40,648 --> 00:26:47,648
I want you to tell me the recommended toppings.

423
00:26:47,648 --> 00:26:50,648
I'm really looking forward to it.

424
00:26:50,648 --> 00:26:55,648
Do you eat curry at the store?

425
00:26:55,648 --> 00:26:58,648
I think there are more take-out shops.

426
00:26:58,648 --> 00:27:02,648
I have a lot of curry at home.

427
00:27:02,648 --> 00:27:10,648
I'm at a curry shop near my house.

428
00:27:10,648 --> 00:27:15,648
The cheese and shrimp in the curry shop are delicious.

429
00:27:15,648 --> 00:27:21,648
The shrimp is also big and delicious.

430
00:27:21,648 --> 00:27:24,648
I like to eat it with naan.

431
00:27:24,648 --> 00:27:28,648
I like to eat it with naan.

432
00:27:28,648 --> 00:27:34,648
I like the potato in the Obelgine curry.

433
00:27:34,648 --> 00:27:36,648
I understand.

434
00:27:36,648 --> 00:27:39,648
The butter is delicious.

435
00:27:39,648 --> 00:27:42,648
There are a lot of toppings.

436
00:27:42,648 --> 00:27:48,648
I think there are a lot of variations of toppings.

437
00:27:48,648 --> 00:27:50,648
How many are there?

438
00:27:50,648 --> 00:27:54,648
I want to eat natto.

439
00:27:54,648 --> 00:27:56,648
What about you?

440
00:27:56,648 --> 00:27:59,648
What do you like?

441
00:27:59,648 --> 00:28:02,648
I like natto.

442
00:28:02,648 --> 00:28:08,648
I like curry with a lot of toppings.

443
00:28:08,648 --> 00:28:11,648
I like simple things.

444
00:28:11,648 --> 00:28:14,648
I've never eaten curry with naan.

445
00:28:14,648 --> 00:28:17,648
I also like eggplant.

446
00:28:17,648 --> 00:28:20,648
It looks delicious.

447
00:28:21,824 --> 00:28:23,824
There are so many.

448
00:28:23,824 --> 00:28:24,824
Really?

449
00:28:24,824 --> 00:28:25,824
Where is it?

450
00:28:25,824 --> 00:28:26,824
Oh, it's true!

451
00:28:26,824 --> 00:28:27,824
Wow!

452
00:28:27,824 --> 00:28:32,824
Last time, when we went to Osaka for the 2man zip tour,

453
00:28:32,824 --> 00:28:35,824
we went to a curry shop with Hinata, Ucchi and I.

454
00:28:35,824 --> 00:28:37,824
The curry there was really delicious.

455
00:28:37,824 --> 00:28:42,824
I forgot the name, but it was spicy soup curry, but it was delicious.

456
00:28:42,824 --> 00:28:45,824
Soup curry is also delicious.

457
00:28:45,824 --> 00:28:47,824
What was the name of the curry shop?

458
00:28:47,824 --> 00:28:49,824
There are so many.

459
00:28:49,824 --> 00:28:52,824
I want to know because Hinata tweeted.

460
00:28:52,824 --> 00:28:56,824
I want to add cheese, but I want to add cheese and natto.

461
00:28:56,824 --> 00:29:01,824
I'm thinking of adding cheese and natto at first.

462
00:29:01,824 --> 00:29:03,824
I think so.

463
00:29:03,824 --> 00:29:04,824
I think so.

464
00:29:04,824 --> 00:29:05,824
Thank you.

465
00:29:05,824 --> 00:29:06,824
That's all.

466
00:29:06,824 --> 00:29:08,824
What I want to talk about is...

467
00:29:08,824 --> 00:29:10,824
I remembered! It's Watanabe curry!

468
00:29:10,824 --> 00:29:12,824
I went to Watanabe curry and it was delicious.

469
00:29:12,824 --> 00:29:13,824
Osaka?

470
00:29:13,824 --> 00:29:14,824
Yes, Osaka.

471
00:29:14,824 --> 00:29:17,824
I want to eat it when I go there.

472
00:29:17,824 --> 00:29:19,824
What should we do next?

473
00:29:19,824 --> 00:29:21,824
Shall we go to the next place?

474
00:29:21,824 --> 00:29:22,824
Let's go to the next place.

475
00:29:22,824 --> 00:29:26,304
I will go to the next place.

476
00:29:27,304 --> 00:29:30,304
You can choose the same one.

477
00:29:30,304 --> 00:29:32,304
Let's talk as many times as you want.

478
00:29:32,304 --> 00:29:35,304
OK. I'm fine with anything.

479
00:29:35,304 --> 00:29:38,304
You can talk about curry as many times as you want.

480
00:29:38,304 --> 00:29:40,304
Please vote.

481
00:29:40,304 --> 00:29:45,504
Please vote.

482
00:29:45,504 --> 00:29:49,004
I'm glad. My ears turn red right away.

483
00:29:49,004 --> 00:29:51,504
It's good to be able to hide.

484
00:29:51,504 --> 00:29:54,504
It's good. This is very warm.

485
00:29:56,504 --> 00:29:59,504
Emma-chan has been fixing her horns.

486
00:29:59,504 --> 00:30:01,504
It's heavy, isn't it?

487
00:30:01,504 --> 00:30:09,504
5, 4, 3, 2, 1

488
00:30:09,504 --> 00:30:15,504
What's the result?

489
00:30:15,866 --> 00:30:17,866
Number 3!

490
00:30:17,866 --> 00:30:19,866
What is it?

491
00:30:19,866 --> 00:30:21,866
Favorite snack!

492
00:30:21,866 --> 00:30:23,866
Who is it?

493
00:30:23,866 --> 00:30:25,866
Emma-chan!

494
00:30:25,866 --> 00:30:27,866
Please go ahead.

495
00:30:27,866 --> 00:30:29,866
My favorite snack is...

496
00:30:29,866 --> 00:30:31,866
I've been into this lately.

497
00:30:31,866 --> 00:30:33,866
Do you like beans?

498
00:30:33,866 --> 00:30:35,866
Beans?

499
00:30:35,866 --> 00:30:37,866
The green beans?

500
00:30:37,866 --> 00:30:39,866
The ones that are a bit dark.

501
00:30:39,866 --> 00:30:41,866
I like that.

502
00:30:41,866 --> 00:30:43,866
I made that into a snack.

503
00:30:43,866 --> 00:30:45,866
Really?

504
00:30:45,866 --> 00:30:47,866
There's a snack called Mino.

505
00:30:47,866 --> 00:30:51,866
I've been into that lately.

506
00:30:51,866 --> 00:30:55,866
I saw it in a commercial.

507
00:30:55,866 --> 00:30:57,866
I thought it looked really good.

508
00:30:57,866 --> 00:31:01,866
But I always forget to buy it when it's on sale.

509
00:31:01,866 --> 00:31:05,866
I don't really recommend it to my friends.

510
00:31:05,866 --> 00:31:09,866
I don't really like beans.

511
00:31:09,866 --> 00:31:11,866
I like beans.

512
00:31:11,866 --> 00:31:13,866
It has a bit of a smell.

513
00:31:13,866 --> 00:31:17,866
I've heard that it goes well with beer.

514
00:31:17,866 --> 00:31:21,866
Everyone says it's a secret.

515
00:31:21,866 --> 00:31:23,866
My grandma likes it.

516
00:31:23,866 --> 00:31:25,866
You're buying it with your grandma?

517
00:31:25,866 --> 00:31:27,866
It looks good.

518
00:31:27,866 --> 00:31:29,866
I want to buy it.

519
00:31:29,866 --> 00:31:33,866
Do you carry it around?

520
00:31:33,866 --> 00:31:37,866
I've been carrying it around a lot lately.

521
00:31:37,866 --> 00:31:39,866
I'll make you eat it.

522
00:31:39,866 --> 00:31:41,866
I'll make you eat it.

523
00:31:41,866 --> 00:31:43,866
I'm looking forward to it.

524
00:31:43,866 --> 00:31:45,866
I'm happy.

525
00:31:45,866 --> 00:31:49,866
Do you like ginnan?

526
00:31:49,866 --> 00:31:51,866
Ginnan?

527
00:31:51,866 --> 00:31:53,866
The yellow potatoes?

528
00:31:53,866 --> 00:31:55,866
Yeah, the beans.

529
00:31:55,866 --> 00:31:59,866
I can't understand you.

530
00:31:59,866 --> 00:32:01,866
I've never eaten ginnan.

531
00:32:01,866 --> 00:32:03,866
I don't like ginnan.

532
00:32:03,866 --> 00:32:07,866
I thought there were more people who could give it to me.

533
00:32:07,866 --> 00:32:09,866
What does it taste like?

534
00:32:09,866 --> 00:32:11,866
It's like a chawanmushi.

535
00:32:11,866 --> 00:32:13,866
It's beans.

536
00:32:13,866 --> 00:32:17,866
It's like yellow potatoes.

537
00:32:17,866 --> 00:32:19,866
It's beans.

538
00:32:19,866 --> 00:32:23,296
It's beans.

539
00:32:23,296 --> 00:32:25,296
Oh, our favorite sweets?

540
00:32:25,296 --> 00:32:28,296
Yuna's basically got a gummy.

541
00:32:28,296 --> 00:32:31,296
Do you have any recommendations?

542
00:32:31,296 --> 00:32:33,296
What's your favorite gummy?

543
00:32:33,296 --> 00:32:35,296
What was it? The cloud gummy?

544
00:32:35,296 --> 00:32:37,296
They sell cherry flavored ones at Family Mart.

545
00:32:37,296 --> 00:32:39,296
That's the best.

546
00:32:39,296 --> 00:32:43,296
Oh, I got that a while ago. It was delicious.

547
00:32:43,296 --> 00:32:49,296
And that's Ruri-chan's favorite gummy.

548
00:32:49,296 --> 00:32:54,296
She said the dark cherry flavor was really good.

549
00:32:54,296 --> 00:32:59,296
I got it, but it was so good that I thought I'd buy it, but I didn't.

550
00:32:59,296 --> 00:33:01,296
It's not sold much.

551
00:33:01,296 --> 00:33:03,296
Oh, it's not sold?

552
00:33:03,296 --> 00:33:06,296
It's not sold much, so I don't know if it's sold out.

553
00:33:06,296 --> 00:33:09,296
But Ruri-chan said she's already buying it.

554
00:33:09,296 --> 00:33:12,296
She said, when you want it, you can go anytime.

555
00:33:12,296 --> 00:33:15,296
I was surprised.

556
00:33:15,296 --> 00:33:20,296
I usually eat chocolate.

557
00:33:20,296 --> 00:33:23,296
I don't know.

558
00:33:23,296 --> 00:33:29,296
It's ice cream, but there's a convenience store called Koeda.

559
00:33:29,296 --> 00:33:32,296
They sell ice cream at Koeda.

560
00:33:32,296 --> 00:33:34,296
It looked really good.

561
00:33:34,296 --> 00:33:39,296
I didn't have the money to eat it right away, so I thought it would melt.

562
00:33:39,296 --> 00:33:42,296
But I couldn't find it.

563
00:33:42,296 --> 00:33:47,296
It looked really good, so if you find it, please let me know.

564
00:33:47,296 --> 00:33:49,296
I really want to eat it.

565
00:33:49,296 --> 00:33:50,296
I like chocolate.

566
00:33:50,296 --> 00:33:54,296
I found a chocolate ball ice cream today.

567
00:33:54,296 --> 00:33:56,296
I've had it before.

568
00:33:56,296 --> 00:33:58,296
It's really good.

569
00:33:58,296 --> 00:34:01,296
Please come and buy it.

570
00:34:01,296 --> 00:34:03,296
What's your favorite snack?

571
00:34:03,296 --> 00:34:09,296
It's not a sweet snack after the live, but it's not a salty snack, but you want
to eat it.

572
00:34:09,296 --> 00:34:12,296
What's your favorite?

573
00:34:12,296 --> 00:34:15,296
There's a Koeda ice cream at Lawson.

574
00:34:15,296 --> 00:34:17,296
I'll go to Lawson.

575
00:34:17,296 --> 00:34:19,296
You're a good girl.

576
00:34:21,296 --> 00:34:23,296
Wasabi beef.

577
00:34:23,296 --> 00:34:25,296
Wasabi beef?

578
00:34:25,296 --> 00:34:29,296
I've seen it, but I've never eaten it.

579
00:34:29,296 --> 00:34:32,296
What kind of spicy?

580
00:34:32,296 --> 00:34:40,296
I'm going to put the crunchy dried plum on it. It's in the manager's bag.

581
00:34:40,296 --> 00:34:42,296
He's preparing it.

582
00:34:42,296 --> 00:34:47,296
I put it in the bag so I can eat it anytime during the lesson.

583
00:34:47,296 --> 00:34:49,296
It's a salt supplement.

584
00:34:49,296 --> 00:35:01,296
I bought a dried plum with no colorant.

585
00:35:01,296 --> 00:35:05,296
It's a natural one.

586
00:35:05,296 --> 00:35:16,296
I ate a lot of dried natto.

587
00:35:16,296 --> 00:35:20,296
It's really good and healthy.

588
00:35:20,296 --> 00:35:25,296
I thought it would be good for when I wanted to eat sweets.

589
00:35:25,296 --> 00:35:27,296
It was natto.

590
00:35:27,296 --> 00:35:29,296
It was natto. It was delicious.

591
00:35:29,296 --> 00:35:31,296
That's all.

592
00:35:31,296 --> 00:35:33,296
There was natto on the 17th catering.

593
00:35:33,296 --> 00:35:35,296
There was.

594
00:35:35,296 --> 00:35:38,464
It was delicious.

595
00:35:39,464 --> 00:35:44,464
So, let's move on to the last topic.

596
00:35:46,464 --> 00:35:47,464
What is it?

597
00:35:48,464 --> 00:35:49,464
Please vote.

598
00:35:49,464 --> 00:35:55,464
Start!

599
00:35:55,488 --> 00:35:58,488
I'm sure you're all aware of this.

600
00:35:58,488 --> 00:36:00,488
Yeah, I am.

601
00:36:00,488 --> 00:36:05,488
She said she ate a few slices of chocolate at night.

602
00:36:05,488 --> 00:36:13,488
I heard a celebrity eat chocolate before going to bed, and she ate two slices of
it.

603
00:36:13,488 --> 00:36:15,488
I told you that's not true!

604
00:36:15,488 --> 00:36:18,488
I'm sure it's not!

605
00:36:18,488 --> 00:36:25,488
I think it's 70% chocolate.

606
00:36:25,488 --> 00:36:27,488
I was surprised.

607
00:36:27,488 --> 00:36:33,488
5, 4, 3, 2, 1, time's up!

608
00:36:33,488 --> 00:36:37,584
What was your last talk?

609
00:36:37,584 --> 00:36:39,584
What was it?

610
00:36:39,584 --> 00:36:41,584
Number 4!

611
00:36:41,584 --> 00:36:43,584
This is Yuno's.

612
00:36:43,584 --> 00:36:45,584
Yes, Yuno's.

613
00:36:45,584 --> 00:36:47,584
I was curious about this one.

614
00:36:47,584 --> 00:36:51,584
I ordered a dashi rolled egg.

615
00:36:51,584 --> 00:36:53,584
It was a take-out.

616
00:36:53,584 --> 00:36:57,584
I ordered it and it was sweet.

617
00:36:57,584 --> 00:37:01,584
The egg rolls in Tokyo are usually sweet.

618
00:37:01,584 --> 00:37:02,584
Like bento.

619
00:37:02,584 --> 00:37:06,584
Aichi's is a soupy one, not sweet at all.

620
00:37:06,584 --> 00:37:10,584
I wanted to know if you like sweet or salty.

621
00:37:10,584 --> 00:37:12,584
I like salty food.

622
00:37:12,584 --> 00:37:14,584
I know, right?

623
00:37:14,584 --> 00:37:16,584
I said it.

624
00:37:16,584 --> 00:37:20,584
I've eaten salty food.

625
00:37:20,584 --> 00:37:22,584
I've only eaten sweet food.

626
00:37:22,584 --> 00:37:28,584
My mom and grandma make sweet food for me.

627
00:37:28,584 --> 00:37:30,584
My mom is a salty food lover.

628
00:37:30,584 --> 00:37:32,584
What do you guys like?

629
00:37:32,584 --> 00:37:38,584
I sometimes want to eat sweet food, but I like salty food.

630
00:37:38,584 --> 00:37:42,584
I think it's better to have a lot of soup.

631
00:37:42,584 --> 00:37:44,584
Let's vote.

632
00:37:44,584 --> 00:37:48,584
Number 1 is sweet, number 2 is salty.

633
00:37:48,584 --> 00:37:50,584
Please vote.

634
00:37:50,584 --> 00:37:52,584
I like the egg roll.

635
00:37:52,584 --> 00:37:54,584
I like the normal egg roll.

636
00:37:54,584 --> 00:37:56,584
I like the soup.

637
00:37:56,584 --> 00:37:58,584
I like both.

638
00:37:58,584 --> 00:38:02,584
I was surprised that it was sweet when I received it.

639
00:38:02,584 --> 00:38:05,584
I wanted to eat this.

640
00:38:05,584 --> 00:38:07,584
Sweet food is good, though.

641
00:38:07,584 --> 00:38:11,584
I don't know how to make eggs sweet.

642
00:38:11,584 --> 00:38:13,584
Some people like it.

643
00:38:13,584 --> 00:38:19,584
I'm disappointed when I eat it in a bento.

644
00:38:19,584 --> 00:38:23,584
Which one is more popular?

645
00:38:23,584 --> 00:38:28,584
The egg roll at a sushi restaurant is sweet.

646
00:38:34,584 --> 00:38:36,584
Time's up.

647
00:38:37,584 --> 00:38:40,584
Kyushu is famous for sweet soy sauce.

648
00:38:40,584 --> 00:38:43,584
I want to eat soy sauce.

649
00:38:43,584 --> 00:38:46,584
I like salty food.

650
00:38:46,584 --> 00:38:48,584
I think it's a big difference.

651
00:38:48,584 --> 00:38:50,584
44% and 55%.

652
00:38:50,584 --> 00:38:55,584
I think it depends on the region.

653
00:38:55,584 --> 00:38:58,584
Is Kanto sweet?

654
00:38:58,584 --> 00:39:02,584
Nagasaki is overwhelmingly sweet.

655
00:39:02,584 --> 00:39:05,584
Kyushu is different.

656
00:39:06,584 --> 00:39:08,584
Which one is Yuna?

657
00:39:08,584 --> 00:39:12,584
I think it's Fukuoka.

658
00:39:12,584 --> 00:39:20,584
I think it depends on the region.

659
00:39:21,624 --> 00:39:23,624
Kansai is salty.

660
00:39:23,624 --> 00:39:28,624
I saw an omelette earlier. Is there a sweet one?

661
00:39:28,624 --> 00:39:32,624
Omelette? I think it's sweet.

662
00:39:33,624 --> 00:39:37,624
Omelette is just an egg and sugar.

663
00:39:37,624 --> 00:39:40,624
It's not tasty without sugar.

664
00:39:41,624 --> 00:39:43,624
Wait, wait, wait.

665
00:39:43,624 --> 00:39:45,624
It's about omelette.

666
00:39:45,624 --> 00:39:47,624
It's about egg.

667
00:39:47,624 --> 00:39:49,624
I see.

668
00:39:49,624 --> 00:39:54,624
But omelette and rice are not salty, right?

669
00:39:54,624 --> 00:39:56,624
Is it sweet?

670
00:39:56,624 --> 00:39:58,624
Wait, isn't it sweet?

671
00:39:58,624 --> 00:40:04,624
I think it's salty because of ketchup.

672
00:40:04,624 --> 00:40:06,624
You don't put ketchup, do you?

673
00:40:06,624 --> 00:40:08,624
Is it salty because I don't put it?

674
00:40:08,624 --> 00:40:12,624
It's not salty.

675
00:40:12,624 --> 00:40:16,624
I don't feel the sweetness.

676
00:40:16,624 --> 00:40:19,624
I think it's important not to put sugar in omelette.

677
00:40:21,624 --> 00:40:23,624
I just remembered.

678
00:40:23,624 --> 00:40:26,624
I heard there are both in Fukuoka.

679
00:40:26,624 --> 00:40:29,624
It says you can put mentaiko in Fukuoka.

680
00:40:30,624 --> 00:40:32,624
Mentaiko looks good.

681
00:40:32,624 --> 00:40:39,392
I like the omelette in the bento.

682
00:40:40,392 --> 00:40:41,392
It looks delicious.

683
00:40:42,392 --> 00:40:43,392
I like the one that you can make at home.

684
00:40:44,392 --> 00:40:48,392
I like the one that you cut the ham into small pieces and put it in the middle
of the omelette.

685
00:40:49,392 --> 00:40:51,392
I like the one with cheese.

686
00:40:54,392 --> 00:40:55,392
I've eaten the omelette.

687
00:40:57,392 --> 00:40:58,392
I wonder what it tastes like.

688
00:40:59,392 --> 00:41:05,392
There are many different kinds of soup stock in each region.

689
00:41:05,392 --> 00:41:08,392
I want to compare the taste of each region.

690
00:41:09,392 --> 00:41:10,392
It looks fun.

691
00:41:11,392 --> 00:41:13,392
Sweet omelette goes well with mentaiko.

692
00:41:14,392 --> 00:41:15,392
I see.

693
00:41:16,392 --> 00:41:17,392
Does it mean sweet and salty?

694
00:41:18,392 --> 00:41:19,392
I don't know what it means.

695
00:41:21,392 --> 00:41:22,392
Time's up.

696
00:41:24,392 --> 00:41:25,392
Thank you very much.

697
00:41:26,392 --> 00:41:27,392
Thank you.

698
00:41:28,392 --> 00:41:30,392
I'm a salty person.

699
00:41:30,392 --> 00:41:34,392
That was a fun and fun questionnaire talk.

700
00:41:39,392 --> 00:41:44,392
This is the end of the 52nd episode of the showroom.

701
00:41:46,392 --> 00:41:47,392
Let's read the questions.

702
00:41:48,392 --> 00:41:49,392
Yuno, please.

703
00:41:50,392 --> 00:41:51,392
Emma, please.

704
00:41:52,392 --> 00:41:54,392
Please read the questions.

705
00:41:54,392 --> 00:41:58,392
Please read the questions.

706
00:42:01,408 --> 00:42:16,408
The F.C. Family Gathering 2023 will be held at Pacifico Yokohama National Hall
on February 12, 2023.

707
00:42:16,408 --> 00:42:21,408
The tickets will be on sale on the 17th.

708
00:42:21,408 --> 00:42:27,408
You can find out a lot of new things about MNL48.

709
00:42:27,408 --> 00:42:31,408
Last year, Yuno and the others wore pajamas.

710
00:42:31,408 --> 00:42:34,408
We were supposed to change into our pajamas and go to work.

711
00:42:34,408 --> 00:42:36,408
What will it be like this year?

712
00:42:36,408 --> 00:42:39,408
Please look forward to what will happen this year.

713
00:42:39,408 --> 00:42:41,408
And there's one more.

714
00:42:41,408 --> 00:42:44,832
Please look forward to it.

715
00:42:44,832 --> 00:42:46,412
Yeah.

716
00:42:46,736 --> 00:42:55,736
Mayamania Level 7, KTZ Yokohama.

717
00:42:55,736 --> 00:43:00,736
Mayamania's birthday solo live.

718
00:43:00,736 --> 00:43:10,736
We just celebrated it, so please come and enjoy it.

719
00:43:10,736 --> 00:43:20,736
There is also a Stapler Festival in January, so please come.

720
00:43:20,736 --> 00:43:28,016
We will now look at the top 5.

721
00:43:29,016 --> 00:43:30,016
What's the ranking?

722
00:43:31,016 --> 00:43:35,016
5th place, Jimmy-san. Thank you.

723
00:43:36,016 --> 00:43:39,016
4th place, Kasabutta-san. Thank you.

724
00:43:40,016 --> 00:43:43,016
3rd place, Kids-san. Thank you.

725
00:43:44,016 --> 00:43:46,016
2nd place, Ryota-san. Thank you.

726
00:43:46,016 --> 00:43:51,136
1st place, Monta-san. Thank you.

727
00:43:52,136 --> 00:43:57,136
So, it seems like this was the last showroom in 2022.

728
00:43:57,136 --> 00:43:59,136
Is that so? I hope it was okay.

729
00:43:59,136 --> 00:44:00,136
It was okay.

730
00:44:00,136 --> 00:44:01,136
Oh, I have a question.

731
00:44:01,136 --> 00:44:04,136
What was the year like for the three of you?

732
00:44:04,136 --> 00:44:05,136
What was the year like?

733
00:44:05,136 --> 00:44:06,136
What should I do?

734
00:44:06,136 --> 00:44:07,136
I'll go first.

735
00:44:07,136 --> 00:44:09,136
You go first, Emma.

736
00:44:09,136 --> 00:44:11,136
Okay, I'll go first.

737
00:44:11,136 --> 00:44:14,136
Well, we had a spring tour and a family tour.

738
00:44:14,136 --> 00:44:17,136
A lot of things we couldn't do last year came back.

739
00:44:17,136 --> 00:44:24,136
We can't say it yet, but we've had more opportunities to meet with our families.

740
00:44:24,136 --> 00:44:30,136
I've been on stage, and I think it's a year of growth.

741
00:44:30,136 --> 00:44:36,136
I think there will be a lot of acting work and live performances next year.

742
00:44:36,136 --> 00:44:38,136
I hope you'll come.

743
00:44:39,136 --> 00:44:40,136
Great.

744
00:44:40,136 --> 00:44:45,136
What was the year like for Yuno?

745
00:44:45,136 --> 00:44:49,136
January was...

746
00:44:49,136 --> 00:44:52,136
What was January like this year?

747
00:44:54,136 --> 00:44:55,136
It's okay.

748
00:44:55,136 --> 00:44:56,136
It's okay.

749
00:44:56,136 --> 00:44:59,136
January was...

750
00:44:59,136 --> 00:45:01,136
January was a lot of things. February was...

751
00:45:01,136 --> 00:45:03,136
There was Fushiibe. March was...

752
00:45:03,136 --> 00:45:05,136
There was a lot of things. April was...

753
00:45:05,136 --> 00:45:06,136
Albums.

754
00:45:06,136 --> 00:45:07,136
We released an album.

755
00:45:07,136 --> 00:45:13,136
We had a spring tour, and then we started releasing 10 contents.

756
00:45:13,136 --> 00:45:15,136
We recorded a lot of songs.

757
00:45:15,136 --> 00:45:18,136
We had a fan meeting, a fan meeting, and a concert.

758
00:45:18,136 --> 00:45:20,136
We also had a Taiwan tour.

759
00:45:20,136 --> 00:45:21,136
We had a Taiwan tour.

760
00:45:21,136 --> 00:45:24,136
There were a lot of live performances this year.

761
00:45:24,136 --> 00:45:25,136
That's right.

762
00:45:25,136 --> 00:45:28,136
There were a lot of things.

763
00:45:28,136 --> 00:45:29,136
Next year...

764
00:45:29,136 --> 00:45:31,136
Oh, I forgot. We had a singing contest last year.

765
00:45:31,136 --> 00:45:33,136
That's right.

766
00:45:33,136 --> 00:45:34,136
There were a lot of live performances.

767
00:45:34,136 --> 00:45:36,136
There were a lot of live performances.

768
00:45:36,136 --> 00:45:41,136
I hope we can do a lot of live performances in 2023.

769
00:45:41,136 --> 00:45:50,136
I hope we can do a lot of live performances in 2023.

770
00:45:50,136 --> 00:45:51,136
That's right.

771
00:45:51,136 --> 00:45:53,136
Thank you.

772
00:45:53,136 --> 00:45:57,136
How about you, Emma?

773
00:45:57,136 --> 00:46:05,136
I'm used to being a new member of Ebichu this year.

774
00:46:05,136 --> 00:46:07,136
It was a big year.

775
00:46:07,136 --> 00:46:12,136
It was a year of great changes.

776
00:46:12,136 --> 00:46:18,136
It was the first live performance at the university concert.

777
00:46:18,136 --> 00:46:20,136
I was very nervous.

778
00:46:20,136 --> 00:46:24,136
I think it was the best memory of this year.

779
00:46:24,136 --> 00:46:25,136
Yes.

780
00:46:25,136 --> 00:46:28,136
It's only been four days since the show.

781
00:46:28,136 --> 00:46:29,136
That's right.

782
00:46:29,136 --> 00:46:30,136
Oh, really?

783
00:46:30,136 --> 00:46:32,136
It's strange.

784
00:46:32,136 --> 00:46:34,136
I feel like it's been a few days.

785
00:46:34,136 --> 00:46:36,136
I feel like it's been a month.

786
00:46:36,136 --> 00:46:40,136
There are a lot of live performances next year, so please come and see us.

787
00:46:40,136 --> 00:46:42,136
Thank you.

788
00:46:42,136 --> 00:46:49,136
That's all for the 52nd episode of the showroom.

789
00:46:49,136 --> 00:46:53,136
We'll tell you the next episode as soon as it's decided.

790
00:46:53,136 --> 00:46:59,136
Please check out the feedback session that will be held after this.

791
00:46:59,136 --> 00:47:05,136
The show will end, but we'll be back soon, so please stay tuned.

792
00:47:05,136 --> 00:47:10,136
If you have any comments you want to tell us, please leave them in the comments.

793
00:47:10,136 --> 00:47:11,136
That's all for today.

794
00:47:11,136 --> 00:47:13,136
We are Shirite Ebichu.

795
00:47:13,136 --> 00:47:16,136
We are Shirite Ebichu.

796
00:47:16,136 --> 00:47:37,136
Bye bye.

797
00:47:37,658 --> 00:47:44,658
My mom made me a dango with the name of the three dango brothers.

798
00:47:44,658 --> 00:47:46,658
I really liked it.

799
00:47:46,658 --> 00:47:47,658
I don't know.

800
00:47:47,658 --> 00:47:51,658
Because I have a speciality of my family.

801
00:47:51,658 --> 00:47:52,658
Do you have any?

802
00:47:52,658 --> 00:47:54,658
What did you like?

803
00:47:54,658 --> 00:47:56,658
Octopus sausage.

804
00:47:56,658 --> 00:47:57,658
Octopus sausage.

805
00:47:57,658 --> 00:47:58,658
I really liked it.

806
00:47:58,658 --> 00:48:01,658
I couldn't make octopus sausage.

807
00:48:01,658 --> 00:48:04,658
I cut the octopus sausage.

808
00:48:04,658 --> 00:48:09,658
There were a lot of flowers inside.

809
00:48:09,658 --> 00:48:13,658
Thank you for the meal.

810
00:48:13,658 --> 00:48:16,658
We talked about food a lot.

811
00:48:16,658 --> 00:48:20,658
I'm hungry.

812
00:48:20,658 --> 00:48:24,658
We talked about food a lot.

813
00:48:24,658 --> 00:48:28,658
Kokubo was the MC today.

814
00:48:28,658 --> 00:48:31,658
How was it?

815
00:48:31,658 --> 00:48:42,658
I thought Yuno would come to the show.

816
00:48:42,658 --> 00:48:44,658
I expected it.

817
00:48:44,658 --> 00:48:48,658
Yunopi's MC is getting better.

818
00:48:48,658 --> 00:48:49,658
I'm glad.

819
00:48:49,658 --> 00:48:52,658
Yunopi looks a little mature.

820
00:48:52,658 --> 00:48:56,658
It was the best.

821
00:48:56,658 --> 00:48:58,658
I'm glad.

822
00:48:58,658 --> 00:49:02,658
How was it?

823
00:49:02,658 --> 00:49:08,658
The first time was with Yuna.

824
00:49:08,658 --> 00:49:14,658
I was glad to be able to be a senior.

825
00:49:14,658 --> 00:49:17,658
You are a senior.

826
00:49:17,658 --> 00:49:20,658
Yuna is the same age as you.

827
00:49:20,658 --> 00:49:22,658
We are all 15 years old.

828
00:49:22,658 --> 00:49:25,760
Yes.

829
00:49:25,760 --> 00:49:27,760
Only the coconut is different.

830
00:49:27,760 --> 00:49:28,760
I see.

831
00:49:28,760 --> 00:49:34,760
Well, you know, you two look like older sisters.

832
00:49:34,760 --> 00:49:35,760
What?

833
00:49:39,760 --> 00:49:40,760
Cute.

834
00:49:40,760 --> 00:49:51,760
This week, or rather, the showroom is during Christmas, so everyone is wearing
hats and doing live streaming.

835
00:49:51,760 --> 00:49:55,760
This is the first time I've seen everyone wearing reindeer hats.

836
00:49:55,760 --> 00:49:56,760
I see.

837
00:49:56,760 --> 00:50:00,760
Doremu prepared a lot of hats for us.

838
00:50:00,760 --> 00:50:04,760
Everyone is wearing reindeer hats.

839
00:50:04,760 --> 00:50:12,760
Usually, Santa Claus is in the middle, but this time, the middle looks like a
strong reindeer.

840
00:50:12,760 --> 00:50:16,760
It's like a reindeer herd.

841
00:50:16,760 --> 00:50:21,760
It's like a reindeer herd.

842
00:50:21,760 --> 00:50:24,760
That's what I'm talking about.

843
00:50:24,760 --> 00:50:25,760
That's good.

844
00:50:25,760 --> 00:50:28,760
It's all reindeer.

845
00:50:28,760 --> 00:50:30,760
There's no main character, is there?

846
00:50:30,760 --> 00:50:33,760
Well, it's up to you.

847
00:50:33,760 --> 00:50:35,760
That's about it.

848
00:50:35,760 --> 00:50:39,760
Well, the year is over, so please look forward to next year.

849
00:50:39,760 --> 00:50:43,760
I think there will be a lot of live streaming next year.

850
00:50:43,760 --> 00:50:48,760
I've said that there are 26 hats, but I think there are 27 hats in total.

851
00:50:48,760 --> 00:50:49,760
Oh!

852
00:50:49,760 --> 00:50:52,760
I don't think there's enough.

853
00:50:52,760 --> 00:50:55,760
We have to do it next year.

854
00:50:55,760 --> 00:51:01,760
I want to do it for everyone's birthday next year.

855
00:51:01,760 --> 00:51:03,760
Because it's Yuno's birthday next year.

856
00:51:03,760 --> 00:51:04,760
Oh, that's right.

857
00:51:04,760 --> 00:51:09,760
Yuno's birthday is March 16th, so I want to do 16 hats.

858
00:51:09,760 --> 00:51:13,760
You're saying, it's coming out soon.

859
00:51:13,760 --> 00:51:15,760
It's coming out soon.

860
00:51:15,760 --> 00:51:18,760
Let's say one at a time at the end.

861
00:51:18,760 --> 00:51:21,760
Let's go like this.

862
00:51:21,760 --> 00:51:27,760
The color of my eyes is beautiful.

863
00:51:27,760 --> 00:51:32,760
My bangs are always beautiful.

864
00:51:32,760 --> 00:51:38,760
My manager often says that I look like a child when I eat sweets.

865
00:51:38,760 --> 00:51:43,760
Your manager says that, not you.

866
00:51:43,760 --> 00:51:54,760
I like new gummies and Mayaba, so if you bring me Haichu, I'll give you some
sweets.

867
00:51:54,760 --> 00:51:56,760
That's good.

868
00:51:56,760 --> 00:51:58,760
Thank you very much.

869
00:51:58,760 --> 00:52:00,760
See you again.

870
00:52:00,760 --> 00:52:06,310
Happy New Year.

871
00:52:06,310 --> 00:52:08,370
you

872
00:52:36,310 --> 00:52:38,370
you

873
00:53:06,310 --> 00:53:08,370
you
