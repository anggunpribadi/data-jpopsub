This time, we will be thinking about the composition of the fireworks produced by the GuuGoo performers that will be set off at the Munakata Festival 2023 finale! ðŸŽ‡

Following the picture book location, Kiyama and Ueda went to Fukuoka High School attached to Tokai University to borrow the help of local students! âœ¨

Where can we display the original fireworks of R Fujimoto, Kiyamaue, and Den that we made on location last time? ?

Fireworks to the music of Batten Girls' Team! ?

What kind of fireworks display was completed with the help of students? ðŸ‘€

Munakata Festival 2023 fireworks will be held on Sunday, November 5th from 19:00 to 19:30!
If you can't come to the venue, let's watch together on GuuGoo's live streamingâœ¨
