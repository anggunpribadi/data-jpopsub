 We are TOKIMEKI ADVERTISEMENT!

 Did you notice?

00:44.282 --> 00:46.282
 Look at this!

00:46.282 --> 00:49.282
 We look like models!

00:49.282 --> 00:55.282
 Today, we are shooting a collaboration
video with Tokimeki Advertisement and
Spince!

00:55.282 --> 00:59.282
 It's so fun!

00:59.282 --> 01:07.282
 We are going to be models for fashion
this time, so we are wearing the same
clothes.

01:07.282 --> 01:11.282
 We are wearing girly clothes.

01:11.282 --> 01:13.282
 Look! We changed the color!

01:13.282 --> 01:15.282
 It's a coincidence.

01:15.282 --> 01:19.282
 The stylist chose the color for us.

01:19.282 --> 01:21.282
 It's so fresh!

01:21.282 --> 01:22.282
 It's so fresh!

01:22.282 --> 01:24.282
 We don't usually do this.

01:24.282 --> 01:27.282
 I love wearing casual clothes.

01:27.282 --> 01:29.282
 It's like a shop.

01:29.282 --> 01:30.282
 It's so fresh!

01:30.282 --> 01:31.282
 Look at the back.

01:31.282 --> 01:34.282
 It's fashionable!

01:34.282 --> 01:37.282
 It's a fashionable look.

01:37.282 --> 01:40.282
 We are wearing a scarf like a princess.

01:40.282 --> 01:42.282
 It's like a princess.

01:42.282 --> 01:44.282
 It's cute.

01:44.282 --> 01:46.282
 I'm so happy.

01:46.282 --> 01:50.282
 I'm wearing an outerwear and she is
wearing a scarf.

01:50.282 --> 01:52.282
 It's so fun.

01:52.282 --> 01:57.282
 We are going to be like Bambi in
autumn.

01:57.282 --> 01:59.282
 Yeah!

01:59.282 --> 02:10.874
 We are going to enjoy it!

02:10.874 --> 02:12.874
 Wow, it's so stylish!

02:12.874 --> 02:14.874
 Cute!

02:22.138 --> 02:27.138
 We took a photo on the fashion page for
the first time.

02:27.138 --> 02:30.138
 We are a tweed style.

02:30.138 --> 02:32.138
 We are a girly style.

02:32.138 --> 02:34.138
 We are not cute.

02:35.138 --> 02:40.138
 We all have similar clothes.

02:40.138 --> 02:42.138
 I like this style.

02:42.138 --> 02:44.138
 I was very happy.

02:44.138 --> 02:47.138
 We were searched maturely.

02:47.138 --> 02:50.138
 Bambi doesn't look like a middle school
student.

02:50.138 --> 02:54.138
 We were searched maturely.

02:54.138 --> 02:57.138
 Middle school students are very
popular.

02:57.138 --> 03:00.138
 We were searched maturely.

03:00.138 --> 03:03.138
 I was searched maturely.

03:03.138 --> 03:06.138
 Please speak softly.

03:14.808 --> 03:18.808
 I'm wearing brown color LATTE.

03:19.808 --> 03:21.808
 I wore this color outerwear.

03:22.808 --> 03:26.808
 I matched with this LATTE color.

03:27.808 --> 03:29.808
 I wore this for the first time. It's so
cute.

03:30.808 --> 03:35.808
 This is easy to match with a turtleneck
skirt.

03:36.808 --> 03:39.808
 It's easy to wear even one.

03:40.808 --> 03:41.808
 Please check it out.

03:41.808 --> 03:42.808

03:45.808 --> 03:46.808
 It's cute.

03:46.808 --> 03:47.808
 It's cute.

03:50.936 --> 03:52.936
 I'll wear this outerwear.

03:53.936 --> 03:56.936
 I feel gorgeous just by wearing this.

03:58.936 --> 04:00.936
 It's warm because it's winter.

04:00.936 --> 04:01.936
 It's warm.

04:01.936 --> 04:02.936
 It's warm.

04:02.936 --> 04:03.936
 It's cute.

04:03.936 --> 04:04.936
 It's comfortable to touch.

04:04.936 --> 04:05.936
 It's comfortable.

04:06.936 --> 04:07.936
 Please touch it.

04:08.936 --> 04:09.936
 It's comfortable.

04:10.936 --> 04:11.936
 And this.

04:12.936 --> 04:13.936
 I thought it was cute.

04:14.936 --> 04:15.936
 I want you to see this.

04:16.936 --> 04:18.936
 There is a bear.

04:18.936 --> 04:19.936
 I'm in love with a bear.

04:22.936 --> 04:26.936
 I'm wearing a hair style and hair
arrangement in a modern way.

04:26.936 --> 04:27.936
 It's a new style.

04:27.936 --> 04:29.936
 I always wear a hair tie.

04:29.936 --> 04:33.936
 I thought it would be good to try this
style.

04:34.936 --> 04:36.936
 I'm wearing a nice outfit.

04:36.936 --> 04:39.936

04:49.416 --> 04:51.416
 I wanted to wear this kind of clothes.

04:52.416 --> 04:53.416
 I'm so happy.

04:59.416 --> 05:01.416
 Everyone has roses.

05:02.416 --> 05:03.416
 Really?

05:03.416 --> 05:04.416
 It's true.

05:04.416 --> 05:05.416
 Yeah!

05:06.416 --> 05:08.416
 Let's go to the rose field!

05:10.416 --> 05:11.416
 I'm going to take a picture of roses.

05:11.416 --> 05:30.416

05:30.522 --> 05:32.522
 It was fun.

05:32.522 --> 05:34.522
 It was fun.

05:34.522 --> 05:39.522
 We are like street fashion.

05:39.522 --> 05:40.522
 We are cool.

05:40.522 --> 05:42.522
 We are cool.

05:42.522 --> 05:44.522
 We have never worn this color.

05:44.522 --> 05:49.522
 This is the first time to wear this
color.

05:49.522 --> 05:50.522
 We are cool.

05:50.522 --> 05:52.176
 Please subscribe to our channel.

05:53.176 --> 05:54.176
 It's a new style.

05:57.176 --> 05:59.176
 We can't wear this kind of clothes
normally.

06:00.176 --> 06:02.176
 I haven't worn this kind of clothes for
shooting.

06:03.176 --> 06:06.176
 It was a new challenge and I enjoyed
it.

06:06.176 --> 06:08.848
 Please subscribe to our channel.

06:09.848 --> 06:11.848
 I have glasses.

06:15.848 --> 06:20.848
 I don't usually wear transparent
glasses, so it was very new.

06:21.848 --> 06:23.848
 It was fun.

06:23.848 --> 06:26.848
 We want to do it again.

06:34.522 --> 06:39.282
 The last is constante

06:41.082 --> 06:43.082
 It's cute!

06:43.082 --> 06:46.082
 Isn't this necklace cute?

06:46.082 --> 06:48.082
 It's cute!

06:52.752 --> 06:54.752
 I like this jacket.

06:54.752 --> 06:56.752
 It's cute.

06:56.752 --> 06:58.752
 I can wear this alone.

06:58.752 --> 07:00.752
 It's amazing.

07:00.752 --> 07:02.752
 It's cute.

07:02.752 --> 07:04.752
 It's warm.

07:04.752 --> 07:06.752
 It's warm.

07:06.752 --> 07:08.752
 It's light.

07:08.752 --> 07:10.752
 It's light.

07:10.752 --> 07:12.752
 It's light.

07:14.752 --> 07:16.752
 It's simple and cute.

07:16.752 --> 07:20.752
 I recommend this to everyone.

07:37.018 --> 07:45.018
 I'm so happy that I can collaborate
with Toki-sen and make products again.

07:45.018 --> 08:01.018
 I'm glad that I can make products with
three different styles of clothes.

08:01.018 --> 08:06.018
 I'm sure you'll see us in a different
way.

08:06.018 --> 08:14.018
 This jacket is a street style and looks
cool.

08:14.018 --> 08:19.018
 I think it'll be stylish and cool if I
wear this one.

08:19.018 --> 08:22.018
 It's warm and I like it.

08:22.018 --> 08:28.018
 It's one size, so it's a little big for
me.

08:28.018 --> 08:33.018
 But, it's stylish if I wear it a
little.

08:33.018 --> 08:38.018
 It's a monotone color, so it's easy to
match with anything.

08:38.018 --> 08:41.018
 You may think it's cool.

08:41.018 --> 08:46.018
 But, if I take it off, the sweater
inside will be...

08:46.018 --> 08:50.018
 It's a collaboration product.

08:50.018 --> 08:54.018
 It's brown and casual.

08:54.018 --> 08:57.018
 Can you see the back?

08:57.018 --> 09:02.018
 It's casual with a lock on the back.

09:02.018 --> 09:04.018
 I can wear it in a cool way.

09:04.018 --> 09:13.018
 It's brown, so I think it'll be cute to
wear it with a brown skirt or pants.

09:13.018 --> 09:15.018
 And, this one.

09:15.018 --> 09:17.018
 It's Toki-sen's color.

09:17.018 --> 09:18.018
 And this one.

09:18.018 --> 09:20.018
 It's the same key ring.

09:20.018 --> 09:23.018
 It's Tokimeki-sen's.

09:23.018 --> 09:25.018
 I like it.

09:25.018 --> 09:31.018
 I got them one by one and I'll put them
on my school bag.

09:31.018 --> 09:36.018
 It's colorful and poppy, so I think
it'll be cute.

09:36.018 --> 09:41.018
 It's cute to wear it with a simple bag.

09:41.018 --> 09:46.018
 It's made of silicon, so it's not
fragile.

09:46.018 --> 09:52.018
 I have three collaboration products, so
please try them on and enjoy them!

09:52.018 --> 09:59.930
 That's all for today. Thank you for
watching!

09:59.930 --> 10:01.930
 Thank you very much!

10:04.736 --> 10:11.736
 We've finished our collaboration with
Petose Pins!

10:11.736 --> 10:20.736
 We're wearing a set, jacket and key
chain.

10:20.736 --> 10:24.736
 They're all so cute and easy to wear.

10:24.736 --> 10:28.736
 They're warm and soft.

10:28.736 --> 10:30.736
 They're cute.

10:30.736 --> 10:34.736
 We also divided the sets into 3
categories.

10:34.736 --> 10:43.736
 We had a lot of fun shooting in 3
categories.

10:43.736 --> 10:47.736
 Please try to get these items.

10:47.736 --> 10:49.736
 They're all stylish.

10:49.736 --> 10:51.736
 You can wear them in various ways.

10:51.736 --> 10:54.736
 Please enjoy wearing them in your
favorite way.

10:54.736 --> 10:57.736
 Please try to wear them in our way.

10:57.736 --> 11:00.736
 Please check them out.

11:00.736 --> 11:03.736
 See you!

11:08.762 --> 11:12.762
 I'm sure I'll be satisfied.

11:12.762 --> 11:13.762
 I'll surpass.

11:13.762 --> 11:14.762
 I'll surpass.

11:14.762 --> 11:17.762
 I'll record it forever.

11:17.762 --> 11:19.762
 I'll make you satisfied.

11:19.762 --> 11:29.530
 I'll make you satisfied.

11:31.232 --> 11:35.232
 This is the last show to show the final
performance.

11:35.232 --> 11:39.232
 So, I think the excitement is the most
important thing in this year.

11:39.232 --> 11:42.232
 This is a big and important show for
us.

11:42.232 --> 11:45.232
 We can't finish this year without this
show.

11:45.232 --> 11:50.232
 I think this is a show that we can
connect with everyone and share our
feelings.

11:50.232 --> 11:56.232
 We have been working hard for this year
to make this show a success.

11:56.232 --> 12:01.232
 So, I want to say to everyone that this
is a very important show for us.

12:01.232 --> 12:06.232
 I want to have a good show every year.

12:06.232 --> 12:11.232
 I want to make a good show with
everyone.

12:17.232 --> 12:23.232
 I want to show the old Toki-san of
Iwamura.

12:23.232 --> 12:27.232
 I think that Toki-san is the brightest
at that time.

12:27.232 --> 12:32.232
 I want everyone to see the show that we
are going to do.

12:32.232 --> 12:39.232
 If you want to come, please come to the
show.

12:39.232 --> 12:43.232
 We will definitely make a legendary
show.

12:43.232 --> 12:47.232
 If you want to come, please come.

12:47.232 --> 12:50.232
 We will show you the show that you
can't miss now.

12:50.232 --> 12:56.232
 I want everyone to come to the Toki-
san's live show with a smile.

13:20.128 --> 13:23.768
 E까지

13:43.130 --> 13:47.130
 Aqua Area!

13:47.130 --> 13:50.130
