00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Ebichu's videos

2
00:00:18,362 --> 00:00:20,362
What is this?

3
00:00:20,362 --> 00:00:22,362
It's a blackout.

4
00:00:22,362 --> 00:00:24,362
I don't know.

5
00:00:24,362 --> 00:00:26,362
I don't know at all.

6
00:00:26,362 --> 00:00:28,362
What is it?

7
00:00:30,362 --> 00:00:32,362
I don't know if you're doing it.

8
00:00:32,362 --> 00:00:34,362
Blackout?

9
00:00:34,362 --> 00:00:36,362
But I didn't work much.

10
00:00:36,362 --> 00:00:38,362
I didn't work.

11
00:00:38,362 --> 00:00:40,362
It's actually very strong.

12
00:00:40,362 --> 00:00:42,362
Oh, it's strong.

13
00:00:42,362 --> 00:00:44,362
Maybe.

14
00:00:44,362 --> 00:00:48,314
Maybe.

15
00:00:48,314 --> 00:00:50,314
I don't know.

16
00:00:50,314 --> 00:00:52,314
But I didn't work.

17
00:00:52,314 --> 00:00:54,314
In the MV.

18
00:00:54,314 --> 00:00:56,314
I was drinking tea cups.

19
00:00:56,314 --> 00:00:58,314
I was drinking tea all the time.

20
00:00:58,314 --> 00:01:00,314
I didn't know.

21
00:01:00,314 --> 00:01:02,314
I don't know.

22
00:01:02,314 --> 00:01:04,314
TKG?

23
00:01:04,314 --> 00:01:06,314
TKG.

24
00:01:06,314 --> 00:01:08,314
TKG.

25
00:01:10,314 --> 00:01:12,314
TKG.

26
00:01:12,314 --> 00:01:13,696
It's cute inside.

27
00:01:14,696 --> 00:01:18,696
I'm watching while drinking tea.

28
00:01:18,696 --> 00:01:21,696
I'm sure she's been watching all along.

29
00:01:21,696 --> 00:01:23,696
It's a measure.

30
00:01:27,696 --> 00:01:29,696
It's a measure.

31
00:01:29,696 --> 00:01:31,696
It's difficult.

32
00:01:31,696 --> 00:01:33,696
Is it a measure?

33
00:01:33,696 --> 00:01:35,696
Wow.

34
00:01:35,696 --> 00:01:37,696
Did you get it right?

35
00:01:37,696 --> 00:01:39,696
But you need a clue.

36
00:01:39,696 --> 00:01:41,696
I don't have a clue.

37
00:01:41,696 --> 00:01:42,080
I'm not sure.

38
00:01:42,080 --> 00:01:44,080
I don't know.

39
00:01:44,080 --> 00:01:46,080
I'm going to think about it.

40
00:01:46,080 --> 00:01:48,080
It's not a problem.

41
00:01:48,080 --> 00:01:50,080
It's not what I said.

42
00:01:50,080 --> 00:01:52,080
I'm going to be minused.

43
00:01:52,080 --> 00:01:54,080
I'm sad.

44
00:01:54,080 --> 00:01:56,080
I'm scared.

45
00:01:56,080 --> 00:01:58,080
Let's make up for it.

46
00:01:58,080 --> 00:02:00,080
It's scary to be minused.

47
00:02:00,080 --> 00:02:02,080
It's pretty hard.

48
00:02:02,080 --> 00:02:04,080
It's pretty hard.

49
00:02:04,080 --> 00:02:06,080
What is the answer?

50
00:02:06,080 --> 00:02:08,080
I don't know.

51
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:09,600
I don't know.

52
00:02:10,600 --> 00:02:12,600
What's the problem?

53
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:17,600
What's the problem?

54
00:02:18,600 --> 00:02:20,600
I don't want to get minus 2 points.

55
00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:23,600
I'm really scared.

56
00:02:26,600 --> 00:02:28,600
It's been 5 years.

57
00:02:29,600 --> 00:02:31,600
It's been 5 years?

58
00:02:32,600 --> 00:02:34,600
It's 2015.

59
00:02:34,600 --> 00:02:36,600
That's right.

60
00:02:36,600 --> 00:02:38,600
It's been 5 years.

61
00:02:39,898 --> 00:02:41,898
I don't remember at all.

62
00:02:41,898 --> 00:02:43,898
I don't remember at all.

63
00:02:43,898 --> 00:02:45,898
I don't remember at all.

64
00:02:45,898 --> 00:02:47,898
I didn't want to say it.

65
00:02:49,898 --> 00:02:51,898
A child came.

66
00:02:51,898 --> 00:02:53,898
A child.

67
00:02:53,898 --> 00:02:57,898
At the end, A-chan was trying to stop
the moving boy.

68
00:03:01,898 --> 00:03:03,898
I think so.

69
00:03:03,898 --> 00:03:05,328
I think so.

70
00:03:06,328 --> 00:03:11,328
I remember when I was a kid, I saw a lot
of kids playing with firecrackers.

71
00:03:12,328 --> 00:03:13,328
I remember that.

72
00:03:14,328 --> 00:03:15,328
I remember that.

73
00:03:19,328 --> 00:03:20,328
It's a tie.

74
00:03:21,328 --> 00:03:22,328
It's a tie.

75
00:03:24,328 --> 00:03:27,328
She still comes to the special event.

76
00:03:27,328 --> 00:03:28,328
What? 2 points.

77
00:03:28,328 --> 00:03:32,328
I couldn't answer that.

78
00:03:34,744 --> 00:03:36,744
She's not crying anymore?

79
00:03:36,744 --> 00:03:38,744
She's always smiling.

80
00:03:41,744 --> 00:03:43,744
She's watching over her growth.

81
00:03:43,744 --> 00:03:45,744
We're getting along.

82
00:03:47,744 --> 00:03:49,744
So Aya-chan, minus one point?

83
00:03:49,744 --> 00:03:51,744
Really?

84
00:03:54,744 --> 00:03:56,744
Really?

85
00:03:56,744 --> 00:03:58,744
This is bad.

86
00:03:58,744 --> 00:04:01,744
To be continued...

87
00:04:01,914 --> 00:04:03,914
I remember!

88
00:04:03,914 --> 00:04:05,914
Did I wake up right after departure?

89
00:04:05,914 --> 00:04:07,914
I remember!

90
00:04:07,914 --> 00:04:09,914
Place?

91
00:04:09,914 --> 00:04:11,914
What should I do?

92
00:04:11,914 --> 00:04:13,914
You went to play!

93
00:04:13,914 --> 00:04:15,914
I went!

94
00:04:15,914 --> 00:04:17,914
What happened to that?

95
00:04:17,914 --> 00:04:19,914
I know the place!

96
00:04:19,914 --> 00:04:21,914
I know the place!

97
00:04:21,914 --> 00:04:23,914
I remembered the name!

98
00:04:23,914 --> 00:04:25,914
It was pretty early in the morning.

99
00:04:25,914 --> 00:04:27,914
I don't remember because it was early in
the morning.

100
00:04:27,914 --> 00:04:29,840
It was early.

101
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:31,840
I was worried because there were so many
cars.

102
00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:37,840
I can do this.

103
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:39,840
Ta-da!

104
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:41,840
Cosmo World!

105
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:47,840
I think it's a good one.

106
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:51,840
Cosmo World!

107
00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:55,840
I remember the trunk door was open and I
heard a beep.

108
00:04:55,840 --> 00:04:57,840
That's it!

109
00:04:59,552 --> 00:05:01,552
The answer is...

110
00:05:01,552 --> 00:05:03,552
The answer is...

111
00:05:03,552 --> 00:05:05,552
The app was playing the song.

112
00:05:05,552 --> 00:05:07,552
Mirei, you got it right!

113
00:05:07,552 --> 00:05:09,552
I got it right?

114
00:05:09,552 --> 00:05:11,552
I got 2 points!

115
00:05:11,552 --> 00:05:13,552
I did it!

116
00:05:13,552 --> 00:05:15,552
When I put the app in the app store,

117
00:05:15,552 --> 00:05:17,552
the app wasn't closed.

118
00:05:17,552 --> 00:05:19,552
But I kept saying PP.

119
00:05:19,552 --> 00:05:21,552
I didn't know what to do.

120
00:05:21,552 --> 00:05:23,552
I see.

121
00:05:23,552 --> 00:05:25,552
I was panicking because everyone was on
it.

122
00:05:25,552 --> 00:05:27,552
I see.

123
00:05:27,552 --> 00:05:28,304
I see.

124
00:05:29,304 --> 00:05:31,304
I'm scared of human's decadence.

125
00:05:34,304 --> 00:05:37,304
Cosmo World is totally different from
the one above.

126
00:05:38,304 --> 00:05:40,304
Minato Mirai is the best.

127
00:05:40,304 --> 00:05:41,304
I thought it was Chugabai.

128
00:05:41,304 --> 00:05:42,304
That's right.

129
00:05:42,304 --> 00:05:43,304
That's right.

130
00:05:43,304 --> 00:05:45,304
It's right, but it's not.

131
00:05:47,304 --> 00:05:50,304
Let's be careful about our memories.

132
00:05:50,304 --> 00:05:51,304
It's amazing.

133
00:05:51,304 --> 00:05:52,720
I'm scared of human's decadence.

134
00:05:53,720 --> 00:05:57,720
What happens to the oldest child if the
youngest child is so old?

135
00:05:57,720 --> 00:05:59,720
I'm so upset.

136
00:05:59,720 --> 00:06:01,720
The oldest child is the youngest child.

137
00:06:01,720 --> 00:06:03,720
The oldest child is the youngest child.

138
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:06,720
I don't know.

139
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:08,720
I don't know.

140
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:10,720
I don't know.

141
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:12,720
We don't talk about this.

142
00:06:13,720 --> 00:06:16,720
I think I've heard this before.

143
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:18,720
I think I've heard this before.

144
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:20,720
I was talking about this on the show.

145
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:21,312
I think I've heard this before.

146
00:06:22,312 --> 00:06:28,312
I think it was during the tour.

147
00:06:29,312 --> 00:06:33,312
I remember saying that at the end of the
show, but I don't know where.

148
00:06:33,312 --> 00:06:35,752
What I just did was sumo matches.

149
00:06:35,752 --> 00:06:38,800
Let's try fine stroke using ot slices

150
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:40,800
You don't get tired of teasing?

151
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:42,800
Hey!

152
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:44,800
I don't get tired of teasing.

153
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:46,800
You always lose.

154
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:48,800
You always play with me like that.

155
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:50,800
I only play with you.

156
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:54,800
If it's time like this, I won't wake up.

157
00:06:56,800 --> 00:06:58,800
I'm here.

158
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:02,800
I'm here.

159
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:04,800
I'm here.

160
00:07:08,432 --> 00:07:10,412
it was a cat

161
00:07:16,954 --> 00:07:20,954
It was the last day of the solo tour.

162
00:07:20,954 --> 00:07:22,954
The last day?

163
00:07:22,954 --> 00:07:24,954
The answer is...

164
00:07:24,954 --> 00:07:26,954
I'm worried

165
00:07:27,184 --> 00:07:29,184
I see.

166
00:07:29,184 --> 00:07:31,184
It's impossible.

167
00:07:31,184 --> 00:07:33,184
It's difficult.

168
00:07:33,184 --> 00:07:35,184
It's difficult.

169
00:07:35,184 --> 00:07:39,184
If I were in this situation, I wouldn't
know anything about baseball.

170
00:07:39,184 --> 00:07:41,184
I don't know.

171
00:07:41,184 --> 00:07:43,184
I wonder where you were happy.

172
00:07:43,184 --> 00:07:45,184
I don't know.

173
00:07:45,184 --> 00:07:47,184
It was Nagano.

174
00:07:47,184 --> 00:07:49,184
I'm sorry.

175
00:07:49,184 --> 00:07:51,184
I'm sorry.

176
00:07:51,482 --> 00:07:53,482
The name of the store?

177
00:07:53,482 --> 00:07:55,482
I was struck back.

178
00:07:55,482 --> 00:07:57,482
I was struck back.

179
00:07:57,482 --> 00:07:59,482
I was struck back.

180
00:07:59,482 --> 00:08:01,482
I was struck back.

181
00:08:01,482 --> 00:08:03,482
I told you not to strike back.

182
00:08:03,482 --> 00:08:05,482
I was struck back.

183
00:08:05,482 --> 00:08:07,482
I can't return it.

184
00:08:07,482 --> 00:08:09,482
But

185
00:08:09,482 --> 00:08:11,482
Riko and Hinata

186
00:08:11,482 --> 00:08:13,482
You know, don't you?

187
00:08:13,482 --> 00:08:15,482
I think we were together.

188
00:08:15,482 --> 00:08:17,482
I wrote the name of the store.

189
00:08:17,482 --> 00:08:19,482
I wrote the name of the store.

190
00:08:19,482 --> 00:08:21,482
Oh, my God.

191
00:08:21,482 --> 00:08:23,482
It's amazing.

192
00:08:23,482 --> 00:08:25,482
It's really

193
00:08:25,482 --> 00:08:27,482
It's a dark history for me.

194
00:08:27,482 --> 00:08:29,482
I don't remember anything else.

195
00:08:29,482 --> 00:08:31,482
I don't remember anything else.

196
00:08:31,482 --> 00:08:33,482
I don't remember anything else.

197
00:08:33,482 --> 00:08:35,482
I don't remember anything else.

198
00:08:35,482 --> 00:08:37,482
I'm so embarrassed.

199
00:08:37,482 --> 00:08:39,482
I'm so embarrassed.

200
00:08:40,600 --> 00:08:42,600
This is difficult.

201
00:08:43,600 --> 00:08:44,600
I don't know.

202
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:48,600
It's a very similar name.

203
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:50,600
It's true.

204
00:08:50,600 --> 00:08:51,600
I'm scared.

205
00:08:57,146 --> 00:08:59,146
I don't know.

206
00:08:59,146 --> 00:09:01,146
I don't know.

207
00:09:01,146 --> 00:09:03,146
I'm sorry.

208
00:09:03,146 --> 00:09:05,146
It's difficult.

209
00:09:05,146 --> 00:09:07,146
It's very elegant.

210
00:09:07,146 --> 00:09:09,146
Let's go to Hokkaido next time.

211
00:09:09,146 --> 00:09:11,146
I don't have a name that has a sense of
Hokkaido.

212
00:09:11,146 --> 00:09:13,146
Let's go.

213
00:09:13,146 --> 00:09:15,146
Let's go together next time we go to
Hokkaido.

214
00:09:15,146 --> 00:09:17,146
Let's go.

215
00:09:17,146 --> 00:09:19,146
We can eat it now.

216
00:09:19,146 --> 00:09:21,146
Let's go.

217
00:09:21,146 --> 00:09:23,146
Let's have it taken for making.

218
00:09:23,146 --> 00:09:25,146
Let's do that.

219
00:09:25,146 --> 00:09:27,146
We need to rewrite history.

220
00:09:27,146 --> 00:09:29,146
We need to rewrite history.

221
00:09:29,146 --> 00:09:31,146
It's a big story.

222
00:09:31,146 --> 00:09:33,146
We need to rewrite history.

223
00:09:33,146 --> 00:09:35,146
We need to rewrite history.

224
00:09:35,146 --> 00:09:36,378
Let's do that.

225
00:09:36,378 --> 00:09:38,378
Thank you very much!

226
00:09:38,592 --> 00:09:42,592
What's that? Why did you say it was
100,000 yen?

227
00:09:42,592 --> 00:09:44,592
I don't think everyone knows this.

228
00:09:44,592 --> 00:09:46,592
I've never heard of it.

229
00:09:46,592 --> 00:09:48,592
I've never heard of it.

230
00:09:48,592 --> 00:09:52,592
When did you say that?

231
00:09:52,592 --> 00:09:54,592
Where did you say that?

232
00:09:54,592 --> 00:09:58,592
I did a talk show alone at Singalong
Singason.

233
00:09:58,592 --> 00:10:02,592
I told the fans for the first time at
that time, so they weren't there.

234
00:10:02,592 --> 00:10:04,592
Oh, I see.

235
00:10:04,592 --> 00:10:06,592
Thank you for buying it.

236
00:10:06,592 --> 00:10:08,592
I bought it.

237
00:10:08,592 --> 00:10:10,592
I bought a picture of the first time.

238
00:10:10,592 --> 00:10:12,592
Thank you.

239
00:10:12,592 --> 00:10:18,592
It's amazing that one of the people who
bought it is a member.

240
00:10:18,592 --> 00:10:22,592
Thank you for watching.

241
00:10:22,832 --> 00:10:24,832
Bye!

242
00:10:24,832 --> 00:10:26,832
What? What do you mean?

243
00:10:27,344 --> 00:10:36,344
I was wearing a school uniform for the
ring festival.

244
00:10:36,344 --> 00:10:39,344
It was so cute.

245
00:10:39,344 --> 00:10:41,344
I wanted a picture of an idol.

246
00:10:41,344 --> 00:10:44,344
I wanted a picture of a cute girl.

247
00:10:44,344 --> 00:10:45,344
I'm sorry.

248
00:10:45,344 --> 00:10:50,344
And I bought it because I was told to
give me a new one.

249
00:10:50,344 --> 00:10:54,344
I was told that I was right.

250
00:10:57,562 --> 00:10:59,562
I was surprised.

251
00:10:59,562 --> 00:11:01,562
It was a very rock-like feeling.

252
00:11:01,562 --> 00:11:05,562
All the idols who were together were
playing the drums.

253
00:11:05,562 --> 00:11:09,562
I was surprised just by passing by.

254
00:11:09,562 --> 00:11:14,562
You were wearing a limousine to the
Budokan.

255
00:11:14,562 --> 00:11:16,562
That's right.

256
00:11:16,562 --> 00:11:21,562
I can't forget the face of Nogizaka at
that time.

257
00:11:21,562 --> 00:11:23,562
I can't forget.

258
00:11:23,562 --> 00:11:26,061
I can't forget.
