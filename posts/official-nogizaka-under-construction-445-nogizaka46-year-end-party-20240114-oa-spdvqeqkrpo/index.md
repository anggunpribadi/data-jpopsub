Nogizaka Under Construction this time, we take a peek at the 5th generation's very free year-end party, which will conclude in 2023!
We had a great time at the gift exchange event using personal items from home and the Nogizaka construction reflection award.
Furthermore, the chain of impressions is unstoppable! ? What is the reason for the tears? ?
The year-end party for 5th graders is a must-see, as it is very free but still feels like youth!
