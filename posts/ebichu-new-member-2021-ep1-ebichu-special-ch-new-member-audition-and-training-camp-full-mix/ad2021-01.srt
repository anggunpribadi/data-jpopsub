1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
To be continued...

2
00:00:02,202 --> 00:00:08,202
Happy New Year!

3
00:00:09,202 --> 00:00:15,202
On the day of 2021, the year-end party
was announced.

4
00:00:15,202 --> 00:00:28,202
The audition for the year-end party was
decided!

5
00:00:29,728 --> 00:00:34,728
Shiritu Ebisu Middle School New Member
Audition Start!

6
00:00:34,728 --> 00:00:39,728
The catch copy of the new member
audition is

7
00:00:39,728 --> 00:00:43,728
More! More! More! Ebichu!

8
00:00:43,728 --> 00:00:45,728
The catch copy is

9
00:00:45,728 --> 00:00:48,728
More! More! More! Ebichu!

10
00:00:48,728 --> 00:00:52,728
Let's increase the number of members
that are like Ebichu

11
00:00:52,728 --> 00:00:57,728
And the new member will be more powerful

12
00:00:57,728 --> 00:01:02,728
And the new member will be more
wonderful

13
00:01:02,728 --> 00:01:04,728
That's the catch copy

14
00:01:05,728 --> 00:01:07,728
March 1st

15
00:01:07,728 --> 00:01:10,728
The day after the audition is over

16
00:01:10,728 --> 00:01:14,728
The first screening of the audition will
start!

17
00:01:14,728 --> 00:01:17,728
The number of people who have gathered
is

18
00:01:17,728 --> 00:01:21,728
About 7,000

19
00:01:21,728 --> 00:01:24,728
The number of applicants is 7,000!

20
00:01:24,728 --> 00:01:27,728
I think it's a good number

21
00:01:27,728 --> 00:01:30,728
Because our new members told me

22
00:01:30,728 --> 00:01:33,392
Thank you for watching!

23
00:01:33,392 --> 00:01:36,412
Why not? 700?

24
00:01:36,832 --> 00:01:39,032
Thank you very much

25
00:01:39,032 --> 00:01:40,032
Yes

26
00:01:40,032 --> 00:01:56,314
16

27
00:01:56,314 --> 00:02:02,314
I'm looking for a man who's fit to be a
princess.

28
00:02:02,314 --> 00:02:05,314
Prince, that's me.

29
00:02:05,314 --> 00:02:10,314
Please make a contract with me.

30
00:02:10,314 --> 00:02:12,314
K.A.I.

31
00:02:12,314 --> 00:02:14,314
K.A.I.

32
00:02:14,314 --> 00:02:16,090
K.A.I.

33
00:02:16,090 --> 00:02:18,090
We're working hard!

34
00:02:19,090 --> 00:02:21,090
We're working hard!

35
00:02:22,090 --> 00:02:24,090
We're working hard!

36
00:02:24,090 --> 00:02:28,218
We're working hard!

37
00:02:28,218 --> 00:02:33,218
We're working hard, working hard

38
00:02:34,218 --> 00:02:39,218
Today, we're working hard for you

39
00:02:40,218 --> 00:02:46,218
Since Kobayashi Kaho and Riko Nakayama,
it's been 7 years since they've been new
members

40
00:02:46,218 --> 00:02:51,680
We managed to keep up with them!

41
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:55,680
I think we did the formation right.

42
00:02:57,680 --> 00:03:01,680
And the first audition will decide the
members.

43
00:03:02,680 --> 00:03:07,680
I think it will be interesting to see
who will be the first to enter the
shrimp house.

44
00:03:08,680 --> 00:03:11,680
What about the members?

45
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:21,680
If we were to divide the shrimp house
into stories, the first and second
auditions will be when Natsuhiro and
Mizuki switch and the two of them join.

46
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:25,680
I think this audition will be the
beginning of the third round.

47
00:03:26,680 --> 00:03:29,680
I'm looking forward to seeing what
changes will be made.

48
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:36,680
It's quite brave to be in an audition
for a group.

49
00:03:36,680 --> 00:03:52,680
But I think the members who will be in
the audition will want to see the
beautiful scenery with us.

50
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:59,680
So I was more excited and excited when I
was told to be in the audition.

51
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:06,680
I didn't think I would be in the
audition.

52
00:04:08,680 --> 00:04:13,680
It will be harder than when we were in
the audition.

53
00:04:14,680 --> 00:04:16,680
There are so many songs.

54
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:23,680
Ayaka will be in the audition and Hinata
will be in the dance lesson.

55
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:30,680
I think I can support them.

56
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:34,680
And Hoshina is talking about her
decision.

57
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:41,680
I was able to hear the voices of the six
people who wanted to see the shrimp
house more.

58
00:04:42,680 --> 00:04:44,680
I was able to hear the voices of the six
people who wanted to see the shrimp
house more.

59
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:49,680
I'm really grateful that they can say
that.

60
00:04:49,680 --> 00:05:04,680
I hope that new members will be in the
audition and I hope that new members
will be able to accept the new beauty.

61
00:05:04,680 --> 00:05:11,376
We are looking forward to seeing new
members.

62
00:05:11,376 --> 00:05:19,256
Next time, we will continue to find out!
