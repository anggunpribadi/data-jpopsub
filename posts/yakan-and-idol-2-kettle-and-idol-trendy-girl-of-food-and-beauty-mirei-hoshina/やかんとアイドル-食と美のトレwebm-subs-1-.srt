13
00:00:51,472 --> 00:00:54,472
I get Fruits Monster from my members a
lot.

14
00:00:54,472 --> 00:00:58,472
I get Fruits every day at home.

15
00:00:58,472 --> 00:01:02,472
I get seasonal Fruits.

16
00:01:02,472 --> 00:01:06,472
My mother loves Fruits.

17
00:01:06,472 --> 00:01:10,472
I got them from her.

18
00:01:10,472 --> 00:01:19,472
I started getting seasonal Fruits a
little before the season started.

19
00:01:19,472 --> 00:01:22,472
I thought it was normal.

20
00:01:22,472 --> 00:01:26,472
I was stressed out that I didn't get
Fruits.

21
00:01:26,472 --> 00:01:29,472
But I didn't have any.

22
00:01:29,472 --> 00:01:33,472
I was depressed and had a mouthache.

23
00:01:33,472 --> 00:01:34,472
I see.

24
00:01:34,472 --> 00:01:38,472
I got Fruits from her sometimes.

25
00:01:38,472 --> 00:01:40,472
I couldn't stop eating them.

26
00:01:40,472 --> 00:01:42,472
I was all by myself.

27
00:01:42,472 --> 00:01:43,472
I see.

28
00:01:43,472 --> 00:01:46,472
I was living a life of my own.

29
00:01:46,472 --> 00:01:49,472
I could eat Fruits as much as I wanted.

30
00:01:49,472 --> 00:01:52,472
I could eat cakes as much as I wanted.

31
00:01:52,472 --> 00:01:54,472
I grew up like that.

32
00:01:54,472 --> 00:01:56,472
You couldn't help it.

33
00:01:56,472 --> 00:02:00,472
I wanted to keep seasonal Fruits.

34
00:02:00,472 --> 00:02:02,472
But I couldn't stop.

35
00:02:02,472 --> 00:02:05,472
I ate only delicious Fruits.

36
00:02:05,472 --> 00:02:08,472

38
00:02:11,472 --> 00:02:15,472
You didn't get Fruits as main.

39
00:02:15,472 --> 00:02:16,472
I got some.

40
00:02:16,472 --> 00:02:18,472
What did you get?

41
00:02:18,472 --> 00:02:20,472
Pineapple.

42
00:02:20,472 --> 00:02:22,472

You eat Monsters in many ways.

I want to keep Monsters in my car.

59
00:02:52,472 --> 00:02:54,472
You become so energetic.

60
00:02:54,472 --> 00:02:58,472
I eat them in stand-by.

61
00:02:58,472 --> 00:03:01,472
I got a lower jaw recently.

62
00:03:01,472 --> 00:03:03,472
I thought I didn't know that.

63
00:03:03,472 --> 00:03:06,472
I got Kokubo Yuno.

64
00:03:06,472 --> 00:03:07,472
Did you get her?

00:03:07,472 --> 00:03:08,472
Yes.

66
00:03:08,472 --> 00:03:09,472

I didn't get Shine Mascato.

70
00:03:19,472 --> 00:03:22,472
You didn't get Shine Mascato.

71
00:03:22,472 --> 00:03:25,472
I thought I knew her.

72
00:03:25,472 --> 00:03:26,472
You knew her.

73
00:03:26,472 --> 00:03:28,472
She is not single.

74
00:03:28,472 --> 00:03:31,472
She is not single, but she likes fruits.

75
00:03:31,472 --> 00:03:33,472
She likes them in season.

00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:47,120
I really like Mouko-tanmen Nakamoto.

82
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:49,120
Mouko-tanmen, right?

83
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:50,620
I thought I'd go eat it later.

84
00:03:50,620 --> 00:03:52,120
You're going today?

85
00:03:52,120 --> 00:03:57,120
I went to the store the next day to eat
it.

86
00:03:57,120 --> 00:03:58,120
You're kidding, right?
