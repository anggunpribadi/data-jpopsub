00:00.000 --> 00:04.000
 Hello everyone!

00:04.000 --> 00:10.000
 Welcome to Kimi no Haato! We are
Tokimeki Sendai!

00:11.384 --> 00:15.564
 We are six here today.

00:16.184 --> 00:19.764
 Today, we will do a talk show!

00:20.404 --> 00:24.524
 Well, just a talk show won't make this
video interesting at all.

00:24.784 --> 00:26.964
 I do not touch the topic!

00:27.344 --> 00:28.204
 Oh, not good!

00:28.204 --> 00:29.884
 Yes it is!

00:29.884 --> 00:32.544
 This time easy part

00:34.192 --> 00:36.192
 Yay!

00:36.192 --> 00:37.192
 I'm sorry.

00:37.192 --> 00:39.192
 There was a bubble in the bubble in the
NG word battle.

00:39.192 --> 00:41.192
 I can't see it.

00:41.192 --> 00:43.192
 I can't see it.

00:43.192 --> 00:45.192
 What is NG word battle?

00:45.192 --> 00:50.192
 Everyone is wearing a hat and NG words
are written there.

00:50.192 --> 00:53.192
 I can't see it, but I can see people.

00:53.192 --> 00:56.192
 I'm trying to make people say NG words.

00:56.192 --> 00:57.192
 I see.

00:57.192 --> 00:58.192
 You don't know what you're saying.

00:58.192 --> 01:00.192
 You can't say the words.

01:00.192 --> 01:04.192
 We will talk about the topic.

01:04.192 --> 01:08.192
 If you say NG words, we will change the
hat and add a new NG word.

01:08.192 --> 01:10.192
 It will change.

01:10.192 --> 01:16.192
 The person who says the most NG words
in the time limit is the loser.

01:16.192 --> 01:18.192
 Yay!

01:18.192 --> 01:22.192
 Please subscribe to this channel.

01:22.394 --> 01:32.394
 This program is a program that tries
various things to promote something
exciting, and raises the excitement
barometer in the world.

01:53.658 --> 01:55.478
 But I'm still eating it

01:57.178 --> 01:59.418
 Yes, flauntingly

02:02.558 --> 02:03.998
 Good go?

02:04.598 --> 02:05.598
 Let's do this!!!

02:07.418 --> 02:08.478
 LET'S GO

02:08.538 --> 02:09.578
 Kiss but hesitant

02:10.958 --> 02:12.158
 Could it get a reaction

02:14.158 --> 02:15.238
 What's going on

02:16.118 --> 02:19.138
 do a beat

02:19.138 --> 02:20.282
 Subbed by Dreadopp and Zedopp.

02:20.282 --> 02:22.282
 Toshimae!

02:22.282 --> 02:24.282
 I see!

02:24.282 --> 02:28.282
 The winner is Toshimae!

02:28.282 --> 02:32.282
 Ready, set, go!

02:32.282 --> 02:37.282
 I want to go to the place where we shot
the music video.

02:37.282 --> 02:40.282
 I want to go to the concert.

02:40.282 --> 02:42.282
 What's wrong?

02:42.282 --> 02:44.282
 I'm sad.

02:44.282 --> 02:46.282
 I ate a lot.

02:46.282 --> 02:48.282
 How was the food?

02:48.282 --> 02:50.282
 It was delicious.

02:51.640 --> 02:53.640
 I ate a lot of it.

02:55.640 --> 02:57.640
 Have you ever eaten a big one?

02:57.640 --> 02:59.640
 You said you ate it at another
restaurant.

02:59.640 --> 03:01.640
 I ate it at a restaurant.

03:02.640 --> 03:03.640
 It was different taste.

03:03.640 --> 03:04.640
 Which one did you like?

03:06.640 --> 03:07.640
 I don't remember.

03:08.640 --> 03:12.640
 I like the one at the concert.

03:14.640 --> 03:15.640
 The one with water.

03:15.640 --> 03:17.640
 I like the one with water.

03:17.640 --> 03:18.640
 I like it.

03:20.176 --> 03:22.176
 People might talk like ''Water!!''

03:22.176 --> 03:24.176
 that's why I became really
conservative.

03:25.316 --> 03:28.636
 I see those people use women's place
above men's place.

03:32.136 --> 03:36.136
 Actually we were supposed to put符叉
around my head.

03:38.356 --> 03:41.376
 But Shiki-chan said it was Saya-can and
she is so scary...

03:44.076 --> 03:47.076
 At last, I have become said one.

03:47.076 --> 03:48.076
 That's all.

03:48.076 --> 03:49.076
 How about you, Piyo?

03:49.076 --> 03:51.076
 Me?

03:51.076 --> 03:55.076
 I used to be a cross-dresser.

03:55.076 --> 03:58.076
 You can do that kind of cross-dressing.

04:00.076 --> 04:02.076
 I get panicked.

04:02.076 --> 04:07.792
 Please subscribe to this channel.

04:08.792 --> 04:10.792
 Oh my god, it's so difficult.

04:10.792 --> 04:14.792
 I don't think they will say it.

04:14.792 --> 04:20.792
 I saw a ghost house on the internet.

04:20.792 --> 04:23.792
 You said you would go in with a cart.

04:23.792 --> 04:25.792
 There are two.

04:25.792 --> 04:30.792
 There is a Japanese-style ghost house
at the end.

04:30.792 --> 04:37.792
 There is another one near the merry-go-
round.

04:37.792 --> 04:40.792
 It's a ghost house that you ride a car
on a car.

04:40.792 --> 04:45.792
 It looks like a ghost house, but it's a
scary place.

04:45.792 --> 04:47.792
 I want to ride it.

04:47.792 --> 04:50.792
 Let's ride it together.

04:50.792 --> 04:52.792
 Juri is so good.

04:52.792 --> 04:54.792
 It looks fun.

04:54.792 --> 04:56.792
 What?

04:56.792 --> 04:58.792
 No, Juri is so good.

04:58.792 --> 05:00.792
 I got it.

05:00.792 --> 05:02.792
 It's a ghost house.

05:02.792 --> 05:04.792
 What did you think?

05:04.792 --> 05:06.792
 It was fun.

05:06.792 --> 05:08.792
 It was fun.

05:08.792 --> 05:10.792
 I think I got it.

05:10.792 --> 05:12.792
 I got it.

05:12.792 --> 05:15.504
 Please subscribe to this channel.

05:16.504 --> 05:17.504
 You are not good at talking.

05:17.504 --> 05:18.504
 Am I?

05:18.504 --> 05:19.504
 You are not good at talking.

05:19.504 --> 05:21.504
 I am not good at talking.

05:21.504 --> 05:30.330
 Please subscribe to this channel.

05:30.330 --> 05:32.330
 I want to change the topic here.

05:34.330 --> 05:35.330
 I'll change the topic.

05:35.330 --> 05:55.674
 The other way around.

05:55.674 --> 05:57.674
 Let's go to the second floor.

06:00.384 --> 06:04.384
 Kanami, you've been listening to music
lately, right?

06:04.384 --> 06:05.384
 Yes!

06:05.384 --> 06:07.384
 I did it!

06:07.384 --> 06:08.384
 I did it!

06:08.384 --> 06:11.384
 Yay!

06:11.384 --> 06:12.384
 You're the best!

06:12.384 --> 06:14.384
 I'm not!

06:14.384 --> 06:15.384
 I'm not, I'm Kanami.

06:15.384 --> 06:16.384
 That's right!

06:16.384 --> 06:18.384
 What?

06:18.384 --> 06:20.384
 You can't shake your hands.

06:20.384 --> 06:22.384
 That's why I always do it.

06:22.384 --> 06:24.384
 Like this.

06:24.384 --> 06:25.384
 That's amazing.

06:25.384 --> 06:30.384
 I might be able to do it.

06:37.978 --> 06:46.978
 What kind of project do you want to do?

06:46.978 --> 06:48.978
 Project?

06:48.978 --> 06:50.978
 What is it?

06:50.978 --> 06:53.978
 I don't sell my shoes.

06:53.978 --> 06:55.978
 You are fast.

06:55.978 --> 06:57.978
 Why?

06:57.978 --> 06:59.978
 Please look forward to it.

07:00.506 --> 07:02.506
 I knew you would say that.

07:02.506 --> 07:04.506
 This is easy.

07:04.506 --> 07:06.506
 Hey, you.

07:06.506 --> 07:08.506
 Hiori?

07:08.506 --> 07:10.506
 Hey, you.

07:10.506 --> 07:12.506
 It's Hiori.

07:12.506 --> 07:14.506
 It's Hiori.

07:14.506 --> 07:16.506
 Hey, you.

07:16.506 --> 07:18.506
 It's Hiori.

07:18.506 --> 07:20.506
 When you say about yourself,

07:20.506 --> 07:22.506
 you always say,

07:22.506 --> 07:32.442
 I'm Hiori.

07:32.442 --> 07:34.442
 Ready, go!

07:35.442 --> 07:37.442
 I'm curious about your specialty.

07:38.442 --> 07:39.442
 What is my specialty?

07:40.442 --> 07:41.442
 Specialty?

07:41.442 --> 07:42.442
 Specialty?

07:45.442 --> 07:46.442
 Specialty?

07:46.442 --> 07:47.442
 Recording?

07:51.442 --> 07:54.442
 I'll show you my favorite A-tongue.

07:56.442 --> 07:57.442
 A-tongue?

07:57.442 --> 07:58.442
 Anything.

07:58.442 --> 08:01.442
 I'll show you my favorite A-tongue.

08:02.256 --> 08:04.256
 You love me.

08:10.256 --> 08:11.256
 Love.

08:12.256 --> 08:13.256
 Cute.

08:15.256 --> 08:16.256
 Was it OK?

08:16.256 --> 08:17.256
 Yes!

08:17.256 --> 08:19.256
 Watch this.

08:21.664 --> 08:23.664
 I thought you were pulling my hair.

08:23.664 --> 08:25.664
 I was a little unfair.

08:25.664 --> 08:27.664
 I thought you were pulling my hair.

08:27.664 --> 08:37.946
 I thought you were pulling my hair.

08:37.946 --> 08:40.946
 to complete the

08:40.966 --> 08:43.026
 One face is concentrating on
concentrating frog

08:43.026 --> 08:49.986
 If you

08:53.226 --> 08:55.926
 say stop when I

08:55.926 --> 08:56.746
 can't

08:58.266 --> 09:01.546
 I think I'm

09:01.546 --> 09:02.546
 hungry

09:02.546 --> 09:03.232
 Thank you for watching.

09:03.232 --> 09:15.232
 I have a movie I want to see now.

09:15.232 --> 09:19.232
 What do you want to see?

09:19.232 --> 09:27.232
 I don't know if I'm doing it now, but I
wanted to see Saitama.

09:27.232 --> 09:32.232
 I want to see the movie.

09:33.416 --> 09:35.416
 You are intruding.

09:39.416 --> 09:40.416
 Talk.

09:41.416 --> 09:42.416
 I want to die.

09:42.416 --> 09:43.416

10:07.274 --> 10:09.274
 What should I do?

10:09.274 --> 10:11.274
 What should I do?

10:11.274 --> 10:13.274
 I don't know.

10:13.274 --> 10:15.274
 I don't know.

10:15.274 --> 10:28.858
 To be continued.

10:28.858 --> 10:33.858
 Yes, then it's a punishment game for
Hiyuri.

10:33.858 --> 10:37.858
 Hiyuri's second story

10:37.858 --> 10:39.858
 Yeah

10:39.858 --> 10:44.858
 I revealed Hiyuri's story in the last
double edition.

10:44.858 --> 10:47.858
 There was another one

10:47.858 --> 10:49.858

 I'm here

 Then my story please

10:55.858 --> 10:58.858
 Yes

11:07.674 --> 11:09.674
 How was it?

11:09.674 --> 11:11.674
 It was quite difficult.

11:11.674 --> 11:16.674
 I know the words I shouldn't say in the
NG word battle.

11:16.674 --> 11:19.674
 I knew I should use those words to
talk.

11:19.674 --> 11:22.674
 But this was a bit more difficult than
that.

11:22.674 --> 11:24.674
 It was difficult.

11:24.674 --> 11:27.674
 I made a weird face.

11:27.674 --> 11:30.674
 But I want to do this again.

11:30.674 --> 11:32.674
 It was fun.

11:32.674 --> 11:34.674
 It was fun.

11:34.674 --> 11:37.674
 Thank you for watching.

11:37.674 --> 11:39.674

 I'm holding Julia's finger.

12:33.318 --> 12:35.318
 Julia's pose.

12:35.318 --> 12:49.274
 Thank you for watching.

12:49.274 --> 12:51.274
 I'm Black Paburin.

12:51.274 --> 12:54.274
 I don't know how to end this.

12:54.274 --> 12:56.274
 I'm Black Paburin.

12:56.274 --> 12:57.274
 Bambi, help me.

12:57.274 --> 12:58.274
 No.

12:58.274 --> 13:02.274
 I'll eat Paburin.

13:02.274 --> 13:05.274
 Black...

13:08.274 --> 13:09.274
 I'm messed up.

13:09.274 --> 13:11.274
 I was beaten.

13:11.274 --> 13:13.274
 I became a bone.

13:13.274 --> 13:15.274
 I'm a bone.

13:15.274 --> 13:19.274
 I became a bone.

13:24.634 --> 13:28.634
 I can eat aannyyhing with it.

13:28.634 --> 13:30.634
 Bye!

13:32.456 --> 13:34.456
 What was it?

13:34.456 --> 13:36.456
 Do you get red bean paste with
anything?

13:36.456 --> 13:38.456
 Yeah, I think so.

13:38.456 --> 13:40.456
 Did you solve it?

13:40.456 --> 13:42.456
 I want to eat Jirian rice!

13:42.456 --> 13:44.456
 I want to eat it!

13:44.456 --> 13:45.456
 What should I do?

13:45.456 --> 13:47.456
 I'm waiting for Bambi.

13:47.456 --> 13:50.456
 Julia, what do you think I should do?

13:50.456 --> 13:53.456
 I think Bambi is better.

13:53.456 --> 14:00.456
 Do you want to eat Jirian rice?

14:08.986 --> 14:10.986
 This is my room.

14:10.986 --> 14:12.986
 What?

14:12.986 --> 14:15.986
 This is my living room, right?

14:15.986 --> 14:17.986
 Do you use your phone?

14:17.986 --> 14:19.986
 Can you introduce yourself?

14:19.986 --> 14:21.986
 Yeah, I do.

14:23.942 --> 14:25.942
 Let's go forward, high hopes!
