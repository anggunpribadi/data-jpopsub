00:00:00,260 --> 00:00:02,780
Belonchan

2
00:00:02,780 --> 00:00:05,780
Hello!

3
00:00:05,780 --> 00:00:08,780
We are CUB!

4
00:00:09,800 --> 00:00:14,800
It's been a while since we all got
together.

5
00:00:14,800 --> 00:00:21,800
Today, we are going to be our manager.

6
00:00:23,800 --> 00:00:25,800
It's going to be hard, so please don't.

7
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:27,800
Please go home.

8
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:33,800
If we are going to be our manager, we
have to do the interview.

9
00:00:33,800 --> 00:00:36,800
We have to do it.

10
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:39,800
We have to know a lot of things.

11
00:00:39,800 --> 00:00:43,800
So, we are going to have an interview.

12
00:00:43,800 --> 00:00:45,800
It's going to be fun.

13
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:49,800
9 vs 1 is too much pressure.

14
00:00:49,800 --> 00:00:52,800
We are going to have an interview at 1
or 2.

15
00:00:53,800 --> 00:00:55,800
It's like an audition.

16
00:00:55,800 --> 00:01:00,800
We are going to have a fun promotion.

17
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:03,800
What kind of people do you need?

18
00:01:03,800 --> 00:01:05,800
We have a lot of luggage.

19
00:01:05,800 --> 00:01:07,800
We need a strong person.

20
00:01:07,800 --> 00:01:09,800
We need a man.

21
00:01:10,800 --> 00:01:13,800
We are from Tohoku, so we need Miyagi.

22
00:01:14,800 --> 00:01:16,800
We don't know Miyagi.

23
00:01:17,800 --> 00:01:19,800
We need someone who has a strong heart.

24
00:01:20,800 --> 00:01:22,800
Someone who doesn't give up.

25
00:01:23,800 --> 00:01:25,800
We need someone who can make takoyaki.

26
00:01:25,800 --> 00:01:29,800
We need someone who can do catering.

27
00:01:30,800 --> 00:01:33,800
I don't know who is going to be our
manager.

28
00:01:34,800 --> 00:01:36,800
We are going to have an interview.

29
00:01:37,800 --> 00:01:39,800
We are going to find a manager.

30
00:01:39,800 --> 00:01:41,800
We are going to find a manager.

31
00:01:44,800 --> 00:01:46,800
Please come in.

32
00:01:46,800 --> 00:01:48,800
Thank you.

33
00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:51,800
Thank you.

34
00:01:51,800 --> 00:01:59,200
Please subscribe to our channel.

35
00:02:00,200 --> 00:02:02,200
Are you nervous?

36
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:06,200
This is normal.

37
00:02:08,200 --> 00:02:11,200
Please introduce yourself.

38
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:16,200
I'm Katsuya Hirano from UUUM.

39
00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:19,200
Thank you for watching.

40
00:02:20,376 --> 00:02:22,376
What is your motivation for applying?

41
00:02:23,376 --> 00:02:27,376
I'm from Sendai and I'm a YouTuber.

42
00:02:29,376 --> 00:02:34,376
I often watch your videos as an idol in
Sendai.

43
00:02:36,376 --> 00:02:40,376
I want to be a YouTuber and manage my
channel.

44
00:02:42,376 --> 00:02:43,376
Thank you.

45
00:02:44,376 --> 00:02:46,376
Do you really think so?

46
00:02:46,376 --> 00:02:48,376
I'm a YouTuber.

47
00:02:50,376 --> 00:02:52,376
What is your specialty?

48
00:02:53,376 --> 00:02:57,376
I said that men should be strong.

49
00:02:58,376 --> 00:02:59,376
I can raise my legs.

50
00:03:00,376 --> 00:03:02,376
I can raise my legs.

51
00:03:02,376 --> 00:03:05,376
Please subscribe to my channel.

52
00:03:08,424 --> 00:03:10,424
Can I ask you your strengths?

53
00:03:11,424 --> 00:03:12,424
My strengths are...

54
00:03:13,424 --> 00:03:14,424
I'm kind.

55
00:03:15,424 --> 00:03:16,424
You said it yourself.

56
00:03:17,424 --> 00:03:19,424
It's important to have a self-awareness.

57
00:03:20,424 --> 00:03:21,424
What are your weaknesses?

58
00:03:21,424 --> 00:03:22,424
I'm a loud mouth.

59
00:03:23,424 --> 00:03:24,424
I'm a loud mouth.

60
00:03:27,424 --> 00:03:28,424
I'm loud and smelly.

61
00:03:30,424 --> 00:03:31,424
I'm a minus.

62
00:03:32,424 --> 00:03:33,424
That's a little tough.

63
00:03:33,424 --> 00:03:36,424
I'm not good at being loud.

64
00:03:37,424 --> 00:03:38,424
I get angry.

65
00:03:40,424 --> 00:03:41,424
Are you good at complimenting?

66
00:03:42,424 --> 00:03:45,424
I'm not good at complimenting girls.

67
00:03:46,424 --> 00:03:47,424
That's a minus.

68
00:03:48,424 --> 00:03:49,424
I'm embarrassed.

69
00:03:50,424 --> 00:03:51,424
Please compliment me.

70
00:03:53,424 --> 00:03:54,424
You're cute.

71
00:03:56,424 --> 00:03:57,424
Your hair looks good on you.

72
00:03:58,424 --> 00:03:59,424
You have a big face.

73
00:03:59,424 --> 00:04:01,424
You have a grain of rice on your face.

74
00:04:03,424 --> 00:04:04,424
Your hair is smooth.

75
00:04:05,424 --> 00:04:06,424
I don't think I can do this.

76
00:04:11,424 --> 00:04:13,424
I've learned your name.

77
00:04:14,424 --> 00:04:15,424
You don't have to learn my name.

78
00:04:16,424 --> 00:04:17,424
I'm your manager.

79
00:04:18,424 --> 00:04:19,424
I have to learn your name.

80
00:04:20,424 --> 00:04:21,424
Date-san.

81
00:04:22,424 --> 00:04:23,424
Hinata-san.

82
00:04:26,424 --> 00:04:27,424
That's a minus.

83
00:04:27,424 --> 00:04:28,424
Thank you.

84
00:04:29,424 --> 00:04:30,424
I'm a good man.

85
00:04:34,424 --> 00:04:36,424
Can I choose a favorite from these?

86
00:04:37,424 --> 00:04:38,424
Soy sauce?

87
00:04:39,424 --> 00:04:40,424
I like salt.

88
00:04:43,424 --> 00:04:44,424
Who do you choose?

89
00:04:45,424 --> 00:04:46,424
Hinano-san.

90
00:04:48,424 --> 00:04:50,424
I don't know what she's talking about.

91
00:04:51,424 --> 00:04:52,424
I don't know what she's talking about.

92
00:04:53,424 --> 00:04:54,424
I like soy sauce.

93
00:04:54,424 --> 00:04:55,424
I like soy sauce.

94
00:04:56,424 --> 00:04:57,424
Can I have a joke?

95
00:04:58,424 --> 00:04:59,424
Sure.

96
00:04:59,424 --> 00:05:05,274
Thank you for watching this video.
Please subscribe to this channel.

97
00:05:05,274 --> 00:05:07,274
I think it's good.

98
00:05:07,274 --> 00:05:09,274
I like the impression.

99
00:05:09,274 --> 00:05:11,274
Is this good?

100
00:05:11,274 --> 00:05:13,274
It's not good.

101
00:05:13,274 --> 00:05:15,274
I can hear your voice.

102
00:05:15,274 --> 00:05:17,274
Manager's voice is not good.

103
00:05:19,274 --> 00:05:21,274
I think it's good.

104
00:05:23,274 --> 00:05:25,274
I think it's good.

105
00:05:25,274 --> 00:05:27,274
I think it's good.

106
00:05:27,274 --> 00:05:29,274
I think so.

107
00:05:29,274 --> 00:05:31,274
It's almost good.

108
00:05:31,274 --> 00:05:33,274
It's almost good.

109
00:05:33,274 --> 00:05:35,274
I can see your bear.

110
00:05:35,274 --> 00:05:37,274
It's not a bear.

111
00:05:37,274 --> 00:05:39,274
It's your eyes.

112
00:05:39,274 --> 00:05:41,274
It's a different character.

113
00:05:41,274 --> 00:05:43,274
It's your eyes.

114
00:05:43,274 --> 00:05:45,274
I was told that it's good.

115
00:05:45,274 --> 00:05:47,274
I feel good.

116
00:05:47,274 --> 00:05:49,274
It's good.

117
00:05:49,274 --> 00:05:51,274
It's almost good.

118
00:05:51,274 --> 00:05:53,274
I'll do my best.

119
00:05:53,274 --> 00:05:55,930
Please subscribe to my channel.

120
00:05:55,930 --> 00:06:02,930
Let's start the second census.

121
00:06:02,930 --> 00:06:04,930
Thank you.

122
00:06:08,930 --> 00:06:10,930
What is your personality like?

123
00:06:10,930 --> 00:06:12,930
My personality?

124
00:06:12,930 --> 00:06:14,930
I'm difficult to get along with.

125
00:06:19,930 --> 00:06:22,930
Please tell us about your positive
personality.

126
00:06:22,930 --> 00:06:26,930
I don't care about my personality.

127
00:06:29,952 --> 00:06:33,952
Oh, I see. Thank you.

128
00:06:33,952 --> 00:06:36,952
What do people around you call you?

129
00:06:36,952 --> 00:06:40,952
I don't know why, but they call me a
weirdo.

130
00:06:40,952 --> 00:06:42,952
I don't know why.

131
00:06:42,952 --> 00:06:45,952
I just live my life normally.

132
00:06:45,952 --> 00:06:47,952
They ask me if I'm kidding.

133
00:06:47,952 --> 00:06:50,952
They ask me if I'm kidding even when I'm
serious.

134
00:06:50,952 --> 00:06:54,952
I think you should ask what type of
person you like.

135
00:06:54,952 --> 00:06:56,952
Oh, what do I look like?

136
00:06:56,952 --> 00:06:59,952
Anything.

137
00:06:59,952 --> 00:07:01,952
What do you like?

138
00:07:01,952 --> 00:07:04,952
Someone who is fun to be with.

139
00:07:04,952 --> 00:07:05,952
And?

140
00:07:05,952 --> 00:07:07,952
Someone who is not quiet.

141
00:07:07,952 --> 00:07:08,952
Someone who is noisy.

142
00:07:08,952 --> 00:07:12,952
I think noisy is good.

143
00:07:12,952 --> 00:07:14,952
Someone who is a little bit annoying.

144
00:07:14,952 --> 00:07:17,952
I think I should be someone who is not
annoying.

145
00:07:17,952 --> 00:07:19,952
I'm curious.

146
00:07:19,952 --> 00:07:23,952
Do you have a girlfriend?

147
00:07:23,952 --> 00:07:25,680
What?

148
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:27,680
I'm saying this in the video, but I
don't have one.

149
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:29,680
Congratulations!

150
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:35,680
Do you have a girlfriend?

151
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:36,680
I don't have one.

152
00:07:36,680 --> 00:07:41,600
Thank you for watching! Please subscribe
to our channel!

153
00:07:42,600 --> 00:07:44,600
I want a lot of them.

154
00:07:44,600 --> 00:07:45,600
Thank you.

155
00:07:45,600 --> 00:07:47,600
I want a lot of them.

156
00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:48,600
I can't say it.

157
00:07:48,600 --> 00:07:53,600
By the way, can I ask you about your
annual income?

158
00:07:53,600 --> 00:07:55,600
If you get a P,

159
00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:58,600
I don't know how much I get.

160
00:07:58,600 --> 00:07:59,600
I don't know.

161
00:08:02,600 --> 00:08:03,600
I don't know.

162
00:08:03,600 --> 00:08:04,600
I don't know.

163
00:08:04,600 --> 00:08:05,600
I don't know.

164
00:08:09,096 --> 00:08:11,096
I feel awkward.

165
00:08:12,096 --> 00:08:14,096
I feel awkward, too.

166
00:08:15,096 --> 00:08:17,096
I feel awkward, too.

167
00:08:22,096 --> 00:08:24,096
But, I have many preferences.

168
00:08:25,096 --> 00:08:27,096
You have a dream.

169
00:08:28,096 --> 00:08:30,096
How about Takoyaki?

170
00:08:31,096 --> 00:08:33,096
I can make Takoyaki at home.

171
00:08:33,096 --> 00:08:35,096
I can't make Takoyaki at home.

172
00:08:36,096 --> 00:08:37,096
I see.

173
00:08:38,096 --> 00:08:40,096
By the way,

174
00:08:41,096 --> 00:08:45,096
Takoyaki and YouTubers are prohibited.

175
00:08:46,096 --> 00:08:49,096
I want you to quit YouTube.

176
00:08:50,096 --> 00:08:51,096
How do you decide?

177
00:08:52,096 --> 00:08:53,096
I quit YouTube.

178
00:08:54,096 --> 00:08:56,096
I'll be a manager.

179
00:08:57,096 --> 00:08:58,096
Is it a luxury?

180
00:08:59,096 --> 00:09:00,096
Yes.

181
00:09:00,096 --> 00:09:06,096
If you can work here, I'm happy.

182
00:09:07,096 --> 00:09:08,096
I think it's good.

183
00:09:09,096 --> 00:09:11,096
This is a video of the second screening.

184
00:09:11,096 --> 00:09:17,096
Thank you for watching this video.

185
00:09:18,920 --> 00:09:23,920
Now, we are going to do the final
screening.

186
00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:27,920
Thank you for your cooperation.

187
00:09:27,920 --> 00:09:29,920
The fifth question is,

188
00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:33,920
What do you want to be when you are
reborn?

189
00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:36,920
I want to be a cute girl when I am
reborn.

190
00:09:36,920 --> 00:09:38,920
Why is that?

191
00:09:38,920 --> 00:09:41,920
I thought school would be fun.

192
00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:42,920
I see.

193
00:09:42,920 --> 00:09:45,920
I think life from that point of view
would be fun.

194
00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:48,920
I think my life is good now.

195
00:09:48,920 --> 00:09:57,920
If you become an idol, what do you want
to be in charge of?

196
00:09:57,920 --> 00:10:00,920
I want to be in charge of pink.

197
00:10:00,920 --> 00:10:03,920
I see.

198
00:10:03,920 --> 00:10:07,920
I want to be in charge of pink and be a
cute girl.

199
00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:09,920
You mean Fushimi-chan?

200
00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:10,920
Yes.

201
00:10:10,920 --> 00:10:12,920
I see.

202
00:10:12,920 --> 00:10:14,920
I want to be like Fushimi-chan.

203
00:10:14,920 --> 00:10:16,920
I want to be like her.

204
00:10:16,920 --> 00:10:18,920
You are white.

205
00:10:18,920 --> 00:10:21,920
You can be white and white.

206
00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:23,920
I see.

207
00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:25,920
Thank you.

208
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:28,920
I have a question.

209
00:10:28,920 --> 00:10:32,920
YUNA is 20 years old.

210
00:10:32,920 --> 00:10:35,920
She invites you to drink.

211
00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:38,920
But you have an important job tomorrow.

212
00:10:38,920 --> 00:10:40,920
What do you say?

213
00:10:40,920 --> 00:10:41,920
It's difficult.

214
00:10:41,920 --> 00:10:44,920
You have to realize the relationship.

215
00:10:44,920 --> 00:10:48,920
I have been doing my important job.

216
00:10:48,920 --> 00:10:50,920
That's why I'm still drinking.

217
00:10:50,920 --> 00:10:53,920
So, let's go drinking.

218
00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:56,920
Are you going to go drinking?

219
00:10:56,920 --> 00:10:57,920
I think it's good.

220
00:10:57,920 --> 00:10:59,920
I think it's good.

221
00:10:59,920 --> 00:11:01,920
I think it's good.

222
00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:03,920
I think it's good.

223
00:11:03,920 --> 00:11:06,920
I think it's good that she goes drinking
no matter what happens tomorrow.

224
00:11:06,920 --> 00:11:08,920
She drinks and does her next job.

225
00:11:08,920 --> 00:11:10,920
I think so.

226
00:11:10,920 --> 00:11:11,920
I think so.

227
00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:12,920
I think so.

228
00:11:12,920 --> 00:11:13,920
I think it's good.

229
00:11:13,920 --> 00:11:14,920
I think it's good.

230
00:11:14,920 --> 00:11:15,920
I think it's good.

231
00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:18,920
I'm not going to drink.

232
00:11:18,920 --> 00:11:24,920
On the day of the important live, Katsu-
san was late.

233
00:11:24,920 --> 00:11:27,920
What do you say?

234
00:11:27,920 --> 00:11:30,920
I brought 100 Gari-Gari-kun.

235
00:11:30,920 --> 00:11:34,920
I said I saved the convenience store.

236
00:11:34,920 --> 00:11:39,920
I wanted to give it to everyone, so I
sent it.

237
00:11:39,920 --> 00:11:41,920
I see.

238
00:11:41,920 --> 00:11:44,920
You bought 100 Gari-Gari-kun.

239
00:11:44,920 --> 00:11:47,920
Yes, I bought them at the convenience
store.

240
00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:49,920
Is that a sign of apology?

241
00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:50,920
Yes, it is.

242
00:11:50,920 --> 00:11:51,920
You bought them.

243
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:53,920
I bought them with my whole fortune.

244
00:11:53,920 --> 00:11:55,920
You didn't buy them with your money.

245
00:11:55,920 --> 00:11:57,920
I don't have 100 Gari-Gari-kun.

246
00:11:57,920 --> 00:11:59,920
I have 100 Gari-Gari-kun.

247
00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:01,920
Did you buy them at the store?

248
00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:03,920
I don't know.

249
00:12:03,920 --> 00:12:05,920
I don't know.

250
00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:07,920
I thought I might have a chance to buy
them.

251
00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:11,920
I thought it would be difficult to sell
them if I bought them at the store.

252
00:12:11,920 --> 00:12:14,920
You're going to bring a sign of apology.

253
00:12:14,920 --> 00:12:16,920
That's important.

254
00:12:16,920 --> 00:12:18,920
I'm going to tell you to come as soon as
possible.

255
00:12:18,920 --> 00:12:20,920
I agree.

256
00:12:20,920 --> 00:12:23,920
I'll take your feelings.

257
00:12:23,920 --> 00:12:25,920
I think it's important to show your
feelings in a form.

258
00:12:25,920 --> 00:12:28,920
I see.

259
00:12:28,920 --> 00:12:33,920
One member didn't come to the important
live.

260
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:41,920
But, you'll be there 30 minutes after
the live starts.

261
00:12:41,920 --> 00:12:46,920
How do you fill the gap of one member?

262
00:12:46,920 --> 00:12:47,920
I'll be there.

263
00:12:47,920 --> 00:12:49,920
I'll say hello.

264
00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:53,920
Do you have the courage to come out if
you're going to be there?

265
00:12:53,920 --> 00:12:56,920
I'll be there if I'm there.

266
00:12:56,920 --> 00:12:58,920
Can you dance?

267
00:12:58,920 --> 00:13:02,920
I think improvisation is important for
idol.

268
00:13:02,920 --> 00:13:04,920
Can you dance?

269
00:13:04,920 --> 00:13:06,920
How do I do it?

270
00:13:11,920 --> 00:13:13,920
It's good.

271
00:13:13,920 --> 00:13:15,920
You're good at improvising.

272
00:13:18,920 --> 00:13:20,920
You're good at arranging.

273
00:13:20,920 --> 00:13:29,920
Can you introduce yourself to the
audience?

274
00:13:29,920 --> 00:13:33,920
Hello.

275
00:13:33,920 --> 00:13:37,920
I'm a YouTuber who came from FUWAFUWA.

276
00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:39,920
I'm Katsuya.

277
00:13:41,920 --> 00:13:44,920
I'm a crazy guy who came from KURUKURU.

278
00:13:44,920 --> 00:13:46,920
I'm Katsuya Hirano.

279
00:13:46,920 --> 00:13:50,920
I'm Katsuya Hirano.

280
00:13:50,920 --> 00:13:52,920
You're good.

281
00:13:52,920 --> 00:13:57,920
You've got a good personality.

282
00:13:57,920 --> 00:14:02,920
What do you think is important when
you're a manager?

283
00:14:02,920 --> 00:14:07,920
I think it's important to protect time.

284
00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:11,920
I think it's important to be
considerate.

285
00:14:11,920 --> 00:14:18,920
If you pass the audition, you'll be the
manager of TOHOKU.

286
00:14:18,920 --> 00:14:23,920
How do you want to produce TOHOKU?

287
00:14:23,920 --> 00:14:30,920
I think you can change your policy when
you can do anything.

288
00:14:30,920 --> 00:14:41,920
I want to make a channel that can target
all countries while leaving the color of
TOHOKU.

289
00:14:41,920 --> 00:14:44,920
I want you to do it.

290
00:14:44,920 --> 00:14:48,920
I feel like I'm a very talented manager.

291
00:14:48,920 --> 00:14:54,920
Lastly, please appeal to the camera.

292
00:14:54,920 --> 00:14:57,920
Thank you.

293
00:14:57,920 --> 00:15:17,690
Please subscribe to our channel.

294
00:15:17,690 --> 00:15:24,690
I will announce the results based on the
selection of judges.

295
00:15:24,690 --> 00:15:35,642
Katsu-san is the manager of the In Night
Talk.

296
00:15:35,642 --> 00:15:37,642
Congratulations!

297
00:15:37,642 --> 00:15:39,642
Yes!

298
00:15:39,642 --> 00:15:41,642
Yes!

299
00:15:41,642 --> 00:15:43,642
I did it!

300
00:15:43,642 --> 00:15:45,642
Now, I can be a member of Ikezaki Talk!

301
00:15:45,642 --> 00:15:47,642
Wow!

302
00:15:47,642 --> 00:15:49,642
I'm so grateful.

303
00:15:49,642 --> 00:15:51,642
Thank you for your cooperation.

304
00:15:53,642 --> 00:15:55,642
Hey!

305
00:15:55,642 --> 00:15:57,642
I'm a member of Ikezaki Talk!

306
00:15:57,642 --> 00:15:58,912
Yay!

307
00:15:59,912 --> 00:16:03,912
So, we collaborated with Katsu this
time!

308
00:16:03,912 --> 00:16:05,912
Thank you so much!

309
00:16:05,912 --> 00:16:08,912
Thank you so much, Hondo-kun!

310
00:16:08,912 --> 00:16:10,912
I'm acting like a kid.

311
00:16:11,912 --> 00:16:15,912
There aren't many idols who are active
in Sendai.

312
00:16:15,912 --> 00:16:16,912
I'm a little...

313
00:16:16,912 --> 00:16:18,912
I got it.

314
00:16:19,912 --> 00:16:21,912
I thought there were a lot of younger
sisters.

315
00:16:21,912 --> 00:16:23,912
I felt like I was talking to my sister.

316
00:16:23,912 --> 00:16:25,912
That's great.

317
00:16:25,912 --> 00:16:28,912
I'm talking to an interesting brother.

318
00:16:28,912 --> 00:16:29,912
I see.

319
00:16:30,912 --> 00:16:31,912
That's great.

320
00:16:31,912 --> 00:16:32,912
Thank you so much.

321
00:16:32,912 --> 00:16:34,912
Can I say something?

322
00:16:34,912 --> 00:16:36,912
I'm a leader.

323
00:16:36,912 --> 00:16:38,912
I've been thinking about it a lot.

324
00:16:38,912 --> 00:16:41,912
Everyone is betting their lives on Talk!

325
00:16:41,912 --> 00:16:43,912
I don't know what to say.

326
00:16:43,912 --> 00:16:50,912
If there's someone who thinks of us as
younger sisters,

327
00:16:50,912 --> 00:16:54,912
I thought I might be anxious about the
future.

328
00:16:54,912 --> 00:16:56,912
What do you think?

329
00:16:56,912 --> 00:16:59,912
I'm going to blow a new wind.

330
00:16:59,912 --> 00:17:00,912
I see.

331
00:17:00,912 --> 00:17:04,912
The leader will announce the results.

332
00:17:04,912 --> 00:17:11,168
Thank you for your kind judgment.

333
00:17:12,168 --> 00:17:14,168
I'm going to choose Yu-go-kan.

334
00:17:15,168 --> 00:17:17,168
What should I say?

335
00:17:19,168 --> 00:17:21,168
I think she is a good person.

336
00:17:22,168 --> 00:17:27,168
I hope you can get along with her.

337
00:17:28,168 --> 00:17:30,168
I'm not imitating you.

338
00:17:30,168 --> 00:17:34,168
I'm happy to collaborate with you.

339
00:17:35,168 --> 00:17:36,168
I'm not imitating you.

340
00:17:36,168 --> 00:17:39,168
I'm not imitating you.

341
00:17:41,688 --> 00:17:43,688
Thank you!

342
00:17:46,688 --> 00:17:48,688
Please continue to support us!

343
00:17:49,688 --> 00:17:51,688
This was Tomoko Ikinari. Thank you!

344
00:17:52,688 --> 00:17:54,688
Thank you!

345
00:17:54,688 --> 00:18:10,688
