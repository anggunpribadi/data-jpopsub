[Takoyaki] A big YouTuber came for a manager interview! ? [Iginari Tohoku product]

I suddenly wanted to be a manager from Tohoku,
That big YouTuber came for an interview!

If you want to be our manager, we will interview you! !
So this time the members themselves,
We will have a manager interview with a big YouTuber!

The moment the new manager is born! ?
