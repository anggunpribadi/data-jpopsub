1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
The title is...

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Kanto Idol!

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:09,000
Can you please give us a cute title
call?

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:10,000
Yes!

5
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:14,000
My three main elements!

6
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:24,000
Can you show us the three elements you
wrote down in advance?

7
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:25,000
Yes!

8
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:26,000
Ta-da!

9
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,000
This is it!

10
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,000
I see.

11
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:37,000
The third element is sauna!

12
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:39,000
Oh!

13
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:43,000
You're really into sauna!

14
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:52,000
Actually, my father has been in the
sauna for almost 20 years.

15
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
That's amazing!

16
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:58,000
My father used to love family so much.

17
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:03,000
He used to go to the sauna with his
family.

18
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:09,000
But he never said he'd go to the sauna
with his family.

19
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:10,000
That's true.

20
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:13,000
And idols are like...

21
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:16,000
What do you call it?

22
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:20,000
They're like a water-related thing.

23
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
They don't say it out loud.

24
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
I see.

25
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:27,000
I think that's what they're like.

26
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:31,000
But recently, the sauna boom has been
going on.

27
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:35,000
I'm glad to hear that.

28
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,000
So I'm going to try to get some
information.

29
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Oh!

30
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:43,000
What kind of information do you get from
the sauna?

31
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:45,000
I want to know more about it.

32
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:49,000
I go into the sauna first.

33
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:52,000
I see.

34
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:56,000
There are many places with salt in the
sauna.

35
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:00,000
I go into the salt sauna first.

36
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:04,000
Then I feel like my pores are opening.

37
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:09,000
So I sweat faster than I do in the
sauna.

38
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,000
How long do you go in?

39
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:14,000
I usually go in for 12 minutes.

40
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
Oh, 12 minutes!

41
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:20,000
I go in for 12 minutes and then go in
for 10 minutes.

42
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:25,000
Then I go in for a bath.

43
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,000
I see.

44
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:32,000
I think everyone wants to know about
this.

45
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:36,000
Sauna is only for women.

46
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:39,000
So it's a bit of a shame.

47
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,000
That's true.

48
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,000
It's not a strange thing.

49
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:46,000
I may be asking in a strange way.

50
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:50,000
I imagine it.

51
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:53,000
I like the sauna.

52
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,000
It's the best.

53
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:58,000
I can't live without a sauna.

54
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
That's it.

55
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:03,000
How often do you go in?

56
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:07,000
Not once a month, but once a week.

57
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,000
It depends on the day.

58
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,000
I go in 4 times a week when it's too
much.

59
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,000
4 times a week?

60
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,000
I go in once a week.

61
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:19,000
That's true.

62
