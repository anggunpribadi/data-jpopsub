1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
I'm a high-class idol.

2
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,000
And the third one is?

3
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:17,000
The third one is the character.

4
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:23,000
I like to write.

5
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:27,000
Not a letter, but a pen.

6
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:30,000
I haven't heard of a pen and a pen for a
long time.

7
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:38,000
I can write a strange letter.

8
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
What is it?

9
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:46,000
Recently, there are some things that are
reversed in the live broadcast.

10
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:53,000
When I made an announcement, I was told
that it was reversed.

11
00:00:53,000 --> 00:01:02,000
I thought about what to do, and I
thought I should write all the letters
in reverse.

12
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:05,000
I wrote it so that I could write the
letters in reverse.

13
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:07,000
Can you write the letters in reverse
right away?

14
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,000
I can write it.

15
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,000
I want you to write something.

16
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:13,000
Then I'll ask you to write the title.

17
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:17,000
Nightclub and idol.

18
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:19,000
Please write it.

19
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:22,000
Will it be in the live broadcast?

20
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
Let's go.

21
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:31,000
Nightclub and idol in reverse.

22
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:37,000
I'm impressed by your ability.

23
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:41,000
I'm impressed.

24
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Is there an idol-like letter when you
make an announcement?

25
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,000
I can write it.

26
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,000
It's a cute letter.

27
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:57,000
What did you write?

28
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:01,000
Please write an idol-like clip.

29
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:08,000
Please follow Takaichi Hoshikan SNS.

30
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:13,000
You always write your name too big.

31
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:19,000
I write it with a lot of momentum.

32
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,000
It's cute.

33
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,000
You like writing letters.

34
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:29,000
I want you to write something like that.

35
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:35,000
I'm in the industry, so I can write a
lot of questions.

36
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:40,000
I'm waiting for your question.

37
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:45,000
I wrote three letters.

38
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:50,000
I'll take a break before the end.

39
00:02:54,000 --> 00:03:00,000
It's a big challenge for me.

40
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:03,000
I want you to make sure you don't miss
this time.

41
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:10,000
I want you to make sure you don't miss
anything.
