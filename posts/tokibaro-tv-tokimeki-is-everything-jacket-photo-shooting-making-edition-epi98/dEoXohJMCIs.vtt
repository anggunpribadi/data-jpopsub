 You are a little faster than me

01:47.930 --> 01:52.930
 I'm waiting with my earphones

01:52.930 --> 02:00.930
 If you get closer from behind and tap
my back

02:02.248 --> 02:06.248
 I'm a little surprised and you laugh

02:06.248 --> 02:10.248
 I'm attracted to you, who is kind

02:11.248 --> 02:19.248
 Hey, I want to bully you somehow

02:19.248 --> 02:20.058
 I'm attracted to you, who is kind

02:20.058 --> 02:23.558
 I want you to look at me.

02:23.558 --> 02:28.558
 I'm sorry for being selfish.

02:28.558 --> 02:32.558
 It's your fault.

02:32.558 --> 02:37.558
 I'll be more cute tomorrow.

03:18.498 --> 03:24.498
 I'm a birdie of the forest

03:24.498 --> 03:28.498
 Today, we are shooting the album cover

03:28.498 --> 03:33.050
 It's a new outfit

03:33.050 --> 03:35.050
 Oh, it's cute!

03:37.050 --> 03:39.050
 This is the only one in the world.

03:40.050 --> 03:42.050
 Ishio-san drew it for me.

03:44.050 --> 03:46.050
 It's so cute.

03:48.050 --> 03:50.050
 The sleeves are different for each
person.

03:50.050 --> 03:56.050
 It's so cute.

03:56.050 --> 04:01.936
 We have a photo book today, so we're
taking photos.

04:02.936 --> 04:05.936
 It's so fun. We're holding flowers and
taking photos.

04:05.936 --> 04:07.936
 It's a cute shop.

04:22.682 --> 04:24.176
 Yes.

04:24.176 --> 04:28.176
 I finally finished my new outfit!

04:29.176 --> 04:32.176
 This is my first time wearing a
swimsuit.

 Is this rose?

04:39.176 --> 04:41.176
 Yes, it is.

04:41.176 --> 04:42.176
 This is also rose.

04:42.176 --> 04:43.176
 This is also rose.

04:43.176 --> 04:44.176
 Really?

04:44.176 --> 04:45.176
 And there is a tulip.

04:45.176 --> 04:47.176
 A green tulip.

04:47.176 --> 04:53.176
 I'm so excited!

05:09.402 --> 05:11.402
 A new category!

05:11.402 --> 05:13.562
 Noway...

05:13.562 --> 05:17.562
 Plus, skateboarding in the city itself

05:17.562 --> 05:19.562
 I ate it all.

05:27.258 --> 05:28.258

05:59.482 --> 06:03.242
 Hey yo yo yo yo MC Kanami Aki

06:05.136 --> 06:07.136

06:07.136 --> 06:09.136
 I'm embarrassed.

06:11.136 --> 06:13.136
 I'm embarrassed.

06:15.136 --> 06:17.136
 Thank you, Julia.

06:18.136 --> 06:20.136
 I'm so happy.

06:20.136 --> 06:22.136
 Fairy, fairy.

06:22.136 --> 06:31.136
 Oh, fairy.

06:52.136 --> 06:54.136
 Let's find your favorite juice.

06:54.136 --> 06:57.136
 I'll sit next to you.

06:57.136 --> 07:00.136
 Until the sun goes down,

07:00.136 --> 07:03.136
 Every time the wind blows,

07:03.136 --> 07:06.136
 The scent of love is floating.

07:06.136 --> 07:09.136
 I've talked a lot.

07:09.136 --> 07:12.136
 My hair is getting longer.

07:12.136 --> 07:17.136
 Do you want to go home soon?

07:17.136 --> 07:19.136
 I love you.

07:19.136 --> 07:22.136
 I've been trying so hard to say this.

07:22.136 --> 07:25.136
 Stay a little longer.

07:25.136 --> 07:27.136
 I love you.

07:27.136 --> 07:29.274
 I love you.

07:29.274 --> 07:33.274
 I'm happy just to be here.

07:33.274 --> 07:36.274
 I'm happy just to be here.

07:36.378 --> 07:39.358
 Thanks for coming to the show!

07:49.318 --> 07:51.198
 Do what you want with the heroine.

07:52.118 --> 07:53.198
 Today,

07:53.878 --> 08:00.898
 we are shooting some photos for my new
album.

08:01.058 --> 08:02.678
 There!

08:02.718 --> 08:08.038
 This was done with a really cute
costume

08:08.038 --> 08:11.298
 and her hair is also really cute

08:11.338 --> 08:15.878
 Passion Max was done!

08:17.558 --> 08:20.158
 I went check?

08:20.158 --> 08:23.678
 I could see the videos I started
taking.

08:26.632 --> 08:29.632
 Look! I'm doing the same pose again.

08:30.632 --> 08:32.632
 I'm wearing a coat with the same pose.

08:34.632 --> 08:35.632
 Cute!

08:36.632 --> 08:38.632
 There are still many more.

08:42.632 --> 08:43.632
 What?

08:43.632 --> 08:44.632
 I'm so happy!

08:44.632 --> 08:47.632
 I'm happy because everyone is flying.

08:50.266 --> 08:53.466
 But even if it's just one day, it's the
worst

08:53.466 --> 08:56.366
 Even if it's just one day, thank you
for your hard work

08:56.366 --> 09:00.166
 Tomorrow will surely be a better day

09:00.166 --> 09:02.966
 Falling in love with fate

09:02.966 --> 09:05.766
 Fulfilling long-standing dreams

09:05.766 --> 09:07.966
 No matter what it is, it's like a
competition

09:07.966 --> 09:09.766
 Although there is no basis

09:09.766 --> 09:10.966
 No doubt!

09:10.966 --> 09:15.866
 Experience, truth, and power

09:15.866 --> 09:20.166
 I want to live like a newbie

09:20.496 --> 09:22.496
 Hello!

09:22.496 --> 09:24.496
 Let's watch it together!

09:24.496 --> 09:26.496
 The strongest daily coffee!

09:26.496 --> 09:28.496
 Let's go! Tomorrow Tomorrow Tomorrow!

09:48.496 --> 09:49.496
 I'm so happy!

09:51.368 --> 09:53.368
 What do you think?

09:53.368 --> 09:55.368
 I think roses are the best.

09:55.368 --> 09:57.368
 I think so, too.

09:57.368 --> 10:00.368
 I don't think green roses are very
attractive.

10:02.328 --> 10:08.328
 I want to be a person who is beautiful
like a rose.

10:10.328 --> 10:13.328
 I'm going to use a lot of flowers in
today's jacket photoshoot.

10:14.328 --> 10:20.328
 I just thought about it, but I'm going
to put a bunch of flowers around me.

10:21.328 --> 10:22.328
 Bye bye.

10:22.328 --> 10:28.328
 I'm going to put a bunch of flowers
around me.

10:31.834 --> 10:41.834
 We will definitely make the future
brighter with everyone, so let's keep
running up any wall together!

11:03.424 --> 11:05.424
 I'll live on

11:05.424 --> 11:07.424
 Next, the strongest update!

11:07.424 --> 11:09.424
 Useless, useless, useless, low

11:09.424 --> 11:10.424
 The strongest set

11:10.424 --> 11:13.424
 To my new self, hello, hello

11:13.424 --> 11:15.424
 I don't care what they say

11:15.424 --> 11:18.424
 I'll attack them without hesitation

11:18.424 --> 11:25.424
 Because I've fallen in love with you

11:25.424 --> 11:26.424
 Let's go!

11:26.424 --> 11:31.424
 My feelings for you will soon turn into
love

11:31.424 --> 11:35.424
 It's beautiful, it's sparkling

11:35.424 --> 11:37.424
 Thank you, for the days I was shy

11:37.424 --> 11:40.424
 I can't believe I've dreamed of it

11:40.424 --> 11:45.424
 From now on, it'll surely be an endless

11:45.424 --> 11:47.424
 I won't forget, I can't forget

11:47.424 --> 11:50.424
 I'm happy just from those moments

11:50.424 --> 11:55.424
 I'll cry, I'll laugh

11:59.866 --> 12:03.526
 End of chapter one.

12:51.898 --> 12:59.898
 After a fight, I always buy two ice
creams

13:00.154 --> 13:04.474
 You're a kind bird that laughs and
says,

13:04.474 --> 13:09.434
 I'm sorry.

13:09.434 --> 13:17.354
 Hey, I want you to stay dry forever.

13:17.354 --> 13:21.994
 I want to be your type of girl.

13:21.994 --> 13:26.874
 I'm sorry for bothering you.

13:26.874 --> 13:27.226
 I'm sorry.

13:27.226 --> 13:30.726
 My heart is pounding because of you

13:30.726 --> 13:35.726
 Let's have more fun tomorrow

13:35.726 --> 13:39.726
 I'll always draw you

13:39.726 --> 13:43.726
 My precious feelings

13:44.726 --> 13:48.226
 Sometimes, I'll be by your side

13:48.226 --> 13:53.226
 And I'll be flippant

13:53.226 --> 13:57.754
 I'll always think about you

13:57.754 --> 14:01.754
 Because I have it

14:01.754 --> 14:16.754
 Thank you for watching!

14:21.658 --> 14:24.658
 I'm always lonely

14:24.658 --> 14:29.658
 You are the source of my energy

14:29.658 --> 14:34.658
 Please stay by my side from now on

14:36.658 --> 14:40.658
 My heart is pounding because of you

14:40.658 --> 14:45.658
 I'm glad I could meet you again

14:45.658 --> 14:46.490
 I'm glad I could meet you again

14:46.490 --> 14:53.490
 I'm happy in the world, only you

14:53.490 --> 14:57.490
 Sometimes it's your fault

14:57.490 --> 15:02.490
 Because tomorrow will be more cute

15:02.490 --> 15:10.490
 Always, always, I hope I can be next to
you
