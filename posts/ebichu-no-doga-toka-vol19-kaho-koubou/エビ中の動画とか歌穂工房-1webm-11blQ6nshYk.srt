1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Like a video of shrimp.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Kaho Kobayashi's video.

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,000
Hello. I'm Kaho Kobayashi, the number
11.

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:17,000
I'm not the only one who is going to do
today.

5
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,000
Today, I'm going to do a Kaho Kobayashi.

6
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:27,000
Here are many blocks.

7
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:28,400
Today...

8
00:00:29,400 --> 00:00:33,400
I like to make crafts and draw pictures.

9
00:00:34,400 --> 00:00:37,400
I want to try it.

10
00:00:37,400 --> 00:00:40,400
I will make it now.

11
00:00:41,400 --> 00:00:45,400
I will make the first one.

12
00:00:45,400 --> 00:00:52,400
I will make it from the beginning.

13
00:00:52,400 --> 00:00:58,304
But I will make many blocks.

14
00:00:59,304 --> 00:01:03,304
I have many small parts.

15
00:01:03,304 --> 00:01:05,304
What should I do?

16
00:01:05,304 --> 00:01:12,304
I don't know if I can make it as I
imagine.

17
00:01:13,304 --> 00:01:20,304
I have never seen this kind of blocks.

18
00:01:20,304 --> 00:01:22,304
How can I use this?

19
00:01:22,304 --> 00:01:25,304
I don't know how to use this.

20
00:01:25,754 --> 00:01:29,754
I should start with this one.

21
00:01:29,754 --> 00:01:31,754
I should use this one.

22
00:01:31,754 --> 00:01:33,754
Wait a minute.

23
00:01:34,754 --> 00:01:37,754
I want to make it higher.

24
00:01:37,754 --> 00:01:39,754
What is this?

25
00:01:42,754 --> 00:01:43,754
I should use this one.

26
00:01:43,754 --> 00:01:45,754
I got it.

27
00:01:45,754 --> 00:01:47,754
Is this really going to work?

28
00:01:47,754 --> 00:01:51,754
We have time to do something at the end.

29
00:01:52,856 --> 00:01:55,856
I don't know if you can see it, but it
looks like this.

30
00:01:55,856 --> 00:01:58,856
This should be a little more shape.

31
00:01:58,856 --> 00:02:03,856
If you know this, you'll get a bonus.

32
00:02:03,856 --> 00:02:06,856
I should use this.

33
00:02:06,856 --> 00:02:08,856
I just took a picture of red.

34
00:02:08,856 --> 00:02:15,856
I'd like to put a white block in it.

35
00:02:15,856 --> 00:02:18,856
But it doesn't fit at all because it
doesn't fit.

36
00:02:18,856 --> 00:02:20,944
I can't put it in.

37
00:02:21,944 --> 00:02:25,944
I'll put it in and close the lid.

38
00:02:30,944 --> 00:02:31,944
Did you get it?

39
00:02:32,944 --> 00:02:33,944
I think you got it.

40
00:02:34,944 --> 00:02:37,944
There is a white part in the red.

41
00:02:38,944 --> 00:02:39,944
I'm sure you know this.

42
00:02:39,944 --> 00:02:42,944
I'm sure you know this.

43
00:02:43,824 --> 00:02:50,124
I'm into eating this right now.

44
00:02:50,124 --> 00:02:52,924
Can you see this?

45
00:02:52,924 --> 00:02:55,924
It's quite big.

46
00:02:55,924 --> 00:03:01,924
It's not easy to eat this alone.

47
00:03:01,924 --> 00:03:04,924
I'm into eating this.

48
00:03:04,924 --> 00:03:09,424
I'm almost there.

49
00:03:09,424 --> 00:03:12,424
I'm almost there.

50
00:03:12,424 --> 00:03:13,424
I'm almost there.

51
00:03:14,356 --> 00:03:17,856
The last time I did it was a long time
ago.

52
00:03:17,856 --> 00:03:22,856
I did it when I was in kindergarten or
elementary school.

53
00:03:22,856 --> 00:03:24,856
I did it when I was in the lower grades.

54
00:03:24,856 --> 00:03:27,856
I haven't done it since then.

55
00:03:27,856 --> 00:03:32,856
I didn't know there were so many parts.

56
00:03:35,856 --> 00:03:36,856
Can you understand me?

57
00:03:36,856 --> 00:03:39,856
I'm a little confused.

58
00:03:39,856 --> 00:03:42,856
I hope I can convey what I want to say.

59
00:03:43,808 --> 00:03:45,628
This one...

60
00:03:45,628 --> 00:03:48,168
I wasn't so sure if I could make it if I
had the whiteies.

61
00:03:48,168 --> 00:03:50,088
Maybe I was too greedy.

62
00:03:50,088 --> 00:03:51,148
This is the last one.

63
00:03:51,148 --> 00:03:53,148
Thank you for watching.

64
00:03:56,506 --> 00:03:58,506
I did it!

65
00:03:58,506 --> 00:04:00,506
I did it!

66
00:04:00,506 --> 00:04:02,506
I did it!

67
00:04:02,506 --> 00:04:04,506
I did it!

68
00:04:04,506 --> 00:04:06,506
Can you see it?

69
00:04:10,506 --> 00:04:12,506
Can you see it?

70
00:04:12,506 --> 00:04:14,506
It looks like this.

71
00:04:14,506 --> 00:04:16,506
It looks like this.

72
00:04:16,506 --> 00:04:18,506
I did it!

73
00:04:18,506 --> 00:04:20,506
Well,

74
00:04:20,506 --> 00:04:21,248
the second one is

75
00:04:21,248 --> 00:04:23,248
I'm going to make it!

76
00:04:23,248 --> 00:04:25,248
Ah, I see.

77
00:04:25,248 --> 00:04:27,248
It's amazing.

78
00:04:30,248 --> 00:04:32,248
Is it cool?

79
00:04:32,248 --> 00:04:42,128
I have a lot of parts, so I'd like to
use them.

80
00:04:43,128 --> 00:04:45,128
I'll put it on the window...

81
00:04:45,128 --> 00:04:49,128
I don't know which part to put this on.

82
00:04:49,128 --> 00:04:52,128
I wonder if they know.

83
00:04:56,128 --> 00:04:57,128
I found it.

84
00:04:57,128 --> 00:04:59,128
Maybe this is it.

85
00:04:59,128 --> 00:05:00,128
Ta-da!

86
00:05:00,128 --> 00:05:03,128
This looks like a YouTuber.

87
00:05:03,128 --> 00:05:05,128
This. I found it.

88
00:05:05,128 --> 00:05:08,128
This is it.

89
00:05:08,128 --> 00:05:10,128
Like this.

90
00:05:11,728 --> 00:05:13,728
With this.

91
00:05:15,304 --> 00:05:16,304
Wow!

92
00:05:16,304 --> 00:05:19,304
I think I can tell what it is by making
this.

93
00:05:19,304 --> 00:05:25,304
I think the pen tip is a little clumsy.

94
00:05:25,304 --> 00:05:27,304
What do you think?

95
00:05:27,304 --> 00:05:31,304
I like to do handicrafts and draw.

96
00:05:31,304 --> 00:05:33,304
So I think I'm good at it.

97
00:05:33,304 --> 00:05:39,304
But I don't remember much about LEGO.

98
00:05:39,304 --> 00:05:41,304
What was it?

99
00:05:41,304 --> 00:05:46,304
My grades in art school were all 5.

100
00:05:46,304 --> 00:05:49,304
I got a small grade.

101
00:05:49,304 --> 00:05:54,304
I was good at art and drawing.

102
00:06:02,010 --> 00:06:04,010
Is it really transparent?

103
00:06:07,010 --> 00:06:09,010
So far, it looks like this.

104
00:06:14,010 --> 00:06:16,010
This is a hint.

105
00:06:20,010 --> 00:06:22,010
Is it enough?

106
00:06:22,010 --> 00:06:24,010
I'll cut it.

107
00:06:24,010 --> 00:06:30,010
I'll cut it.

108
00:06:30,938 --> 00:06:32,938
The transparent one.

109
00:06:34,938 --> 00:06:35,938
What?

110
00:06:36,938 --> 00:06:38,938
I didn't know about the transparent one.

111
00:06:38,938 --> 00:06:52,938
It seems difficult to explain.

112
00:06:53,594 --> 00:06:55,594
I found a good one.

113
00:06:55,594 --> 00:06:57,594
This one is good.

114
00:07:01,594 --> 00:07:03,594
I'll look for this one.

115
00:07:05,594 --> 00:07:07,594
I'm looking for this part.

116
00:07:09,594 --> 00:07:11,594
I wonder if there is this part.

117
00:07:11,594 --> 00:07:17,594
I found this one.

118
00:07:17,594 --> 00:07:28,410
I'm looking for this part.

119
00:07:28,410 --> 00:07:30,410
I did it!

120
00:07:31,410 --> 00:07:33,410
It's like this.

121
00:07:38,410 --> 00:07:41,410
But this is not just a voice.

122
00:07:41,410 --> 00:07:48,224
Do you understand?

123
00:07:49,224 --> 00:07:50,224
The point is...

124
00:07:52,224 --> 00:07:53,224
When you look at it like this...

125
00:07:54,224 --> 00:07:55,224
How should I say it?

126
00:07:55,224 --> 00:07:57,224
Like this?

127
00:07:58,672 --> 00:08:05,672
I practiced including these parts.

128
00:08:05,672 --> 00:08:16,672
I wanted to use this fashionable
transparent block, so I used it.

129
00:08:16,672 --> 00:08:19,672
The second one is done!

130
00:08:22,644 --> 00:08:28,644
So, I made the first one, second one,
and now I'm going to make the third one.

131
00:08:28,644 --> 00:08:31,644
I'm going to make it blue.

132
00:08:31,644 --> 00:08:34,644
Let's make the third one.

133
00:08:34,644 --> 00:08:37,644
First, I'm going to make it blue.

134
00:08:37,644 --> 00:08:39,644
Blue...

135
00:08:39,644 --> 00:08:43,644
I said blue, but Shiro said blue.

136
00:08:45,644 --> 00:08:47,644
What should I do?

137
00:08:47,644 --> 00:08:51,644
I want to make it round.

138
00:08:53,160 --> 00:08:55,160
This color is good.

139
00:08:57,160 --> 00:08:59,160
This color is good.

140
00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:02,160
It's like a military color.

141
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:04,160
It's good.

142
00:09:07,160 --> 00:09:09,160
Do you know this?

143
00:09:09,160 --> 00:09:12,160
I'm making this now.

144
00:09:13,160 --> 00:09:16,160
I was addicted to this for a while.

145
00:09:16,160 --> 00:09:21,160
I wore only that T-shirt.

146
00:09:22,488 --> 00:09:24,488
Do you know what it is?

147
00:09:25,488 --> 00:09:31,488
I've never seen this before.

148
00:09:32,488 --> 00:09:43,488
I think I've seen this before in a
watercolor book.

149
00:09:43,488 --> 00:09:50,488
I've never seen this before in a
watercolor book.

150
00:09:52,296 --> 00:09:54,296
It's very exquisite.

151
00:09:58,296 --> 00:10:00,296
It's not what I imagined.

152
00:10:02,296 --> 00:10:04,296
It's more difficult than I thought.

153
00:10:05,296 --> 00:10:07,296
I'll open it once.

154
00:10:08,296 --> 00:10:10,296
Wait a minute.

155
00:10:11,296 --> 00:10:13,296
Oh, I feel something.

156
00:10:13,296 --> 00:10:15,296
I feel something.

157
00:10:15,296 --> 00:10:17,296
It's very delicious.

158
00:10:19,418 --> 00:10:24,418
I think I'm getting there.

159
00:10:24,418 --> 00:10:32,418
I was looking around and this part came
out.

160
00:10:32,418 --> 00:10:36,064
The narrow part of the ktoś-kan is to
make examples of whom.

161
00:10:37,064 --> 00:10:41,064
I want to use this, but how do I use it?

162
00:10:41,064 --> 00:10:43,064
That's difficult.

163
00:10:43,064 --> 00:10:45,064
I'll stick it with glue.

164
00:10:45,064 --> 00:10:48,064
No, I can't.

165
00:10:48,064 --> 00:10:52,064
I don't know how to use this.

166
00:10:52,064 --> 00:10:55,064
How do I put it in?

167
00:10:55,064 --> 00:11:01,064
I'm not good at it.

168
00:11:02,264 --> 00:11:05,264
I don't know where to put this.

169
00:11:05,264 --> 00:11:09,264
It's been a while since I played with
LEGO.

170
00:11:09,264 --> 00:11:14,264
I didn't think I could concentrate on it
so much.

171
00:11:15,264 --> 00:11:17,264
It's a lot of fun.

172
00:11:17,264 --> 00:11:21,264
It's like I'm back to when I was a kid.

173
00:11:22,264 --> 00:11:24,264
I wonder how to put it on.

174
00:11:24,264 --> 00:11:27,264
I want to put eyes on it.

175
00:11:28,968 --> 00:11:30,968
I don't know how to put eyes on it.

176
00:11:30,968 --> 00:11:32,968
I turned this way.

177
00:11:33,968 --> 00:11:37,968
I want to put eyes on it, but I don't
know how to put eyes on it.

178
00:11:37,968 --> 00:11:39,968
I put eyes on it here.

179
00:11:39,968 --> 00:11:41,968
Where do I look at?

180
00:11:41,968 --> 00:11:43,968
It's difficult.

181
00:11:44,968 --> 00:11:46,968
How can I put eyes on it?

182
00:11:46,968 --> 00:11:48,968
Is this it?

183
00:11:48,968 --> 00:11:53,968
I don't think so.

184
00:11:57,848 --> 00:11:59,848
I put my eyes on it.

185
00:11:59,848 --> 00:12:03,848
You may not be able to see it, but it's
done.

186
00:12:04,848 --> 00:12:08,848
I don't know what it is because I don't
have my eyes on it.

187
00:12:08,848 --> 00:12:10,848
I'll show you from the side.

188
00:12:15,848 --> 00:12:17,848
The third one is done.

189
00:12:17,848 --> 00:12:22,848
The point is Mamoru.

190
00:12:25,064 --> 00:12:26,064
This is it.

191
00:12:27,064 --> 00:12:29,064
I really wanted to put eyes on it.

192
00:12:29,064 --> 00:12:31,064
I would have known if I put eyes on it.

193
00:12:31,064 --> 00:12:33,064
I put eyes on it.

194
00:12:33,064 --> 00:12:35,064
I made three.

195
00:12:36,064 --> 00:12:39,064
I made three.

196
00:12:41,064 --> 00:12:45,064
I will show you one by one.

197
00:12:45,064 --> 00:12:51,064
The second one is this.

198
00:12:53,096 --> 00:12:56,096
I think you can guess what this is.

199
00:12:56,096 --> 00:12:57,096
Yes, it is.

200
00:12:57,096 --> 00:13:01,096
This is an apple.

201
00:13:01,096 --> 00:13:03,096
Did you get it?

202
00:13:03,096 --> 00:13:07,096
It looks like it was eaten by a bug.

203
00:13:07,096 --> 00:13:09,096
There is a little inside.

204
00:13:09,096 --> 00:13:11,096
When I disassemble it,

205
00:13:11,096 --> 00:13:18,096
I put the white part of the inside.

206
00:13:18,096 --> 00:13:20,096
I made it.

207
00:13:20,096 --> 00:13:22,096
The leaves are also good.

208
00:13:22,096 --> 00:13:26,096
It looks like a honey of an apple.

209
00:13:26,096 --> 00:13:29,096
I put orange and brown.

210
00:13:29,096 --> 00:13:30,096
I made it.

211
00:13:30,096 --> 00:13:31,096
Did you get it?

212
00:13:31,096 --> 00:13:33,152
It was an apple.

213
00:13:34,152 --> 00:13:36,152
The second one is...

214
00:13:36,152 --> 00:13:38,152
Ta-da!

215
00:13:38,152 --> 00:13:43,152
Well, I think you can guess what this
is.

216
00:13:43,152 --> 00:13:46,152
The point is this building.

217
00:13:46,152 --> 00:13:50,152
I made it with particular care today.

218
00:13:50,152 --> 00:13:52,152
Did you get it?

219
00:13:52,152 --> 00:13:54,152
The correct answer is...

220
00:13:54,152 --> 00:13:59,152
It was a residential area in the middle
of development.

221
00:13:59,152 --> 00:14:01,136
This is...

222
00:14:02,136 --> 00:14:08,136
I made it with the image of a drugstore.

223
00:14:08,136 --> 00:14:11,136
I made it with the image of a drugstore.

224
00:14:17,136 --> 00:14:20,136
I was particular about this.

225
00:14:20,136 --> 00:14:23,136
It was hard to match the colors.

226
00:14:23,136 --> 00:14:25,136
I thought it would be enough to make a
block.

227
00:14:25,136 --> 00:14:29,728
I made it with the image of a light.

228
00:14:30,728 --> 00:14:36,728
I think I can build a house next year.

229
00:14:37,728 --> 00:14:40,728
It was a residential area in the middle
of a reversal.

230
00:14:42,728 --> 00:14:44,728
The third one.

231
00:14:48,728 --> 00:14:52,728
It is difficult to reproduce.

232
00:14:53,728 --> 00:14:56,728
You may not know.

233
00:14:56,728 --> 00:14:58,728
The point is here.

234
00:15:00,424 --> 00:15:02,424
Did you get it?

235
00:15:02,424 --> 00:15:04,424
I wanted to make eyes.

236
00:15:08,424 --> 00:15:10,424
It's blue.

237
00:15:10,424 --> 00:15:12,424
Did you get it?

238
00:15:13,424 --> 00:15:15,424
What did I make?

239
00:15:17,424 --> 00:15:19,424
The answer is a whale.

240
00:15:19,424 --> 00:15:21,424
Did you get it?

241
00:15:21,424 --> 00:15:25,424
This is a whale.

242
00:15:26,192 --> 00:15:31,192
It's not a head, but it's coming out of
its head.

243
00:15:31,192 --> 00:15:39,192
So, to recreate a whale coming out of
the water,

244
00:15:39,192 --> 00:15:47,192
I put a wave on it.

245
00:15:47,192 --> 00:15:50,192
I think this is the most important
point.

246
00:15:50,192 --> 00:15:53,192
The color is cute, too.

247
00:15:53,192 --> 00:15:55,696
I just couldn't get my eyes on it.

248
00:15:56,696 --> 00:15:59,696
So, did you get the whale?

249
00:16:00,696 --> 00:16:02,696
I put three on it.

250
00:16:02,696 --> 00:16:05,696
I'd like to give it a score.

251
00:16:06,696 --> 00:16:09,696
Well, the score is...

252
00:16:09,696 --> 00:16:10,696
Out of 100,

253
00:16:12,696 --> 00:16:15,696
I was the third one, so I'm the most
used to it.

254
00:16:15,696 --> 00:16:19,696
The third one is 34 points.

255
00:16:19,696 --> 00:16:22,696
34 points.

256
00:16:22,696 --> 00:16:24,528
Whale, 34 points.

257
00:16:25,528 --> 00:16:27,528
I can't make eyes.

258
00:16:29,528 --> 00:16:31,528
I can't say anything.

259
00:16:36,528 --> 00:16:41,528
I was particular about the housing price
during the development.

260
00:16:41,528 --> 00:16:47,528
I want to make the score high.

261
00:16:47,528 --> 00:16:53,528
82 points.

262
00:16:54,432 --> 00:16:56,432
I'm still developing.

263
00:16:56,432 --> 00:17:00,432
But this is the best I've ever made.

264
00:17:00,432 --> 00:17:06,432
And I found the window parts.

265
00:17:06,432 --> 00:17:10,432
The chimney was transparent and
fashionable.

266
00:17:10,432 --> 00:17:14,432
So, the housing price is 82 points.

267
00:17:14,432 --> 00:17:16,432
And,

268
00:17:16,432 --> 00:17:18,432
apples.

269
00:17:18,432 --> 00:17:24,432
This is the first one I made.

270
00:17:25,448 --> 00:17:27,448
I think it is a good one.

271
00:17:28,448 --> 00:17:30,448
The inside is white.

272
00:17:31,448 --> 00:17:33,448
I reproduced the part I can eat.

273
00:17:34,448 --> 00:17:36,448
So, 100 points!

274
00:17:37,448 --> 00:17:39,448
Apples are the best.

275
00:17:41,448 --> 00:17:42,448
3 points.

276
00:17:43,448 --> 00:17:45,448
I made it like this.

277
00:17:45,448 --> 00:17:50,416
Please give me a score.

278
00:17:51,416 --> 00:17:55,416
I made three so far.

279
00:17:55,416 --> 00:18:04,416
I will make a super countermeasure.

280
00:18:04,416 --> 00:18:16,416
I will make three and try to make a
super countermeasure.

281
00:18:16,416 --> 00:18:18,160
Yes.

282
00:18:18,160 --> 00:18:22,660
I will start the super measure.

283
00:18:22,660 --> 00:18:23,660
I will try it.

284
00:18:24,160 --> 00:18:31,660
First, I will use white board.

285
00:18:32,660 --> 00:18:35,160
How should I make it?

286
00:18:35,160 --> 00:18:37,660
First, I will use this.

287
00:18:37,660 --> 00:18:39,160
This is the base.

288
00:18:39,160 --> 00:18:41,160
I will make it from now.

289
00:18:41,660 --> 00:18:43,160
I will do this.

290
00:18:43,160 --> 00:18:47,160
I want to use this.

291
00:18:48,920 --> 00:18:50,920
I want to use tires.

292
00:18:50,920 --> 00:19:02,554
I want to use tires and noodles.

293
00:19:02,554 --> 00:19:04,554
I got it.

294
00:19:04,554 --> 00:19:06,554
I got it.

295
00:19:06,554 --> 00:19:08,554
I made a tire.

296
00:19:08,554 --> 00:19:10,554
I made four tires.

297
00:19:10,554 --> 00:19:12,554
It's good that I made it, but

298
00:19:12,554 --> 00:19:14,554
I'm going to

299
00:19:14,554 --> 00:19:16,554
put the tires together

300
00:19:16,554 --> 00:19:18,554
like this.

301
00:19:20,554 --> 00:19:22,554
I'm going to work.

302
00:19:26,554 --> 00:19:28,554
I'm going to make a drain.

303
00:19:28,554 --> 00:19:30,304
I'm going to make a drain.

304
00:19:31,304 --> 00:19:33,304
No, not this.

305
00:19:33,304 --> 00:19:35,304
I thought it was this.

306
00:19:41,304 --> 00:19:43,304
I don't use tires for this.

307
00:19:44,304 --> 00:19:46,304
How can I put on tires?

308
00:19:48,304 --> 00:19:50,304
Is this it?

309
00:19:50,304 --> 00:19:54,304
I was able to put on tires.

310
00:19:54,304 --> 00:19:58,304
This is the part I made.

311
00:19:59,592 --> 00:20:01,592
Wow, I see.

312
00:20:02,592 --> 00:20:04,592
It looks like this.

313
00:20:05,592 --> 00:20:07,592
It's a car.

314
00:20:08,592 --> 00:20:13,592
Next, I will make the torso.

315
00:20:18,592 --> 00:20:20,592
I should have searched more.

316
00:20:20,592 --> 00:20:22,128
It's like a bronco.

317
00:20:23,128 --> 00:20:31,128
I'm showing you all the small parts.

318
00:20:31,128 --> 00:20:34,128
White, gray and black.

319
00:20:34,128 --> 00:20:38,128
It will be a pattern.

320
00:20:38,128 --> 00:20:48,128
If I can do it, I will do it.

321
00:20:48,128 --> 00:20:53,128
I think you will be like, oh, I see.

322
00:20:53,128 --> 00:20:56,128
Can I do it? I think I can do it.

323
00:20:56,128 --> 00:20:59,128
I think I can do it.

324
00:21:00,728 --> 00:21:02,728
So far, it's like this.

325
00:21:02,728 --> 00:21:04,728
The color is like this.

326
00:21:04,728 --> 00:21:06,728
I'm going to add eyes.

327
00:21:06,728 --> 00:21:08,728
I learned how to add eyes.

328
00:21:08,728 --> 00:21:11,728
I was going to add this, but...

329
00:21:11,728 --> 00:21:14,728
To make it look more like it,

330
00:21:14,728 --> 00:21:18,896
I'm going to add only black eyes.

331
00:21:19,896 --> 00:21:23,896
I think this is good.

332
00:21:24,896 --> 00:21:28,896
I think this is the easiest way to draw.

333
00:21:29,896 --> 00:21:31,896
I got it.

334
00:21:31,896 --> 00:21:33,896
I got it.

335
00:21:33,896 --> 00:21:38,896
I think this is good.

336
00:21:45,338 --> 00:21:46,278
🐆 What?

337
00:21:46,278 --> 00:21:47,158
🐆 Huh?

338
00:21:47,258 --> 00:21:49,678
Like this!

339
00:21:50,478 --> 00:21:53,998
The time to wear the little eyes...

340
00:21:54,498 --> 00:21:57,038
...and do the parting of the moscow
dolls...

341
00:21:57,558 --> 00:22:00,678
Came晚 à temps que je vais wear the
little eyes!

342
00:22:02,758 --> 00:22:04,258
Please step on the hole.

343
00:22:04,258 --> 00:22:09,258
Thank you for watching.

344
00:22:09,498 --> 00:22:11,498
Yaaaaay

345
00:22:11,498 --> 00:22:13,498
Yaaaaaaaaay

346
00:22:13,498 --> 00:22:15,498
Yaaaaaaaaaaay

347
00:22:15,498 --> 00:22:17,498
Okay

348
00:22:17,498 --> 00:22:19,498
So

349
00:22:19,498 --> 00:22:21,498
My

350
00:22:21,498 --> 00:22:23,498
Invitation is done!

351
00:22:25,498 --> 00:22:27,498
Ta-dah!

352
00:22:29,498 --> 00:22:31,498
Ta-dah!

353
00:22:33,498 --> 00:22:35,498
Guys

354
00:22:35,498 --> 00:22:37,498
Can you see it?

355
00:22:37,498 --> 00:22:39,104
Did you see it?

356
00:22:40,104 --> 00:22:45,104
I made three.

357
00:22:46,104 --> 00:22:48,104
How do you think?

358
00:22:49,104 --> 00:22:51,104
Did you understand?

359
00:22:54,104 --> 00:22:57,104
It's done!

360
00:22:57,104 --> 00:22:59,104
I made it!

361
00:23:02,416 --> 00:23:07,416
So, I finished making the special dish.

362
00:23:07,416 --> 00:23:10,416
It's a shrimp.

363
00:23:10,416 --> 00:23:14,416
Do you know what this is?

364
00:23:14,416 --> 00:23:17,416
This is a shrimp sushi.

365
00:23:17,416 --> 00:23:22,416
I hope I could recreate the shrimp sushi
you often see.

366
00:23:22,416 --> 00:23:31,416
I wanted to make this part, but I
couldn't find it.

367
00:23:31,416 --> 00:23:37,416
I put the rice on the sushi.

368
00:23:37,416 --> 00:23:41,416
It's a two-plate of shrimp sushi.

369
00:23:41,416 --> 00:23:49,416
I put the shrimp on the sushi.

370
00:23:49,416 --> 00:23:52,416
I put the shrimp on the sushi.

371
00:23:52,416 --> 00:23:54,416
I put the shrimp on the sushi.

372
00:23:55,712 --> 00:23:57,132
I can put the shrimp like this.

373
00:23:59,772 --> 00:24:03,612
I mixed the shrimp with the scissors and
put the shrimp on it.

374
00:24:08,732 --> 00:24:15,492
I put on the shrimp.

375
00:24:15,492 --> 00:24:18,092
It's not like a crab, but it's a shrimp.

376
00:24:18,332 --> 00:24:20,792
This is a shrimp.

377
00:24:21,412 --> 00:24:23,932
And this.

378
00:24:24,932 --> 00:24:26,672
Did you know?

379
00:24:27,072 --> 00:24:31,052
This is also a shrimp.

380
00:24:32,072 --> 00:24:33,072
Did you know?

381
00:24:33,812 --> 00:24:34,812
The answer is

382
00:24:35,652 --> 00:24:38,652
It was a car shrimp.

383
00:24:38,652 --> 00:24:42,852
So I put a tire on it and made it a car
shrimp.

384
00:24:42,852 --> 00:24:45,852
How is it?

385
00:24:45,852 --> 00:24:51,132
I thought it was a little black.

386
00:24:51,132 --> 00:24:58,692
And the fan club of shrimp is a type of
shrimp called Black Tiger.

387
00:24:59,372 --> 00:25:02,172
So I made a car shrimp.

388
00:25:05,852 --> 00:25:09,412
It took 40 minutes to make this.

389
00:25:09,412 --> 00:25:14,412
I didn't think I was doing that much.

390
00:25:14,412 --> 00:25:19,412
It's been a while since I concentrated.

391
00:25:19,412 --> 00:25:25,812
It's a really funest video of Lego.

392
00:25:25,812 --> 00:25:28,852
It's been a while since I made Lego.

393
00:25:28,992 --> 00:25:29,296
I want you to make Lego.

394
00:25:30,296 --> 00:25:32,296
I'll get it later.

395
00:25:32,296 --> 00:25:34,296
I'll get it soon.

396
00:25:34,296 --> 00:25:40,800
I made a shrimp plate.

397
00:25:41,800 --> 00:25:45,800
I think I made it pretty well.

398
00:25:45,800 --> 00:25:48,800
What do you think?

399
00:25:50,800 --> 00:25:51,800
What do you think?

400
00:25:51,800 --> 00:25:59,800
I tried to put a lot of effort into the
car shrimp, but I like the shrimp I made
last.

401
00:25:59,800 --> 00:26:02,800
The point is the scissors.

402
00:26:02,800 --> 00:26:11,800
I had a great time, so I hope you'll
come to the block next time.

403
00:26:11,800 --> 00:26:13,800
That's all for the face studio.

404
00:26:13,800 --> 00:26:19,741
Bye bye.
