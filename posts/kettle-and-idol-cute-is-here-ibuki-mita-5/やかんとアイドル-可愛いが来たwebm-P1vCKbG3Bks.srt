1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,840
Nakano Idol

2
00:00:04,122 --> 00:00:05,584
Wha?!

3
00:00:05,584 --> 00:00:07,584
Now, let's move on to the ending.

4
00:00:07,584 --> 00:00:09,584
Do you have any announcements?

5
00:00:09,584 --> 00:00:15,584
Yes, we will be releasing our second
album, Live, on December 20th.

6
00:00:15,584 --> 00:00:17,584
Thank you.

7
00:00:17,584 --> 00:00:27,584
This second album, Live, has four new
songs added to the album,

8
00:00:27,584 --> 00:00:31,584
and we also have a live video of it at
Toyosu Pit.

9
00:00:31,584 --> 00:00:40,584
This time, we have five members, and...

10
00:00:42,224 --> 00:00:47,544
this has been our path from the
perspective of the five of us.

11
00:00:47,776 --> 00:00:50,476
What was the name of the song?

12
00:00:50,476 --> 00:00:53,636
It's okay, you can just squeeze it out.

13
00:00:53,636 --> 00:00:57,136
I want to capture your face right now.

14
00:00:57,136 --> 00:01:03,336
So, this is what happened to Ayumi and
the five of us.

15
00:01:03,336 --> 00:01:08,816
Yes, it's been a challenge and a
resolution since the five of us.

16
00:01:08,816 --> 00:01:16,316
I think that the path we've taken has
become one with this album.

17
00:01:16,316 --> 00:01:20,316
I hope you all get it.

18
00:01:20,316 --> 00:01:24,076
So, what's next for this album?

19
00:01:24,076 --> 00:01:30,176
We're going to be holding our first and
only transparent tour in 2023.

20
00:01:30,176 --> 00:01:33,416
That's right, our first and only
transparent tour.

21
00:01:33,416 --> 00:01:36,316
We're going back to Ebisu.

22
00:01:36,316 --> 00:01:38,576
Tokyo, Nagoya, Osaka.

23
00:01:38,576 --> 00:01:40,316
Is this your first time doing this?

24
00:01:40,316 --> 00:01:41,116
It's my first time.

25
00:01:41,116 --> 00:01:45,216
I've done a solo live in Nagoya before.

26
00:01:45,216 --> 00:01:51,316
No, it's my first time doing a tour in
Nagoya and Osaka.

27
00:01:51,316 --> 00:01:52,776
I see.

28
00:01:52,776 --> 00:01:54,916
I'm going to have to go there if I'm a
fan.

29
00:01:54,916 --> 00:01:56,816
Yes, please do.

30
00:01:56,816 --> 00:02:03,016
So, we can't take our eyes off the club
next year.

31
00:02:03,016 --> 00:02:04,516
But this is a special episode.

32
00:02:04,516 --> 00:02:11,016
I'm a night watchman, so I'd like you to
drink tea from the night watchman.

33
00:02:11,016 --> 00:02:16,016
Today, we're going to drink Shizuoka's
Makinohara tea.

34
00:02:16,016 --> 00:02:19,016
It's green tea.

35
00:02:19,016 --> 00:02:21,016
I think it's my first time drinking
Shizuoka's tea.

36
00:02:21,016 --> 00:02:22,216
Oh, really?

37
00:02:22,216 --> 00:02:23,716
Kaz, do you drink tea?

38
00:02:23,716 --> 00:02:26,516
I usually drink water.

39
00:02:26,516 --> 00:02:29,016
I'm not trying to make you laugh, but
that's great.

40
00:02:29,016 --> 00:02:31,216
You're very particular about your tea.

41
00:02:31,216 --> 00:02:32,516
Maybe I am.

42
00:02:32,516 --> 00:02:37,016
Do you have a favorite water?

43
00:02:37,016 --> 00:02:39,616
I'm not particularly particular about my
tea.

44
00:02:39,616 --> 00:02:44,216
But I can tell that you're not good at
drinking water.

45
00:02:44,216 --> 00:02:47,416
But I'm not particularly good at
drinking water.

46
00:02:47,416 --> 00:02:53,516
I've tried a lot of different waters,
but I've never been good at drinking
water.

47
00:02:53,516 --> 00:02:56,616
I've come to feel that way.

48
00:02:56,616 --> 00:02:59,416
Then I'll try it.

49
00:02:59,416 --> 00:03:01,216
Please drink it.

50
00:03:01,216 --> 00:03:04,688
Thank you for your tea.

51
00:03:05,688 --> 00:03:07,688
Oh, you're going to drink it?

52
00:03:07,688 --> 00:03:09,688
I thought you were going to drink it.

53
00:03:09,688 --> 00:03:13,688
I'm a little nervous because I'm eating
in front of people.

54
00:03:13,688 --> 00:03:14,688
Oh, really?

55
00:03:14,688 --> 00:03:15,688
Yes.

56
00:03:15,688 --> 00:03:16,688
Thank you for the tea.

57
00:03:16,688 --> 00:03:17,688
I'll try not to look.

58
00:03:17,688 --> 00:03:18,688
Can I drink it?

59
00:03:18,688 --> 00:03:19,688
Close your eyes.

60
00:03:19,688 --> 00:03:20,688
Thank you for the tea.

61
00:03:20,688 --> 00:03:21,688
Thank you.

62
00:03:24,688 --> 00:03:25,688
Hmm.

63
00:03:25,688 --> 00:03:26,688
How is it?

64
00:03:27,688 --> 00:03:28,688
You always drink water, Mika.

65
00:03:28,688 --> 00:03:30,688
Can I drink it again?

66
00:03:30,688 --> 00:03:32,688
Yes.

67
00:03:35,032 --> 00:03:37,032
It's good.

68
00:03:37,032 --> 00:03:39,032
I'm glad.

69
00:03:39,032 --> 00:03:41,032
It's smooth.

70
00:03:41,032 --> 00:03:46,032
I thought this kind of tea was very
strong, but it's easy to drink.

71
00:03:48,032 --> 00:03:51,032
Can I ask you one last thing?

72
00:03:51,032 --> 00:03:53,032
What is it?

73
00:03:53,032 --> 00:03:55,032
You're so cute.

74
00:03:55,032 --> 00:04:00,032
You're so cute that you're closing this
show to the camera.

75
00:04:00,032 --> 00:04:04,032
What? Everyone in the hotel is doing it.

76
00:04:06,032 --> 00:04:08,032
You're so cute.

77
00:04:08,032 --> 00:04:13,032
I'm going to do it.

78
00:04:14,536 --> 00:04:19,536
Thank you for watching the video.

79
00:04:19,536 --> 00:04:23,536
I'm Ibuki Mita.

80
00:04:31,536 --> 00:04:33,536
I'm OK.

81
00:04:33,536 --> 00:04:37,536
I'm burned.

82
00:04:42,394 --> 00:05:01,394
This program is brought to you by
Zundare, Iseki Arinoshi, Yosshi, My
Monster, and Mitata Aoshi GTO.

83
00:05:01,394 --> 00:05:05,394
Thank you for watching.

84
00:05:05,394 --> 00:05:13,394
Christmas is coming soon, so I hope you
have a wonderful Christmas.
