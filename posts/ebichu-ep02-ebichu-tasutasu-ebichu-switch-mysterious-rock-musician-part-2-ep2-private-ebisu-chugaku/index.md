Contents: Continuing from last week, the theme this time is "Ebichu + Switch". A mysterious rock musician barges in while observing the Switch product test! It was a strange person!
In addition, we decided to compete in the quick-press quiz with a quick-press switch instead of a quick-press button. The members struggled with the feeling of pressing the subtle switches. Finally, Matsuno made a shocking remark. Outrageous shout pops out! ?
And we'll also deliver the latest information on Ebichu research student Sakura Ebi-zu!
