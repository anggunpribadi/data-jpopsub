1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
This week's Ebichu Tastas continues from
last week

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Ebichu Tastas switch

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:12,000
Suddenly an unknown man enters

4
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:16,000
Furthermore, a quick-pressing switch
quiz is held

5
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:19,000
Something is exciting

6
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:22,000
Ebichu Tastas start

7
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:29,000
By the way, Hina Kashiwagi is off this
week

8
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:02,800
Final

9
00:01:05,300 --> 00:01:09,320
Music

10
00:01:10,440 --> 00:01:14,280
There are various things to utan around
Ebisu!

11
00:01:14,280 --> 00:01:16,280
Emi Jujutsu!

12
00:01:19,472 --> 00:01:23,472
This program is brought to you by these
sponsors

13
00:01:33,472 --> 00:01:39,472
The members of the shrimp chu team who
have been participating in the switch
manufacturing company since last week

14
00:01:39,472 --> 00:01:44,672
This week's shrimp chu plus switch is

15
00:01:44,672 --> 00:01:49,672
I'm going to the next room.

16
00:01:55,344 --> 00:01:59,344
The first room that Ebi-chuu visited was
the testing room

17
00:01:59,344 --> 00:02:01,344
What kind of room is it?

18
00:02:01,344 --> 00:02:07,344
Last week, we asked Aoyama san, a
professional switch maker

19
00:02:07,344 --> 00:02:11,344
Aoyama san, what is this room?

20
00:02:11,344 --> 00:02:19,344
This room is for checking the durability
of the switch made at the factory

21
00:02:19,344 --> 00:02:26,344
Ebi-chuu plus switch test

22
00:02:26,344 --> 00:02:31,344
With this machine, they check the
durability of the switch

23
00:02:31,344 --> 00:02:37,344
When there are many, they have to buy 5
million times

24
00:02:37,344 --> 00:02:42,344
This is like the semi-finals of a comic
book competition

25
00:02:42,344 --> 00:02:48,344
It's hard to go to the finals from here

26
00:02:48,344 --> 00:02:55,344
And these are the switches that passed
all the tests

27
00:02:55,344 --> 00:03:01,376
The new switch that passed all the tests

28
00:03:01,376 --> 00:03:03,376
Did you pass all the endurance tests?

29
00:03:03,376 --> 00:03:05,376
Elite!

30
00:03:05,376 --> 00:03:08,376
No one has touched it yet

31
00:03:08,376 --> 00:03:10,376
Congratulations!

32
00:03:10,376 --> 00:03:12,376
Thank you!

33
00:03:12,376 --> 00:03:14,376
Thank you!

34
00:03:16,376 --> 00:03:19,376
Enichu Pass Switch Test

35
00:03:19,376 --> 00:03:21,376
Thank you!

36
00:03:21,376 --> 00:03:24,160
Switch speaks

37
00:03:24,160 --> 00:03:31,160
Today, we can only push one person.

38
00:03:31,160 --> 00:03:33,160
Who wants to push?

39
00:03:33,160 --> 00:03:35,160
Wait a minute!

40
00:03:35,160 --> 00:03:37,160
What happened?

41
00:03:37,160 --> 00:03:38,160
This voice is...

42
00:03:38,160 --> 00:03:41,160
Wait a minute to push the switch!

43
00:03:41,160 --> 00:03:43,160
Who is it?

44
00:03:43,160 --> 00:03:45,160
It's a park!

45
00:03:45,160 --> 00:03:49,160
Everyone, you have forgotten the lyrics
in the park.

46
00:03:49,160 --> 00:03:52,160
Who are you?

47
00:03:52,160 --> 00:03:59,160
I'm a Japanese rock band.

48
00:03:59,160 --> 00:04:04,640
I'm a piano vocalist, Kaiki Ogata.

49
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:06,640
I don't use guitar.

50
00:04:14,224 --> 00:04:17,524
I'm a little bit

51
00:04:17,524 --> 00:04:21,924
Indies band here's vocalist Kaiki Ogata

52
00:04:21,924 --> 00:04:27,564
It's kind of interesting, so I chose it
for the cast member

53
00:04:27,564 --> 00:04:32,124
It's like this, but I've been greeting
you very politely at the academy

54
00:04:32,124 --> 00:04:34,364
I haven't said a polite greeting

55
00:04:34,364 --> 00:04:37,164
Rock is a crime

56
00:04:37,164 --> 00:04:39,364
Do you understand everyone

57
00:04:39,364 --> 00:04:43,564
I just want to be suspicious

58
00:04:43,564 --> 00:04:45,564
I'm afraid I'm a little bit

59
00:04:45,564 --> 00:04:47,564
I'm a little bit

60
00:04:47,564 --> 00:04:49,564
I'm a little bit

61
00:04:49,564 --> 00:04:53,564
Everyone was watching me with a very
suspicious look

62
00:04:53,564 --> 00:05:00,564
Actually, Kaichi Ogata, who was quietly
participating in the opening shoot of
the program

63
00:05:00,564 --> 00:05:08,128
When Yasumoto worships

64
00:05:08,128 --> 00:05:12,128
He returned it to Richi

65
00:05:12,128 --> 00:05:14,128
Are you okay? I'm not swimming

66
00:05:14,128 --> 00:05:18,864
I'm not swimming, but I'm bleeding a lot

67
00:05:18,864 --> 00:05:19,864
What is that?

68
00:05:19,864 --> 00:05:20,864
Everyone, is the performance okay?

69
00:05:20,864 --> 00:05:21,864
The script is terrible

70
00:05:21,864 --> 00:05:22,864
It's fun

71
00:05:23,864 --> 00:05:24,864
It's fun

72
00:05:26,864 --> 00:05:30,864
Erichu plus Ogata Kaiki is

73
00:05:31,864 --> 00:05:33,864
So, the new switch is over

74
00:05:33,864 --> 00:05:39,600
Ogata Kaiki's Who's the Winner Quiz

75
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:51,600
We don't know who the new member is, so
we will do a quiz about Ogata Kaiki with
a new switch

76
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:59,600
Please look at this. There is a switch
that doesn't have a quick press button

77
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:09,600
This is a special quick press switch
made with the NKK switches

78
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:15,600
Everyone can sit wherever you want

79
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:20,600
Let's do the one in front of you

80
00:06:20,600 --> 00:06:23,600
It's like a Rika's experiment

81
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:25,504
Eita is over there

82
00:06:25,504 --> 00:06:32,504
Wait a minute, now, I've been trying to
talk to the company for a long time, so
I've been timing it several times.

83
00:06:32,504 --> 00:06:38,504
Let's ask a little bit. Everyone, please
take the switch you want to press with a
strong desire.

84
00:06:38,504 --> 00:06:40,504
Do you understand?

85
00:06:40,504 --> 00:06:43,504
I didn't ask one by one.

86
00:06:43,504 --> 00:06:47,504
I don't think I'll notice if I get this.

87
00:06:47,504 --> 00:06:49,504
What's wrong, Hirota?

88
00:06:49,504 --> 00:06:51,504
It's shining.

89
00:06:51,504 --> 00:06:52,504
It's shining.

90
00:06:52,504 --> 00:06:55,504
Please appeal it yourself.

91
00:06:55,504 --> 00:06:56,504
Yes, switch.

92
00:06:56,504 --> 00:06:58,504
Question 1

93
00:06:58,504 --> 00:07:03,504
What is the thing that Ogata Kaiji wants
the most now?

94
00:07:03,504 --> 00:07:04,504
It's fast.

95
00:07:04,504 --> 00:07:06,504
Kobayashi was fast.

96
00:07:06,504 --> 00:07:08,504
Switch

97
00:07:08,504 --> 00:07:09,504
Switch

98
00:07:09,504 --> 00:07:11,504
I see.

99
00:07:11,504 --> 00:07:13,504
The switch is different.

100
00:07:13,504 --> 00:07:14,504
It's different.

101
00:07:14,504 --> 00:07:16,504
Everyone is a little scared.

102
00:07:16,504 --> 00:07:17,504
I'm a little scared.

103
00:07:17,504 --> 00:07:19,504
I'm a little scared.

104
00:07:19,504 --> 00:07:23,504
I'll choose the first one that shined.

105
00:07:23,504 --> 00:07:25,504
I'll go.

106
00:07:25,504 --> 00:07:27,504
Yes, please.

107
00:07:30,504 --> 00:07:32,504
Don't raise your hand.

108
00:07:32,504 --> 00:07:33,504
Do you know?

109
00:07:33,504 --> 00:07:35,504
I don't know.

110
00:07:35,504 --> 00:07:36,504
What?

111
00:07:36,504 --> 00:07:38,504
I don't know.

112
00:07:38,504 --> 00:07:40,504
It will shine when it shines.

113
00:07:40,504 --> 00:07:42,504
It doesn't have a quick reaction.

114
00:07:42,504 --> 00:07:43,504
Are you okay?

115
00:07:43,504 --> 00:07:45,504
Do you want a hint?

116
00:07:45,504 --> 00:07:46,504
I want it.

117
00:07:46,504 --> 00:07:49,504
It's about the food.

118
00:07:49,504 --> 00:07:51,504
The food?

119
00:07:51,504 --> 00:07:53,504
I'm scared.

120
00:07:53,504 --> 00:07:55,504
Nakayama?

121
00:07:55,504 --> 00:07:56,504
Yes.

122
00:07:56,504 --> 00:07:57,504
Courage.

123
00:07:57,504 --> 00:07:59,504
Courage.

124
00:07:59,504 --> 00:08:01,504
Courage that comes out in front.

125
00:08:01,504 --> 00:08:06,504
I thought I was missing courage after
seeing the current situation.

126
00:08:06,504 --> 00:08:08,504
What did you think, Chie?

127
00:08:08,504 --> 00:08:11,504
Kobayashi was next to me and didn't
understand the meaning of the food.

128
00:08:11,504 --> 00:08:13,504
I'm not in the mood for that.

129
00:08:13,504 --> 00:08:16,504
I'm in a state of being stupid.

130
00:08:16,504 --> 00:08:20,504
Courage is not.

131
00:08:20,504 --> 00:08:23,504
And the food is.

132
00:08:23,504 --> 00:08:28,504
I eat what I do to live.

133
00:08:28,504 --> 00:08:31,504
It's a lamp.

134
00:08:31,504 --> 00:08:34,504
It's like a lamp on your head.

135
00:08:34,504 --> 00:08:36,504
It's like an anime.

136
00:08:36,504 --> 00:08:38,504
It's a glittering lamp.

137
00:08:38,504 --> 00:08:40,504
I got the feeling.

138
00:08:40,504 --> 00:08:41,504
Kobayashi.

139
00:08:41,504 --> 00:08:43,504
Room.

140
00:08:43,504 --> 00:08:47,248
Correct.

141
00:08:47,248 --> 00:08:53,248
To be exact, it's Bunjou Mansion.

142
00:08:53,248 --> 00:08:57,248
What is Bunjou Mansion?

143
00:08:57,248 --> 00:09:02,248
The quick-pushing switch quiz continues.

144
00:09:02,248 --> 00:09:10,224
It's fun.

145
00:09:10,224 --> 00:09:19,224
The first question is correct.

146
00:09:19,224 --> 00:09:22,224
Next question is the second question.

147
00:09:22,224 --> 00:09:24,224
I'll go.

148
00:09:24,224 --> 00:09:25,224
Please.

149
00:09:25,224 --> 00:09:31,224
When you start talking, you don't have
to give it to me.

150
00:09:31,224 --> 00:09:34,224
You can talk to me.

151
00:09:34,224 --> 00:09:35,224
Are you okay?

152
00:09:35,224 --> 00:09:36,224
I'm fine.

153
00:09:36,224 --> 00:09:37,224
I understand.

154
00:09:37,224 --> 00:09:42,224
What about Matsuno?

155
00:09:42,224 --> 00:09:45,224
It's fun.

156
00:09:46,224 --> 00:09:48,224
I'll do my best.

157
00:09:48,224 --> 00:09:49,224
Let's go to the second question.

158
00:09:49,224 --> 00:09:51,224
I'll go to the second question.

159
00:09:51,224 --> 00:09:56,224
What was the name of the old sea
monster?

160
00:09:56,224 --> 00:09:57,224
Hoshino was fast.

161
00:09:57,224 --> 00:10:00,224
Yokai.

162
00:10:00,224 --> 00:10:02,224
Why Yokai?

163
00:10:02,224 --> 00:10:07,224
I was a yokai including the old sea
monster.

164
00:10:07,224 --> 00:10:09,224
It's very close.

165
00:10:09,224 --> 00:10:12,224
The old sea monster is the real name.

166
00:10:12,224 --> 00:10:15,224
What else?

167
00:10:15,224 --> 00:10:16,224
Matsuno.

168
00:10:16,224 --> 00:10:18,224
Flower man.

169
00:10:20,224 --> 00:10:22,224
This is it.

170
00:10:22,224 --> 00:10:24,224
It's a pollen disease.

171
00:10:24,224 --> 00:10:26,224
It's a flower man.

172
00:10:26,224 --> 00:10:28,224
No.

173
00:10:28,224 --> 00:10:29,224
It's not a flower man.

174
00:10:29,224 --> 00:10:30,224
When was this story?

175
00:10:30,224 --> 00:10:33,224
This is when I was in elementary school.

176
00:10:33,224 --> 00:10:35,224
I'm not a flower man yet.

177
00:10:35,224 --> 00:10:37,224
Please give me another hint.

178
00:10:37,224 --> 00:10:39,224
Kaiki something.

179
00:10:39,224 --> 00:10:40,224
Yes.

180
00:10:40,224 --> 00:10:44,314
Please give me another hint.

181
00:10:44,314 --> 00:10:46,314
Too much luck!

182
00:10:46,528 --> 00:10:48,528
Yasumoto!

183
00:10:48,528 --> 00:10:50,528
A phantom of the sea!

184
00:10:50,528 --> 00:10:52,528
Correct!

185
00:10:52,528 --> 00:10:58,528
When I was in elementary school, I was
called a phantom of the sea

186
00:10:58,528 --> 00:11:02,528
How did you feel?

187
00:11:02,528 --> 00:11:08,528
Well, now that I think about it, I think
it's a simple nickname

188
00:11:08,528 --> 00:11:10,528
I'm sorry

189
00:11:10,528 --> 00:11:12,528
I'm sorry

190
00:11:12,528 --> 00:11:14,528
I'm sorry

191
00:11:14,528 --> 00:11:16,528
What's wrong?

192
00:11:16,528 --> 00:11:18,528
It's funny

193
00:11:18,528 --> 00:11:20,528
It's funny, right?

194
00:11:20,528 --> 00:11:22,528
It's funny, right?

195
00:11:22,528 --> 00:11:24,528
You answer everything seriously

196
00:11:26,528 --> 00:11:28,528
Question 3

197
00:11:28,528 --> 00:11:34,528
What is the saddest thing about Kaeki
Ogata recently?

198
00:11:34,528 --> 00:11:40,528
The price of ordering it was too high

199
00:11:40,528 --> 00:11:45,528
That's also correct, but it's about the
clothes

200
00:11:45,528 --> 00:11:49,528
By the way, how much is this suit?

201
00:11:49,528 --> 00:11:52,528
Are you going to announce the price?

202
00:11:52,528 --> 00:11:53,528
Yes, yes!

203
00:11:53,528 --> 00:11:55,528
3800 yen

204
00:11:55,528 --> 00:11:57,528
Yes, yes!

205
00:11:58,528 --> 00:12:00,528
10,000 yen

206
00:12:00,528 --> 00:12:02,528
Can you stop this quiz?

207
00:12:02,528 --> 00:12:05,528
Did you notice that the quiz changed?

208
00:12:05,528 --> 00:12:07,528
I just noticed

209
00:12:07,528 --> 00:12:09,528
Please give us a hint

210
00:12:09,528 --> 00:12:13,528
It's about the size of the clothes

211
00:12:13,528 --> 00:12:14,528
What about Nakayama?

212
00:12:14,528 --> 00:12:17,528
I grew up and became small

213
00:12:17,528 --> 00:12:19,528
I know!

214
00:12:19,528 --> 00:12:21,528
But it's close, right?

215
00:12:21,528 --> 00:12:23,528
Matsuno!

216
00:12:23,528 --> 00:12:27,968
I ordered it because it was small

217
00:12:27,968 --> 00:12:29,968
Almost correct!

218
00:12:31,952 --> 00:12:33,952
Please give us the correct answer

219
00:12:33,952 --> 00:12:37,952
The suit I made with the previous
pattern didn't fit

220
00:12:37,952 --> 00:12:39,952
I got fat

221
00:12:41,952 --> 00:12:43,952
I ate too much Jiro

222
00:12:43,952 --> 00:12:46,952
I ate too much ramen Jiro and got fat

223
00:12:46,952 --> 00:12:48,952
There are many reasons

224
00:12:48,952 --> 00:12:50,952
Mr.Gayuki Ogata is a ramen Jiro

225
00:12:50,952 --> 00:12:52,952
Remember that

226
00:12:52,952 --> 00:12:54,952
I'm hungry

227
00:12:54,952 --> 00:12:56,952
Everyone, listen

228
00:12:56,952 --> 00:12:58,952
Everyone, focus

229
00:12:58,952 --> 00:13:01,952
Listen, you may be hungry but please be
patient

230
00:13:01,952 --> 00:13:03,952
The last question

231
00:13:03,952 --> 00:13:05,952
After this, it's dinner

232
00:13:08,952 --> 00:13:10,952
Sorry, it's not good to be more popular
than the quiz

233
00:13:10,952 --> 00:13:12,952
Mr. Ramen

234
00:13:12,952 --> 00:13:14,952
Mr. Ramen

235
00:13:14,952 --> 00:13:16,952
Everyone, focus

236
00:13:16,952 --> 00:13:19,898
Wait a minute

237
00:13:19,898 --> 00:13:22,898
The last question

238
00:13:22,898 --> 00:13:27,898
What is Taiki Ogata's recent problem?

239
00:13:27,898 --> 00:13:28,898
Anyone who knows?

240
00:13:28,898 --> 00:13:32,898
Mayama is going crazy

241
00:13:32,898 --> 00:13:33,898
Mayama

242
00:13:33,898 --> 00:13:36,898
Honestly, I don't know what the lock is

243
00:13:36,898 --> 00:13:39,856
Thank you for watching

244
00:13:39,856 --> 00:13:42,856
It's true that he seems to be a little
lost

245
00:13:42,856 --> 00:13:45,856
But it's okay because it's rock

246
00:13:45,856 --> 00:13:48,856
But it's okay, I'm not shaking

247
00:13:48,856 --> 00:13:50,856
I'm worried about the microphone

248
00:13:50,856 --> 00:13:52,856
It's fine

249
00:13:52,856 --> 00:13:55,856
I'm worried about the microphone
position, but it's not

250
00:13:55,856 --> 00:13:56,856
Hint

251
00:13:56,856 --> 00:13:59,856
The hint is that I'm the eldest son

252
00:13:59,856 --> 00:14:01,856
Yes

253
00:14:02,856 --> 00:14:04,856
I'm the eldest son

254
00:14:04,856 --> 00:14:05,856
I got it

255
00:14:05,856 --> 00:14:08,856
Wait a minute, let's go to Hirota

256
00:14:08,856 --> 00:14:11,856
Hirota is not aware of it

257
00:14:11,856 --> 00:14:14,856
I'm sorry I couldn't understand

258
00:14:14,856 --> 00:14:23,856
I have to take care of my parents

259
00:14:23,856 --> 00:14:27,066
Correct

260
00:14:27,066 --> 00:14:32,066
To be exact, she is worried about her
parents' old age

261
00:14:32,066 --> 00:14:36,066
She is living with her parents in
Hokkaido

262
00:14:36,066 --> 00:14:42,066
I think everyone has the same problem

263
00:14:42,066 --> 00:14:50,066
After the final question, Hirota,
Kobayashi, Matsuno, and Yasumoto are
side by side with each point

264
00:14:50,066 --> 00:14:55,760
They decide to win by rock music

265
00:14:55,760 --> 00:14:57,760
Answer me!

266
00:15:00,760 --> 00:15:03,760
Matsuno's rock music

267
00:15:03,760 --> 00:15:05,760
But before that

268
00:15:05,760 --> 00:15:11,674
Shrimp Chuu Game Quest

269
00:15:11,674 --> 00:15:16,674
The Ebitune members who got lost in the
world of games last week

270
00:15:16,674 --> 00:15:20,674
The game making project is progressing!

271
00:15:20,674 --> 00:15:24,674
The Ebitune game project that was
suddenly announced

272
00:15:24,674 --> 00:15:28,674
What is the fate that awaits them?

273
00:15:30,674 --> 00:15:32,674
There's nothing again

274
00:15:32,674 --> 00:15:34,674
I'm scared of this

275
00:15:34,674 --> 00:15:36,736
The Ebitune game project is progressing!

276
00:15:36,736 --> 00:15:38,736
There's really nothing here.

277
00:15:38,736 --> 00:15:40,736
There's something else in here.

278
00:15:40,736 --> 00:15:42,736
Can I open it?

279
00:15:42,736 --> 00:15:44,736
What are you up to?

280
00:15:53,722 --> 00:16:00,722
Before we start the game, we will be the
players and aim for a level up.

281
00:16:00,722 --> 00:16:04,722
We will have weapons under the desk.
Choose your favorite weapon.

282
00:16:04,722 --> 00:16:06,722
We have a weapon!

283
00:16:06,722 --> 00:16:08,722
We will do this.

284
00:16:08,722 --> 00:16:10,722
Let's do this.

285
00:16:10,722 --> 00:16:12,722
Let's do this.

286
00:16:17,722 --> 00:16:18,722
How is it?

287
00:16:18,722 --> 00:16:19,952
Good.

288
00:16:19,952 --> 00:16:21,952
What is this?

289
00:16:21,952 --> 00:16:23,952
It's okay.

290
00:16:23,952 --> 00:16:25,952
When I took it, I was surprised.

291
00:16:25,952 --> 00:16:27,952
There is a lot.

292
00:16:27,952 --> 00:16:30,640
It's okay.

293
00:16:30,640 --> 00:16:32,640
・・・

294
00:16:32,640 --> 00:16:34,640
What?

295
00:16:34,640 --> 00:16:36,640
The letter was under the hand.

296
00:16:40,640 --> 00:16:44,640
To level up, experience the game all
over the world.

297
00:16:44,640 --> 00:16:46,640
Today's game is Jenga.

298
00:16:46,640 --> 00:16:48,640
Yay!

299
00:16:48,640 --> 00:16:50,640
I like Jenga.

300
00:16:50,640 --> 00:16:52,640
To the losing member, 〇〇.

301
00:16:52,640 --> 00:16:54,640
It's a game that's not good.

302
00:16:54,640 --> 00:16:56,640
I did it.

303
00:16:56,640 --> 00:16:58,640
I know.

304
00:16:58,640 --> 00:17:00,640
It's hard.

305
00:17:00,640 --> 00:17:02,640
I have to use a different imagination.

306
00:17:02,640 --> 00:17:04,640
Sour soup.

307
00:17:04,640 --> 00:17:06,640
Sour soup.

308
00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:10,640
Let's start the Jenga challenge.

309
00:17:12,640 --> 00:17:14,640
I've never seen anyone who's like that.

310
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:16,640
Is there anything you can do?

311
00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:18,640
That's the kind of person.

312
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:20,640
That's the kind of person.

313
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:22,640
Isn't this forever?

314
00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:24,640
I got it.

315
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:26,640
It's fun.

316
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:28,640
That's the kind of person.

317
00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:32,640
I'm going to fail.

318
00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:34,640
Don't do it.

319
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:36,640
Don't do it.

320
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:38,640
Don't do it.

321
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:40,640
It's different from the first time.

322
00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:42,640
Only when you're in a hurry.

323
00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:44,640
I'm about to fall.

324
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:46,640
Oh, my God.

325
00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:48,640
Oh, my God.

326
00:17:48,640 --> 00:17:50,586
Oh, my God.

327
00:17:50,586 --> 00:17:54,586
Try smelling it.

328
00:17:54,586 --> 00:17:56,586
Oh no, it stinks.

329
00:17:56,586 --> 00:17:58,586
It smells like a wooden person.

330
00:17:58,586 --> 00:18:00,586
It smells like a wooden person.

331
00:18:00,586 --> 00:18:02,586
Ready, set...

332
00:18:04,586 --> 00:18:06,586
It stinks.

333
00:18:06,586 --> 00:18:08,586
It stinks.

334
00:18:08,586 --> 00:18:10,586
It stinks.

335
00:18:10,586 --> 00:18:14,896
It stinks.

336
00:18:14,896 --> 00:18:17,896
The game project is in progress.

337
00:18:17,896 --> 00:18:23,872
The journey of a dangerous adventure
continues.

338
00:18:23,872 --> 00:18:30,872
The Kayaoshi switch quiz is a
combination of Hirota, Kobayashi and
Matsuno Yasumoto.

339
00:18:30,872 --> 00:18:34,872
The winner will be decided by a rock
song.

340
00:18:34,872 --> 00:18:36,872
The winner will be decided by a rock
song.

341
00:18:36,872 --> 00:18:39,872
The winner will be decided by a rock
song.

342
00:18:39,872 --> 00:18:46,872
Please show us a rock song.

343
00:18:46,872 --> 00:18:53,600
Rock'n'Roller, Kaiki Ogata's Rockin'
Word.

344
00:18:53,600 --> 00:18:57,600
I'll give you a love that will entangle
you.

345
00:18:58,600 --> 00:19:00,600
Thank you very much.

346
00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:04,600
As I said before, I don't use a
microphone.

347
00:19:05,600 --> 00:19:07,600
I'm in front of the microphone.

348
00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:14,064
Hirota Aika's Rockin' Word.

349
00:19:14,064 --> 00:19:25,064
I'm a professional's daughter, so I have
a plus and minus driver everyday, so
this quiz was easy.

350
00:19:26,064 --> 00:19:29,064
It was a speech, wasn't it? Thank you
very much.

351
00:19:30,064 --> 00:19:32,064
It's a word of Rock.

352
00:19:33,064 --> 00:19:35,064
But that was Hirota's Rock.

353
00:19:36,064 --> 00:19:37,064
Don't deny it.

354
00:19:38,064 --> 00:19:39,064
Don't deny it.

355
00:19:40,064 --> 00:19:41,064
What is it?

356
00:19:41,064 --> 00:19:44,064
If you're still angry with the rock,
turn on the light.

357
00:19:45,456 --> 00:19:52,056
Hirota's Talk's Talk Doofy Squ item will
light the switch for Foxy Way.

358
00:19:53,008 --> 00:19:55,008
Next, Matsuno.

359
00:19:55,008 --> 00:19:57,008
Gundam.

360
00:19:57,008 --> 00:19:59,008
Did you just say Gundam?

361
00:19:59,008 --> 00:20:01,008
She's right next to you.

362
00:20:03,008 --> 00:20:08,008
Matsuno Rina plus a rockin' line is...

363
00:20:08,008 --> 00:20:14,008
I went to Hawaii and bought a bottle of
water.

364
00:20:16,008 --> 00:20:18,008
That was pretty rockin'.

365
00:20:18,008 --> 00:20:20,008
You crossed the border.

366
00:20:20,008 --> 00:20:23,008
She's got a rockin' way of holding it.

367
00:20:23,008 --> 00:20:25,008
She's got a better style than me.

368
00:20:25,008 --> 00:20:29,008
Matsuno plus a rockin' line is...

369
00:20:29,008 --> 00:20:32,008
Miso Ramen Company!

Stand microphone is heavy

378
00:20:59,448 --> 00:21:03,448
Kobayashi plus a rock word is

379
00:21:03,448 --> 00:21:05,824

I'm nervous today

To be honest, I'm jealous of the adults
I haven't seen in a long time

385
00:21:26,624 --> 00:21:29,624
It's a cry of heart. It's wonderful.

386
00:21:29,624 --> 00:21:31,624
There are many adults I don't know.

387
00:21:31,624 --> 00:21:36,624
We were nervous when we met after a long
time.

388
00:21:36,624 --> 00:21:38,624
I said yes.

389
00:21:38,624 --> 00:21:39,624
Why?

390
00:21:39,624 --> 00:21:40,624
Something

391
00:21:40,624 --> 00:21:41,624
Why?

392
00:21:41,624 --> 00:21:43,624
Something is the most ideal.

00:22:02,264 --> 00:22:10,144
Please give a rock word of Daibakushou.

00:22:10,144 --> 00:22:13,644
Turn the earth upside down.

399
00:22:13,644 --> 00:22:18,144
Turn the earth upside down.

400
00:22:18,144 --> 00:22:20,144
How is it?

401
00:22:20,144 --> 00:22:22,144
It's a world, isn't it?

402
00:22:23,144 --> 00:22:26,144
Please give a rock word of Daibakushou.

403
00:22:26,144 --> 00:22:28,144
It's not the one I just did.

404
00:22:28,144 --> 00:22:29,144
I got it.

405
00:22:29,144 --> 00:22:30,144
Did you get it, Chie-san?

406
00:22:30,144 --> 00:22:31,144
Yes, I got it.

407
00:22:31,144 --> 00:22:32,144
Please do it.

408
00:22:32,144 --> 00:22:33,144
I didn't get it.

409
00:22:33,144 --> 00:22:34,144
Please do it.

I want to decide the best of rock among
these

417
00:22:59,792 --> 00:23:01,792
The winner is the person who will decide

418
00:23:01,792 --> 00:23:03,792
I can feel it

419
00:23:03,792 --> 00:23:07,792
There is a person who showed the rock
side

420
00:23:07,792 --> 00:23:08,792
Ok, Okatsu-san

Yasumoto-san, why?

426
00:23:21,720 --> 00:23:29,720
I think it's rock music that reveals his
weakness and trauma

427
00:23:29,720 --> 00:23:31,720
It's definitely a rock song

428
00:23:31,720 --> 00:23:34,720
Yasumoto-san, congratulations on winning
the award

429
00:23:36,720 --> 00:23:42,720
Yasumoto-san, this is a gift for you

430
00:23:42,720 --> 00:23:44,720
Can I press this?

431
00:23:44,720 --> 00:23:48,720
Let's give it to the camera

432
00:23:50,970 --> 00:23:52,970
It's surprisingly hard

433
00:23:54,970 --> 00:23:55,970
Thank you very much

434
00:23:55,970 --> 00:23:58,970

I asked the president of Fujii about the
response

444
00:24:43,552 --> 00:24:47,552
I felt that he was more than I thought

445
00:24:47,552 --> 00:24:50,552
More than you thought?

446
00:24:50,552 --> 00:24:55,552
Furthermore, when I asked what kind of
girl he wanted

447
00:24:55,552 --> 00:24:58,552
I want a positive girl like Shigeo
Nagashima

448
00:24:58,552 --> 00:25:04,464

MC Kobayashi is very popular.

456
00:25:23,464 --> 00:25:24,464
And more.

457
00:25:24,464 --> 00:25:26,464
Hello.

458
00:25:27,864 --> 00:25:29,864
