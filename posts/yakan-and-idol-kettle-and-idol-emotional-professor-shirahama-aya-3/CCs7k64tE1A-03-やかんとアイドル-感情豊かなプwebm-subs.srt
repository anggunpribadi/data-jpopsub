1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
It's hot!

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,000
I'm going to fall in love with the night
view!

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:10,000
The night view is the best!

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:11,802
Please subscribe to my channel!

5
00:00:11,802 --> 00:00:15,402
What is the element of Shirahama-san?

6
00:00:15,402 --> 00:00:17,488
Do you want to read it yourself?

7
00:00:17,488 --> 00:00:20,828
The second factor is the game!

8
00:00:20,828 --> 00:00:22,828
Kachikachikachii!

9
00:00:22,828 --> 00:00:24,828
Ah, sorry. Kachikachikachii, are you
okay?

10
00:00:24,828 --> 00:00:25,828
I made a mistake.

11
00:00:25,828 --> 00:00:26,828
That's right.

12
00:00:26,828 --> 00:00:28,828
I'm playing a game.

13
00:00:28,828 --> 00:00:33,328
I'm quite into games, like Switch.

14
00:00:33,328 --> 00:00:36,828
I've been playing DS since I was a kid.

15
00:00:36,828 --> 00:00:37,828
You know DS?

16
00:00:37,828 --> 00:00:38,828
I know.

17
00:00:38,828 --> 00:00:39,828
I have a sister.

18
00:00:39,828 --> 00:00:42,828
I'm playing DS with my sister.

19
00:00:42,828 --> 00:00:46,828
I was having fun with each of them and
communicating with them.

20
00:00:46,828 --> 00:00:51,828
I've been playing games since I was a
kid.

21
00:00:51,828 --> 00:00:55,828
I'm into Splatoon these days.

22
00:00:55,828 --> 00:00:56,828
Yes, yes.

23
00:00:56,828 --> 00:00:59,828
But now there's a 3.

24
00:00:59,828 --> 00:01:04,828
I don't have the courage to buy a 3.

25
00:01:04,828 --> 00:01:06,828
You're brave.

26
00:01:06,828 --> 00:01:07,828
You're brave.

27
00:01:07,828 --> 00:01:09,828
I'm saving money.

28
00:01:09,828 --> 00:01:12,828
I don't have the courage to buy a 3.

29
00:01:12,828 --> 00:01:17,828
But when I saw the ads,

30
00:01:17,828 --> 00:01:26,828
Splatoon 2 and 3 have been evolving a
lot.

31
00:01:26,828 --> 00:01:33,828
I thought I'd buy it if I heard about
Splatoon 3.

32
00:01:33,828 --> 00:01:37,828
I'm thinking of buying it on Christmas
in December.

33
00:01:37,828 --> 00:01:38,828
I see.

34
00:01:38,828 --> 00:01:39,828
Do you have a 2?

35
00:01:39,828 --> 00:01:42,828
Yes, I'm really into Splatoon 2 now.

36
00:01:42,828 --> 00:01:43,828
Really?

37
00:01:43,828 --> 00:01:44,828
Yes.

38
00:01:44,828 --> 00:01:47,828
But everyone goes to Splatoon 3.

39
00:01:47,828 --> 00:01:49,828
Is that true?

40
00:01:49,828 --> 00:01:53,828
But I don't have any Splatoon friends.

41
00:01:53,828 --> 00:01:55,828
You don't have any Splatoon friends?

42
00:01:55,828 --> 00:01:56,828
Yes.

43
00:01:56,828 --> 00:02:00,828
I'm sorry. I forgot.

44
00:02:00,828 --> 00:02:01,828
Who is it?

45
00:02:01,828 --> 00:02:02,828
I want to ask you.

46
00:02:02,828 --> 00:02:04,848
I want to ask you.

47
00:02:04,848 --> 00:02:06,848
Who forgot about you?

48
00:02:06,848 --> 00:02:08,848
I forgot about the member Aoyama.

49
00:02:08,848 --> 00:02:10,848
I'm sorry.

50
00:02:10,848 --> 00:02:12,848
That's good.

51
00:02:12,848 --> 00:02:14,848
I said I don't have a friend.

52
00:02:14,848 --> 00:02:16,848
But

53
00:02:16,848 --> 00:02:18,848
It's been 3 years.

54
00:02:18,848 --> 00:02:20,848
NANO-chan

55
00:02:20,848 --> 00:02:22,848
Before I joined BOLT

56
00:02:22,848 --> 00:02:24,848
She was my best friend.

57
00:02:24,848 --> 00:02:26,848
We were good friends.

58
00:02:26,848 --> 00:02:28,848
We played games together.

59
00:02:28,848 --> 00:02:30,848
We played games together.

60
00:02:30,848 --> 00:02:32,848
We played Splatoon together.

61
00:02:32,848 --> 00:02:34,848
We played Splatoon together.

62
00:02:34,848 --> 00:02:36,848
We played recently.

63
00:02:36,848 --> 00:02:38,848
We played together for 3 years

64
00:02:38,848 --> 00:02:40,848
We played together for 3 years

65
00:02:40,848 --> 00:02:42,848
The first round was on a ship.

66
00:02:42,848 --> 00:02:44,848
We played together on the ship.

67
00:02:44,848 --> 00:02:46,848
We were communicating with each other.

68
00:02:46,848 --> 00:02:48,848
3 years ago

69
00:02:48,848 --> 00:02:50,848
I had just started playing

70
00:02:50,848 --> 00:02:52,848
I had just started playing

71
00:02:52,848 --> 00:02:54,848
We lost in the game.

72
00:02:54,848 --> 00:02:56,848
We lost in the game.

73
00:02:56,848 --> 00:02:58,848
Now I'm in the opposite.

74
00:02:58,848 --> 00:03:00,848
I won several times

75
00:03:00,848 --> 00:03:04,848
I won the game and I was so frustrated.

76
00:03:04,848 --> 00:03:07,848
I was like, let's do it again.

77
00:03:07,848 --> 00:03:08,848
I see.

78
00:03:08,848 --> 00:03:14,848
You won the game and forgot that you
were a friend.

79
00:03:14,848 --> 00:03:20,048
I'm sorry.

80
00:03:20,048 --> 00:03:22,048
What do you do when you're bored?

81
00:03:22,048 --> 00:03:28,048
I do almost everything for my friend,
Nanaha Aoyama.

82
00:03:28,048 --> 00:03:30,048
What do you do when you're bored?

83
00:03:30,048 --> 00:03:34,048
What do you do when you're bored?

84
00:03:34,048 --> 00:03:37,048
This program is provided by

85
00:03:37,048 --> 00:03:40,048
Maki

86
00:03:40,048 --> 00:03:43,888
Aoyama

87
00:03:43,888 --> 00:03:45,888
Korari Kashishi

88
00:03:46,888 --> 00:03:48,888
Chabu

89
00:03:49,888 --> 00:03:52,888
These are the gifts I have for you.

90
00:03:55,888 --> 00:03:58,888
Please come to the live show of Bolt
again!

91
00:03:58,888 --> 00:04:04,541
Thank you!
