00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,680
Hello, everyone. I'm Mayuka Sasaki from
Pico-All-Ram.

2
00:00:02,680 --> 00:00:03,680
I'm Anna Yamamoto.

3
00:00:03,680 --> 00:00:08,080
Today, we're going to introduce what we
bought at Costco.

4
00:00:08,080 --> 00:00:09,680
Yay!

5
00:00:09,680 --> 00:00:10,680
I wanted to go!

6
00:00:10,680 --> 00:00:13,800
We finally went to Costco.

7
00:00:13,800 --> 00:00:15,440
It's been about three years.

8
00:00:15,440 --> 00:00:17,760
We've been saying it for a long time.

9
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:19,080
Finally!

10
00:00:19,880 --> 00:00:21,080
I'm really looking forward to it.

11
00:00:21,080 --> 00:00:21,720
I'm happy.

12
00:00:21,720 --> 00:00:22,640
Are you looking forward to it?

13
00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:23,560
I'm looking forward to it.

14
00:00:23,560 --> 00:00:25,040
Thank you. I'm looking forward to it.

15
00:00:25,040 --> 00:00:26,960
I'd like to introduce it right away.

16
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:28,920
What I bought this time is...

17
00:00:28,920 --> 00:00:30,160
Ta-da!

18
00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:31,960
Yay!

19
00:00:31,960 --> 00:00:32,800
Can you see it?

20
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:33,400
I can't see it.

21
00:00:33,400 --> 00:00:34,400
Jaguar...

22
00:00:34,400 --> 00:00:35,240
Can you see it?

23
00:00:35,240 --> 00:00:36,320
Come here.

24
00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:37,760
I saw it.

25
00:00:37,760 --> 00:00:38,520
That's crazy.

26
00:00:38,520 --> 00:00:39,200
That's crazy. Look.

27
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:40,120
That's amazing. Look.

28
00:00:40,120 --> 00:00:41,240
There's more behind you.

29
00:00:41,240 --> 00:00:41,960
Wow!

30
00:00:41,960 --> 00:00:42,680
Oh, it's not over there.

31
00:00:42,680 --> 00:00:43,720
That's amazing.

32
00:00:43,720 --> 00:00:45,160
I really bought too much.

33
00:00:45,160 --> 00:00:46,160
I bought too much.

34
00:00:46,160 --> 00:00:49,240
I'd like to introduce what I bought at
Costco.

35
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:50,720
First of all, here.

36
00:00:50,720 --> 00:00:51,200
Yes.

37
00:00:51,200 --> 00:00:52,120
Jagariko.

38
00:00:52,120 --> 00:00:53,120
Jagariko.

39
00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:55,440
I bought it.

40
00:00:55,440 --> 00:00:58,200
I love Jagariko as a snack.

41
00:00:58,200 --> 00:00:59,560
I love IKORABU.

42
00:00:59,560 --> 00:01:02,360
I like the salad flavor the most.

43
00:01:02,360 --> 00:01:03,960
Well, it's a salad.

44
00:01:03,960 --> 00:01:06,240
It's zero calories.

45
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:08,560
There are 12 of them.

46
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:09,520
Wow, that's great.

47
00:01:09,520 --> 00:01:11,000
I'll give it to everyone.

48
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:14,200
The Jagariko who hides my face is...

49
00:01:14,200 --> 00:01:14,640
Yes.

50
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:15,920
Goodbye.

51
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:16,720
What's next?

52
00:01:16,720 --> 00:01:18,080
This is...

53
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:19,960
Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhh!

54
00:01:19,960 --> 00:01:21,400
Hahaha.

55
00:01:21,400 --> 00:01:22,720
That happens sometimes.

56
00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:23,680
The cheese is...

57
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:25,440
The cheese is falling apart.

58
00:01:25,440 --> 00:01:27,600
Thank you very much.

59
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:30,000
This is yogurt.

60
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,080
It's Chichias yogurt.

61
00:01:32,080 --> 00:01:34,160
What do you think this is?

62
00:01:34,160 --> 00:01:35,960
It says Setouchi.

63
00:01:35,960 --> 00:01:36,520
Sharp.

64
00:01:36,520 --> 00:01:37,800
Where is Setouchi?

65
00:01:37,800 --> 00:01:39,200
What?

66
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:39,800
What?

67
00:01:39,800 --> 00:01:40,640
What does that mean?

68
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:41,240
It's Hiroshima.

69
00:01:41,240 --> 00:01:43,040
Yes, that's right.

70
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:46,000
I've been eating this since I was a kid.

71
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,960
Have you seen this girl?

72
00:01:47,960 --> 00:01:48,600
Chibou?

73
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:49,320
Not a girl.

74
00:01:49,320 --> 00:01:49,680
Chibou.

75
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:50,440
Is this a girl?

76
00:01:50,440 --> 00:01:51,240
Is it a boy?

77
00:01:51,240 --> 00:01:52,600
It's Chibou, so it's a boy.

78
00:01:52,600 --> 00:01:53,000
Yes.

79
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:54,200
There are three flavors.

80
00:01:54,200 --> 00:01:55,160
That's nice.

81
00:01:55,160 --> 00:01:56,560
It's a little different.

82
00:01:56,560 --> 00:01:59,280
You eat yogurt in the morning.

83
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:02,040
People still think you're Hiroshima
Yunka.

84
00:02:02,040 --> 00:02:05,840
I wanted to feel Hiroshima, so I chose
this.

85
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:08,560
This is also quite heavy.

86
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:09,360
What's next?

87
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:10,840
This is...

88
00:02:10,840 --> 00:02:11,720
Ta-da!

89
00:02:11,720 --> 00:02:13,160
It looks heavy.

90
00:02:13,160 --> 00:02:14,080
It looks delicious.

91
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:14,960
Richam.

92
00:02:14,960 --> 00:02:15,960
Is it called Richam?

93
00:02:15,960 --> 00:02:18,080
Yes, it's like Spam.

94
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:19,080
It's not Spam.

95
00:02:19,080 --> 00:02:19,800
It's not Spam.

96
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:20,760
It's Richam.

97
00:02:20,760 --> 00:02:21,840
What is this?

98
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:23,560
You bought it.

99
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:25,960
I wanted to eat Spam.

100
00:02:25,960 --> 00:02:28,720
I put Spam in it once.

101
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:31,960
I thought it was healthier.

102
00:02:31,960 --> 00:02:32,840
So I chose this.

103
00:02:32,840 --> 00:02:33,760
It looks delicious.

104
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:34,480
A lot.

105
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:35,360
This is also a dumbbell.

106
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:37,520
Great.

107
00:02:37,520 --> 00:02:39,120
This is also a dumbbell.

108
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:40,480
It's really heavy.

109
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:43,080
It's delicious if you eat it with
mozzarella cheese.

110
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:44,000
It's definitely delicious.

111
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,080
I love this.

112
00:02:45,080 --> 00:02:46,800
Great.

113
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:47,440
Next.

114
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:49,400
I don't think this will end.

115
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:50,680
I'll eat it quickly.

116
00:02:50,680 --> 00:02:52,760
This is the one I dropped earlier.

117
00:02:52,760 --> 00:02:57,520
This is the pizza that I dropped.

118
00:02:57,520 --> 00:03:00,520
This is a dream.

119
00:03:00,520 --> 00:03:02,080
I want to eat this alone.

120
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:04,160
I want to eat this alone.

121
00:03:04,160 --> 00:03:05,000
I can do it with a watch.

122
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,720
You are wonderful.

123
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:08,840
You are sloppy.

124
00:03:08,840 --> 00:03:10,760
Next is this.

125
00:03:10,760 --> 00:03:12,440
I've always wanted this.

126
00:03:12,440 --> 00:03:13,600
This is strawberry milk.

127
00:03:13,600 --> 00:03:14,560
This looks delicious.

128
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:15,720
This is popular.

129
00:03:15,720 --> 00:03:16,880
Is this popular?

130
00:03:16,880 --> 00:03:18,120
I've seen it before.

131
00:03:18,120 --> 00:03:20,120
I love strawberry milk.

132
00:03:20,120 --> 00:03:22,600
I like strawberry-flavored strawberry
milk.

133
00:03:22,600 --> 00:03:24,120
This is the best.

134
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:27,160
You can adjust the concentration of your
own.

135
00:03:27,160 --> 00:03:28,480
Next is this.

136
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:30,120
This is a cheese.

137
00:03:30,120 --> 00:03:32,360
I eat a lot of cheese.

138
00:03:32,360 --> 00:03:34,520
This is burrata cheese.

139
00:03:34,520 --> 00:03:36,360
I love this.

140
00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:42,240
I ate about 10 of this this summer.

141
00:03:42,240 --> 00:03:43,840
I think I eat a lot.

142
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:45,960
I love this kind of cheese.

143
00:03:45,960 --> 00:03:47,640
The inside of this cheese is very soft.

144
00:03:47,640 --> 00:03:51,160
This is also mozzarella cheese.

145
00:03:51,160 --> 00:03:54,360
This is like raclette cheese.

146
00:03:54,360 --> 00:03:56,080
I love this.

147
00:03:56,080 --> 00:03:57,120
I love this.

148
00:03:57,120 --> 00:03:58,200
I eat this.

149
00:03:58,200 --> 00:04:00,880
I was caught.

150
00:04:00,880 --> 00:04:04,160
This is a cheese that you can put on top
of the cheese.

151
00:04:04,160 --> 00:04:05,760
I see.

152
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:07,920
This is the best.

153
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:10,720
I've always wanted to eat this.

154
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:11,840
This is a shell in.

155
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:12,960
What is that?

156
00:04:12,960 --> 00:04:16,560
This is a famous product in Costco.

157
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:18,640
This is a famous product.

158
00:04:18,640 --> 00:04:20,440
This is cream cheese.

159
00:04:20,440 --> 00:04:22,800
Everyone buys this.

160
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:25,640
I haven't eaten the purchased video.

161
00:04:25,640 --> 00:04:26,680
Did you eat it?

162
00:04:26,680 --> 00:04:27,680
I ate it.

163
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:29,000
This is delicious.

164
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:29,880
Thank you.

165
00:04:29,880 --> 00:04:34,200
I like watching the purchased video of
Costco.

166
00:04:34,200 --> 00:04:36,760
This is a basic product.

167
00:04:36,760 --> 00:04:38,240
I want to eat this all the time.

168
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:38,840
I want to eat this.

169
00:04:38,840 --> 00:04:40,040
Let's eat this later.

170
00:04:40,040 --> 00:04:41,200
What is this?

171
00:04:41,200 --> 00:04:42,640
This is this.

172
00:04:42,640 --> 00:04:44,120
This is a croissant.

173
00:04:44,120 --> 00:04:46,600
This is a croissant.

174
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:48,840
I love croissants.

175
00:04:48,840 --> 00:04:50,600
This is like a bread in Costco.

176
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:51,800
This is very cute.

177
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:52,640
This is a lot.

178
00:04:52,640 --> 00:04:54,080
This is the back.

179
00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:55,440
I don't have anyone to show me the back.

180
00:04:55,440 --> 00:04:56,800
This is good.

181
00:04:56,800 --> 00:04:57,600
This is good on the outside.

182
00:04:57,600 --> 00:04:58,440
This is cute on the back.

183
00:04:58,440 --> 00:05:00,560
This is good on the outside.

184
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:02,000
I wanted to eat croissants.

185
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,960
Please put a black croissant on it.

186
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:06,440
This is a black croissant.

187
00:05:06,440 --> 00:05:08,440
This is a black croissant.

188
00:05:08,440 --> 00:05:10,120
I bought this because I wanted to eat
it.

189
00:05:10,120 --> 00:05:12,400
This looks delicious.

190
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:14,240
Please call this a croissant.

191
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:15,680
I understand.

192
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:17,800
This is still in the back.

193
00:05:17,800 --> 00:05:19,360
This is cold.

194
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:20,360
What is this?

195
00:05:20,360 --> 00:05:22,600
This is a mixed fruit.

196
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:24,600
This looks healthy.

197
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:28,480
This is a strawberry, pineapple, red
grape and peach.

198
00:05:28,480 --> 00:05:29,040
This looks delicious.

199
00:05:29,040 --> 00:05:30,800
This is cold.

200
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:31,640
This is cold.

201
00:05:31,640 --> 00:05:34,080
This is a great frozen product.

202
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:35,200
This is great.

203
00:05:35,200 --> 00:05:35,760
This is convenient.

204
00:05:35,760 --> 00:05:37,760
And this is a light color.

205
00:05:37,760 --> 00:05:40,080
This is heavy.

206
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:44,280
This is like a grapefruit.

207
00:05:44,280 --> 00:05:47,880
This is also a product introduction of
COSTCO.

208
00:05:47,880 --> 00:05:48,680
I see.

209
00:05:48,680 --> 00:05:50,560
You are very interested in COSTCO.

210
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:53,560
I don't write in Japanese.

211
00:05:53,560 --> 00:05:55,440
This is also a product with 12 items.

212
00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:56,720
This is a product that everyone eats.

213
00:05:56,720 --> 00:05:58,680
I like you.

214
00:05:58,680 --> 00:06:00,480
I like you very much.

215
00:06:00,480 --> 00:06:04,160
This is a mashed potato.

216
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:06,400
I like mashed potatoes.

217
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:08,400
What is this?

218
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:10,360
This is a powder.

219
00:06:10,360 --> 00:06:11,160
This is a powder.

220
00:06:11,160 --> 00:06:14,440
This is a powder that is mixed with
milk.

221
00:06:14,440 --> 00:06:17,720
This is a powder that is mixed with milk
and fried in a frying pan.

222
00:06:17,720 --> 00:06:19,560
This is English.

223
00:06:19,560 --> 00:06:22,120
This is an English manual.

224
00:06:22,120 --> 00:06:24,800
You do your best.

225
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:27,160
I will do my best.

226
00:06:27,160 --> 00:06:28,600
Yes.

227
00:06:28,600 --> 00:06:30,560
You bought this.

228
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:31,280
Is that so?

229
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:32,120
Yes.

230
00:06:32,120 --> 00:06:33,680
I also put this in.

231
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:34,440
Did you put this in?

232
00:06:34,440 --> 00:06:35,440
Yes.

233
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:36,880
This is a seaweed flake.

234
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:38,880
This is delicious.

235
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:43,360
I took a video of BEEF SHELL FISH in
Korea.

236
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:47,080
At that time, the food was spicy.

237
00:06:47,080 --> 00:06:50,960
But I ate only rice and seaweed flake.

238
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:52,760
This is delicious.

239
00:06:52,760 --> 00:06:54,040
I love this.

240
00:06:54,040 --> 00:06:55,240
I can eat this forever.

241
00:06:55,240 --> 00:06:56,840
This is a product that disappears
quickly.

242
00:06:56,840 --> 00:06:59,600
This is the best.

243
00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:02,960
And this is a mango.

244
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:05,080
I thought this was a mango.

245
00:07:05,080 --> 00:07:08,080
This is a mango.

246
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:09,440
This is a mango.

247
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:10,560
Call it a bear.

248
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:12,440
I bought a mango.

249
00:07:12,440 --> 00:07:15,840
I have always liked mangoes.

250
00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:17,560
You bought this after you went to
OKINAWA.

251
00:07:17,560 --> 00:07:18,520
No, I bought this before that.

252
00:07:18,520 --> 00:07:19,520
I bought this when I was in AKADAKE.

253
00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:20,840
Is that so?

254
00:07:20,840 --> 00:07:23,880
AKADAKE was 4 or 5 years ago.

255
00:07:23,880 --> 00:07:25,680
So I bought a mango.

256
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:27,000
This is a mango.

257
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:30,080
I am happy to have this much.

258
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:32,800
This is me.

259
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:36,960
I eat hot pot every day in winter.

260
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:38,480
I have the image of eating this often.

261
00:07:38,480 --> 00:07:39,320
Yes.

262
00:07:39,320 --> 00:07:41,080
This is delicious.

263
00:07:41,080 --> 00:07:43,600
I can eat this hot pot.

264
00:07:43,600 --> 00:07:47,280
This is an everyday hot pot.

265
00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:49,880
I eat this.

266
00:07:49,880 --> 00:07:51,720
This is getting more and more.

267
00:07:51,720 --> 00:07:54,320
This is amazing.

268
00:07:54,320 --> 00:07:56,000
This is amazing.

269
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,800
What do you think this is?

270
00:07:57,800 --> 00:07:59,520
I already know.

271
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:02,240
This is written on the package.

272
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:06,160
This is a pillow.

273
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:07,560
I bought this.

274
00:08:07,560 --> 00:08:11,040
I made a mistake and fell asleep.

275
00:08:11,040 --> 00:08:12,040
I'm happy.

276
00:08:12,040 --> 00:08:13,680
This is the case.

277
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:16,640
There is no one who loves pillows.

278
00:08:16,640 --> 00:08:18,800
This is a pillow that breaks.

279
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:21,640
You will sleep with this from today.

280
00:08:21,640 --> 00:08:24,320
Don't get your neck wrong.

281
00:08:24,320 --> 00:08:29,360
This is ASMR.

282
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:31,440
I'm going to fall asleep.

283
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:33,200
Do that on the IKONOIJOI channel.

284
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:34,680
This is amazing.

285
00:08:34,680 --> 00:08:37,080
I didn't think this was so big.

286
00:08:37,080 --> 00:08:38,040
I want to eat this.

287
00:08:38,040 --> 00:08:39,280
This is amazing.

288
00:08:39,280 --> 00:08:40,400
This is big.

289
00:08:40,400 --> 00:08:44,840
This is amazing.

290
00:08:44,840 --> 00:08:46,560
I'm very funny today.

291
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:50,040
I have to be funny today.

292
00:08:50,040 --> 00:08:52,360
You are funny when you are here.

293
00:08:52,360 --> 00:08:53,880
Next.

294
00:08:53,880 --> 00:08:56,280
This is heavy.

295
00:08:56,280 --> 00:08:58,720
Is this heavy?

296
00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:02,720
This is also a dumbbell.

297
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:04,120
This is a mickey mouse.

298
00:09:04,120 --> 00:09:08,720
Everyone loves this.

299
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:12,520
This is a popular mickey mouse.

300
00:09:12,520 --> 00:09:14,560
This is a four-type ZAKURO.

301
00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:19,280
I think someone drank ZAKURO.

302
00:09:19,280 --> 00:09:21,520
I also had this at home.

303
00:09:21,520 --> 00:09:24,840
I was taught to drink this at first.

304
00:09:24,840 --> 00:09:28,680
I can drink various drinks from now on.

305
00:09:28,680 --> 00:09:29,800
You are carrying this.

306
00:09:29,800 --> 00:09:33,080
I'm cool.

307
00:09:33,080 --> 00:09:34,520
This is a smoothie.

308
00:09:34,520 --> 00:09:35,640
This is a candy.

309
00:09:35,640 --> 00:09:37,880
This is a bread.

310
00:09:37,880 --> 00:09:42,040
This is the last.

311
00:09:42,040 --> 00:09:43,760
This is the most exciting.

312
00:09:50,400 --> 00:09:52,440
I wanted both of these.

313
00:09:52,440 --> 00:09:53,800
This is cute.

314
00:09:53,800 --> 00:09:54,520
Is this cute?

315
00:09:54,520 --> 00:09:56,960
This is bread.

316
00:09:56,960 --> 00:09:58,040
This is the opposite.

317
00:10:00,400 --> 00:10:01,120
This is the best.

318
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:03,840
This is baked a little.

319
00:10:03,840 --> 00:10:05,400
This can be baked at home.

320
00:10:05,400 --> 00:10:06,480
This is the best.

321
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:08,640
I want to make bread.

322
00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:10,520
But this is difficult.

323
00:10:10,520 --> 00:10:11,800
This is difficult to knead.

324
00:10:11,800 --> 00:10:14,280
I want you to sell all of this.

325
00:10:14,280 --> 00:10:16,800
This can be stored in the freezer.

326
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:18,920
You don't have to eat all of this.

327
00:10:18,920 --> 00:10:20,760
This is half.

328
00:10:20,760 --> 00:10:21,480
This is the best.

329
00:10:21,480 --> 00:10:24,320
This is half.

330
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:26,280
Why do you say that?

331
00:10:26,280 --> 00:10:28,200
This is four.

332
00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:30,520
This is cute.

333
00:10:30,520 --> 00:10:34,920
Why do you show me the back?

334
00:10:34,920 --> 00:10:39,600
The back of the bread is cute.

335
00:10:40,600 --> 00:10:41,600
That's all.

336
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:44,600
Wow, a lot of food.

337
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:48,600
It's a party, so let's eat some.

338
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:50,600
What do you want to eat?

339
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:53,600
There are only a few things you can eat.

340
00:10:54,600 --> 00:10:55,600
I can't eat pizza.

341
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:56,600
Let's drink this.

342
00:10:57,600 --> 00:10:59,600
I bought milk at a convenience store
every time I drank this.

343
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:02,600
Great.

344
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:04,600
This is not Costco.

345
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:06,600
This is a convenience store.

346
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:08,600
Let's move on.

347
00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:13,600
Cheese is delicious.

348
00:11:14,600 --> 00:11:15,600
You are delicious.

349
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:17,600
You are delicious. I know.

350
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:21,114
Thank you.

351
00:11:21,114 --> 00:11:23,114
I want to eat this.

352
00:11:23,114 --> 00:11:24,114
This one too.

353
00:11:24,114 --> 00:11:26,114
I think I can eat this one and this one.

354
00:11:26,114 --> 00:11:27,114
Can I eat this?

355
00:11:27,114 --> 00:11:28,114
Sure.

356
00:11:28,114 --> 00:11:29,114
Eat, eat.

357
00:11:29,114 --> 00:11:30,114
Eat a lot.

358
00:11:31,114 --> 00:11:33,114
It's not good for the members.

359
00:11:33,114 --> 00:11:34,114
That's true.

360
00:11:35,114 --> 00:11:37,114
I've always wanted to see this.

361
00:11:37,114 --> 00:11:38,114
Is that the one you open with your
mouth?

362
00:11:38,114 --> 00:11:39,114
What?

363
00:11:39,114 --> 00:11:40,114
Switch-type gummy.

364
00:11:40,114 --> 00:11:41,114
Switch-type gummy?

365
00:11:42,114 --> 00:11:43,114
Switch-type gummy.

366
00:11:43,114 --> 00:11:45,114
Itadakimasu.

367
00:11:46,114 --> 00:11:47,114
What?

368
00:11:47,114 --> 00:11:48,114
What?

369
00:11:48,114 --> 00:11:48,848
What?

370
00:11:48,848 --> 00:11:49,848
It's good!

371
00:11:49,848 --> 00:11:52,848
It's good? I haven't eaten it yet.

372
00:11:52,848 --> 00:11:53,848
You're eating it first.

373
00:11:53,848 --> 00:11:54,848
I'm eating it first.

374
00:11:54,848 --> 00:11:56,848
Let's eat.

375
00:11:57,848 --> 00:11:59,848
It smells really good.

376
00:11:59,848 --> 00:12:00,848
It's good!

377
00:12:00,848 --> 00:12:01,848
It's amazing.

378
00:12:02,848 --> 00:12:03,848
It's good!

379
00:12:03,848 --> 00:12:04,848
What does it taste like?

380
00:12:04,848 --> 00:12:05,848
Cream cheese?

381
00:12:05,848 --> 00:12:06,848
It's written on it.

382
00:12:06,848 --> 00:12:07,848
Oh, I wrote it down.

383
00:12:08,848 --> 00:12:09,848
It's good!

384
00:12:09,848 --> 00:12:12,848
I want to eat it with a snack at 3
o'clock.

385
00:12:12,848 --> 00:12:15,848
I feel happy when I have this in the
refrigerator.

386
00:12:15,848 --> 00:12:16,848
There's a lot.

387
00:12:16,848 --> 00:12:17,848
It's the best.

388
00:12:17,848 --> 00:12:21,848
If I had this at home, I would eat it
all in a day.

389
00:12:21,848 --> 00:12:22,848
I agree.

390
00:12:22,848 --> 00:12:24,848
I want to drink it as it is.

391
00:12:24,848 --> 00:12:25,848
What if you drink it?

392
00:12:25,848 --> 00:12:26,848
Wait a minute.

393
00:12:26,848 --> 00:12:27,848
It's good!

394
00:12:27,848 --> 00:12:30,848
It's not a transparent container.

395
00:12:30,848 --> 00:12:31,848
It's not cute.

396
00:12:31,848 --> 00:12:33,848
I'm not going to eat it.

397
00:12:34,848 --> 00:12:36,848
We just drink it.

398
00:12:36,848 --> 00:12:38,848
I want to drink it regularly.

399
00:12:40,848 --> 00:12:41,848
Milk.

400
00:12:43,848 --> 00:12:44,848
I haven't seen it.

401
00:12:44,848 --> 00:12:45,848
It's okay.

402
00:12:45,848 --> 00:12:46,848
It's amazing.

403
00:12:46,848 --> 00:12:47,848
It looks delicious.

404
00:12:47,848 --> 00:12:48,848
Do you know what it is?

405
00:12:48,848 --> 00:12:49,848
It's a radish.

406
00:12:49,848 --> 00:12:53,848
I haven't eaten anything since this
morning because of the plan.

407
00:12:53,848 --> 00:12:56,848
I'm so hungry that I'm full of
motivation.

408
00:12:56,848 --> 00:12:59,152
Please subscribe to my channel.

409
00:13:00,152 --> 00:13:02,152
I think I put too much milk.

410
00:13:02,152 --> 00:13:04,152
Let's try it.

411
00:13:07,152 --> 00:13:09,152
Did you put too much milk?

412
00:13:09,152 --> 00:13:10,152
No.

413
00:13:10,152 --> 00:13:11,152
Really?

414
00:13:12,152 --> 00:13:13,152
I put too much.

415
00:13:15,152 --> 00:13:16,152
But it's delicious.

416
00:13:16,152 --> 00:13:17,152
It's delicious.

417
00:13:17,152 --> 00:13:19,152
Wait, it's almost gone.

418
00:13:19,152 --> 00:13:20,152
I think so.

419
00:13:21,152 --> 00:13:22,152
I should have ordered 100.

420
00:13:22,152 --> 00:13:24,152
I hope it's in the regular bottle.

421
00:13:24,152 --> 00:13:28,152
It's delicious.

422
00:13:28,634 --> 00:13:29,634
It's good.

423
00:13:29,634 --> 00:13:30,634
It's a good match.

424
00:13:30,634 --> 00:13:31,634
It's a good match.

425
00:13:32,634 --> 00:13:34,634
It's good to put cheese in it.

426
00:13:34,634 --> 00:13:35,634
You're a genius.

427
00:13:35,634 --> 00:13:36,634
Am I?

428
00:13:36,634 --> 00:13:38,634
I'll call you Dr.

429
00:13:38,634 --> 00:13:39,634
Call me Dr. Anna.

430
00:13:40,634 --> 00:13:41,634
Wow!

431
00:13:41,634 --> 00:13:42,634
Wow!

432
00:13:42,634 --> 00:13:43,634
It's great!

433
00:13:43,634 --> 00:13:44,634
It's great.

434
00:13:44,634 --> 00:13:45,634
It's shining.

435
00:13:45,634 --> 00:13:46,634
It's shining.

436
00:13:46,634 --> 00:13:47,634
It's the best.

437
00:13:47,634 --> 00:13:48,634
You're shining.

438
00:13:48,634 --> 00:13:49,634
It's good.

439
00:13:49,634 --> 00:13:50,634
It's good.

440
00:13:50,634 --> 00:13:51,634
So...

441
00:13:51,634 --> 00:13:54,480
I'll eat it.

442
00:13:55,480 --> 00:13:57,480
Wait, it's definitely delicious.

443
00:13:57,480 --> 00:13:59,480
I love it.

444
00:13:59,480 --> 00:14:00,480
How is it?

445
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:01,480
Delicious.

446
00:14:01,480 --> 00:14:03,480
It's so delicious.

447
00:14:05,480 --> 00:14:07,480
I'm not the type of person who talks.

448
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:11,480
I think it's the best to eat with
croissant.

449
00:14:11,480 --> 00:14:13,480
I'll eat this one first.

450
00:14:17,304 --> 00:14:18,304
It's fluffy!

451
00:14:18,304 --> 00:14:20,304
It's good!

452
00:14:20,304 --> 00:14:22,304
It's fluffy!

453
00:14:22,304 --> 00:14:23,304
It's so good!

454
00:14:23,304 --> 00:14:24,304
It's so good!

455
00:14:24,304 --> 00:14:26,304
It's light.

456
00:14:26,304 --> 00:14:28,304
Can you eat it right away?

457
00:14:28,304 --> 00:14:30,304
I can eat a lot of Wassan.

458
00:14:30,304 --> 00:14:32,304
It's a collaboration between cheese and
Wassan.

459
00:14:32,304 --> 00:14:34,304
A collaboration.

460
00:14:34,304 --> 00:14:36,304
Do you need a plate?

461
00:14:36,304 --> 00:14:37,304
I'm good.

462
00:14:37,304 --> 00:14:39,304
It's really good.

463
00:14:39,304 --> 00:14:40,304
It's the best.

464
00:14:40,304 --> 00:14:42,304
It's just our meal.

465
00:14:44,536 --> 00:14:46,536
I like it when people eat it.

466
00:14:47,536 --> 00:14:48,536
Me too.

467
00:14:49,536 --> 00:14:51,536
This cheese is delicious.

468
00:14:52,536 --> 00:14:54,536
It's definitely delicious with salad.

469
00:14:56,536 --> 00:14:58,536
This cheese is almost gone.

470
00:14:58,536 --> 00:14:59,536
It's too delicious.

471
00:15:02,536 --> 00:15:03,536
It's delicious.

472
00:15:04,536 --> 00:15:05,536
Can I eat this for the rest of my life?

473
00:15:07,536 --> 00:15:08,536
You can eat it.

474
00:15:08,536 --> 00:15:10,536
Thank you for watching.

475
00:15:10,960 --> 00:15:13,340
So we ate it!

476
00:15:13,340 --> 00:15:15,340
It was delicious!

477
00:15:15,340 --> 00:15:17,340
I'm so happy!

478
00:15:17,340 --> 00:15:19,340
I wonder if this happiness is enough.

479
00:15:19,340 --> 00:15:23,340
I'm worried that I might wake up
tomorrow.

480
00:15:23,340 --> 00:15:25,340
But we were able to share it with
everyone.

481
00:15:25,340 --> 00:15:27,340
Please buy it!

482
00:15:27,340 --> 00:15:29,340
Let's buy it at Costco!

483
00:15:29,340 --> 00:15:31,340
It's definitely delicious!

484
00:15:31,340 --> 00:15:37,340
Please subscribe to this channel and
like the video!

485
00:15:37,340 --> 00:15:39,340
We're waiting!

486
00:15:39,340 --> 00:15:41,340
Please!

487
00:15:41,340 --> 00:15:43,340
Please!

488
00:15:43,340 --> 00:15:45,340
This was Mayuka Sasaki and Anna Imamoto!

489
00:15:45,340 --> 00:15:47,340
Costco!

490
00:15:47,340 --> 00:15:49,340
The best!

491
00:15:49,340 --> 00:15:53,227
Bye bye!
