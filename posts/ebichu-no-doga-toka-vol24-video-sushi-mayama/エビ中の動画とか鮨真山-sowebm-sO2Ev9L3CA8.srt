00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Please watch the video of Ebichu!

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:06,000
I'm going to eat sushi!

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,000
Sushi, Mayama

4
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,000
I like sushi.

5
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,000
I think I like sushi at the level of a
normal human being.

6
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:18,000
I don't go to sushi restaurant often.

7
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:23,000
I think sushi is a reward.

8
00:00:24,696 --> 00:00:27,696
What is your favorite story?

9
00:00:27,696 --> 00:00:29,696
I always eat salmon roe.

10
00:00:29,696 --> 00:00:31,696
What is the most memorable thing you
have done with the members?

11
00:00:31,696 --> 00:00:35,696
I don't think I've ever been there in
private.

12
00:00:35,696 --> 00:00:38,696
I think it was when I was on a trip with
Mirei.

13
00:00:38,696 --> 00:00:45,696
I think we went to Harazawa together on
a front-row seat.

14
00:00:45,696 --> 00:00:50,696
I was asked to take sushi to the
principal at that time.

15
00:00:50,696 --> 00:00:52,696
It was delicious.

16
00:00:52,696 --> 00:00:58,696
I can't forget the taste of the crab at
that time.

17
00:00:58,696 --> 00:01:00,696
It was delicious.

18
00:01:00,696 --> 00:01:01,696
What is your favorite food?

19
00:01:01,696 --> 00:01:04,696
I haven't eaten much recently.

20
00:01:04,696 --> 00:01:07,696
I'm relying on Uber.

21
00:01:07,696 --> 00:01:12,696
My favorite food is cabbage.

22
00:01:13,056 --> 00:01:16,056
I love NAKOZAKAWA.

23
00:01:17,712 --> 00:01:19,192
I was fishing and fishing.

24
00:01:19,192 --> 00:01:23,032
What was it during the self-restraint
period?

25
00:01:23,032 --> 00:01:27,192
My mother bought me fish.

26
00:01:27,192 --> 00:01:32,912
I did only the work of removing the
gills.

27
00:01:32,912 --> 00:01:36,232
I admired the YouTuber KIMAGURE COOK.

28
00:01:36,232 --> 00:01:39,112
I've been watching him for a long time,
so I wanted to touch the fish.

29
00:01:39,112 --> 00:01:41,152
I did that.

30
00:01:41,152 --> 00:01:43,152
I have never done it.

31
00:01:43,152 --> 00:01:44,992
This is my first time.

32
00:01:44,992 --> 00:01:48,432
Can you catch fish with a rice ball?

33
00:01:48,432 --> 00:01:57,512
I'm not confident, but I want to enjoy
it.

34
00:01:58,672 --> 00:02:08,672
I prepare the sushi, scoop it, and shape
it with one hand.

35
00:02:08,672 --> 00:02:14,672
Then I scoop it, put wasabi on it, and
eat it.

36
00:02:14,672 --> 00:02:19,672
Now, I'd like to introduce the teacher
who will teach us how to grip sushi.

37
00:02:19,672 --> 00:02:23,672
I'm Hideki Sugiura, and I'm a sushi
master.

38
00:02:23,672 --> 00:02:28,672
Today, I'd like to ask Mr. Sugiura to
teach us.

39
00:02:28,672 --> 00:02:33,672
He will teach us how to grip, roll
sushi, and roll sushi.

40
00:02:33,672 --> 00:02:39,672
And I'd like to ask Mr. Fujii to eat the
sushi I gripped.

41
00:02:39,672 --> 00:02:44,608
I'll do my best to grip sushi.

42
00:02:44,608 --> 00:02:46,608
I'll show you how to do it.

43
00:02:46,608 --> 00:02:50,608
This is a piece of sushi that has been
cut and soaked in water.

44
00:02:50,608 --> 00:02:54,608
Put your hand on it and spread it out.

45
00:02:54,608 --> 00:02:56,608
Then, take the rice.

46
00:02:56,608 --> 00:02:58,608
After taking the rice,

47
00:02:58,608 --> 00:03:00,608
hold the neta on this side.

48
00:03:00,608 --> 00:03:04,608
Put the wasabi on the neta and put the
rice on top.

49
00:03:04,608 --> 00:03:08,608
It's a round thing like this.

50
00:03:08,608 --> 00:03:12,608
Adjust the length and hold it once.

51
00:03:12,608 --> 00:03:18,608
Then, turn it over and hold it again.

52
00:03:18,608 --> 00:03:22,608
Turn it 180 degrees and hold it again.

53
00:03:22,608 --> 00:03:24,608
Then, take it out.

54
00:03:24,608 --> 00:03:26,608
This is the general way.

55
00:03:26,608 --> 00:03:28,608
I'll do it.

56
00:03:28,608 --> 00:03:30,608
Take it as quickly as possible and roll
it.

57
00:03:30,608 --> 00:03:32,608
Roll it.

58
00:03:32,608 --> 00:03:38,608
Put the wasabi on the neta.

59
00:03:38,608 --> 00:03:42,608
Put the wasabi on the neta.

60
00:03:42,608 --> 00:03:44,608
Turn it 180 degrees.

61
00:03:44,608 --> 00:03:46,608
Put the wasabi on the neta.

62
00:03:46,608 --> 00:03:48,608
Then, take it out.

63
00:03:48,608 --> 00:03:51,608
It's finally in shape.

64
00:03:51,608 --> 00:03:56,608
I'll try to eat sushi that I gripped for
the first time.

65
00:03:56,608 --> 00:04:00,608
I did it well.

66
00:04:00,608 --> 00:04:02,608
How is it?

67
00:04:02,608 --> 00:04:04,608
I'll eat it.

68
00:04:04,608 --> 00:04:06,608
Put the wasabi on the neta.

69
00:04:06,608 --> 00:04:06,736
I'll eat it.

70
00:04:06,736 --> 00:04:08,076
Hm..

71
00:04:10,658 --> 00:04:11,658
Yes.

72
00:04:11,658 --> 00:04:13,658
The ingredients are delicious, so it's
delicious.

73
00:04:16,658 --> 00:04:18,658
I think I need a little less rice.

74
00:04:18,658 --> 00:04:20,658
It's delicious. The ingredients are
delicious.

75
00:04:21,658 --> 00:04:22,658
I'll do my best.

76
00:04:22,658 --> 00:04:25,658
The thin roll is a rolling pin.

77
00:04:25,658 --> 00:04:27,658
There is a back side.

78
00:04:27,658 --> 00:04:28,658
Put the seaweed on it.

79
00:04:28,658 --> 00:04:29,658
The rice is...

80
00:04:29,658 --> 00:04:30,658
Is this too much?

81
00:04:30,658 --> 00:04:32,658
I think it's more than a rice ball.

82
00:04:32,658 --> 00:04:33,658
Yes.

83
00:04:33,658 --> 00:04:34,658
Wow, that's enough.

84
00:04:34,658 --> 00:04:36,658
Put this on the left end.

85
00:04:36,658 --> 00:04:37,658
Left end.

86
00:04:37,658 --> 00:04:41,658
Hold it with your right hand and spread
it with your left hand.

87
00:04:41,658 --> 00:04:43,658
That's too fast.

88
00:04:44,658 --> 00:04:45,658
Do this.

89
00:04:45,658 --> 00:04:46,658
Yes.

90
00:04:46,658 --> 00:04:47,658
Stretch it all over.

91
00:04:47,658 --> 00:04:48,658
I see.

92
00:04:48,658 --> 00:04:50,658
Put wasabi on it.

93
00:04:50,658 --> 00:04:51,658
It's vivid.

94
00:04:51,658 --> 00:04:52,658
Great.

95
00:04:53,658 --> 00:04:56,658
Then put the ingredients on it.

96
00:04:56,658 --> 00:04:57,658
Yes.

97
00:04:57,658 --> 00:04:58,658
Hold the end.

98
00:04:58,658 --> 00:04:59,658
Hold the end.

99
00:04:59,658 --> 00:05:00,658
Don't let it fall in the middle.

100
00:05:00,658 --> 00:05:02,658
Put this on it.

101
00:05:02,658 --> 00:05:03,658
Yes.

102
00:05:03,658 --> 00:05:04,658
I'll show you the base.

103
00:05:04,658 --> 00:05:05,658
Yes.

104
00:05:05,658 --> 00:05:07,658
Turn this 90 degrees.

105
00:05:07,658 --> 00:05:10,224
Oh!

106
00:05:11,224 --> 00:05:13,224
Wait a minute, this is difficult.

107
00:05:14,224 --> 00:05:16,224
Isn't this more difficult than before?

108
00:05:17,224 --> 00:05:18,224
I agree. I can't remember it all.

109
00:05:19,224 --> 00:05:20,224
But let's try it.

110
00:05:20,224 --> 00:05:21,224
I'll do my best.

111
00:05:21,224 --> 00:05:26,176
First, I'd like to cut the net.

112
00:05:27,176 --> 00:05:30,176
I cut one net very thin.

113
00:05:31,176 --> 00:05:33,176
I'll check the back of the net.

114
00:05:34,176 --> 00:05:36,176
Oh, it's time to eat.

115
00:05:37,176 --> 00:05:38,176
Welcome.

116
00:05:38,176 --> 00:05:47,168
Thank you for watching.

117
00:05:48,168 --> 00:05:49,168
It's difficult.

118
00:05:49,168 --> 00:05:51,168
I'm sure we didn't have enough rice.

119
00:05:51,168 --> 00:05:53,168
It's really harder than it looks.

120
00:05:53,168 --> 00:05:55,168
It's easier to watch.

121
00:05:55,168 --> 00:05:57,168
From the right to the left.

122
00:06:07,168 --> 00:06:08,168
Hand.

123
00:06:09,168 --> 00:06:10,168
With both hands.

124
00:06:10,168 --> 00:06:11,168
Like this.

125
00:06:14,104 --> 00:06:16,104
I'm going to cut the rolls.

126
00:06:16,104 --> 00:06:18,104
1, 2, 3.

127
00:06:18,104 --> 00:06:20,104
I've gone to 3.

128
00:06:20,104 --> 00:06:22,104
1, 2, 3.

129
00:06:23,104 --> 00:06:25,104
I couldn't do it well at the end.

130
00:06:25,104 --> 00:06:26,104
Yes.

131
00:06:26,104 --> 00:06:28,104
Thank you.

132
00:06:28,104 --> 00:06:31,104
I did it.

133
00:06:31,488 --> 00:06:33,488
It's done.

134
00:06:33,488 --> 00:06:37,488
I'm going to do the same thing as
before, without putting anything in.

135
00:06:37,488 --> 00:06:45,488
I'm going to make it into a sushi shape
and put the seaweed around it.

136
00:06:45,488 --> 00:06:47,488
It looks delicious.

137
00:06:47,488 --> 00:06:50,488
I don't know if it's easy, but I'm not
doing it.

138
00:06:50,488 --> 00:06:53,488
I don't think it's easy, but it looks
delicious.

139
00:06:53,488 --> 00:06:55,488
I want to eat it.

140
00:06:55,488 --> 00:06:57,488
This is the point.

141
00:06:57,488 --> 00:07:01,488
I'm going to challenge the military.

142
00:07:07,514 --> 00:07:18,514
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12,
13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20.

143
00:07:20,514 --> 00:07:24,514
It's hard to get the rice to stick to
the pan.

144
00:07:24,514 --> 00:07:26,514
That's a lot.

145
00:07:26,514 --> 00:07:28,672
Sorry.

146
00:07:29,672 --> 00:07:30,672
That's good.

147
00:07:31,672 --> 00:07:33,672
You need to take 1.5 times more.

148
00:07:34,672 --> 00:07:35,672
But it looks good.

149
00:07:35,672 --> 00:07:39,472
I did it!

150
00:07:39,472 --> 00:07:41,472
The price is 1.5 times higher.

151
00:07:41,472 --> 00:07:45,472
Next, I'd like to compare the two.

152
00:07:45,472 --> 00:07:52,472
I said that I'd like to have the squid
eaten by the head chef, but I'd like to
have the squid.

153
00:07:52,472 --> 00:08:00,472
I'd like to have the squid, which is a
little too greedy for the squid and a
little too much.

154
00:08:00,472 --> 00:08:03,408
I'll eat it.

155
00:08:04,408 --> 00:08:05,408
But it's delicious.

156
00:08:05,408 --> 00:08:07,408
I put too much salmon roe.

157
00:08:07,408 --> 00:08:09,408
I can tell by eating.

158
00:08:09,408 --> 00:08:13,408
It's not that you should put too much
salmon roe.

159
00:08:13,408 --> 00:08:15,408
I'd like to have the master's.

160
00:08:15,408 --> 00:08:16,408
I'll eat it.

161
00:08:16,408 --> 00:08:24,408
It's delicious.

162
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:28,640
The balance between the rice and the
ingredients is delicious.

163
00:08:28,640 --> 00:08:37,680
I felt that the balance between the rice
and the ingredients is really important,
even if it is one military canteen.

164
00:08:37,680 --> 00:08:39,880
It's delicious.

165
00:08:39,880 --> 00:08:42,680
Put the knife in the middle like this.

166
00:08:42,680 --> 00:08:44,480
It's beautiful. Hello.

167
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:48,680
Now you can hold it.

168
00:08:48,680 --> 00:08:50,480
Please take it out.

169
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:53,680
Now I'm going to hold the shrimp.

170
00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:59,880
First, I'll put the shrimp on the rice.

171
00:08:59,962 --> 00:09:01,962
I think it's going to cut.

172
00:09:01,962 --> 00:09:03,962
It's going to cut.

173
00:09:03,962 --> 00:09:05,962
Yes, that's good.

174
00:09:05,962 --> 00:09:07,962
I opened this.

175
00:09:07,962 --> 00:09:09,962
I can stand up.

176
00:09:09,962 --> 00:09:11,962
Yes.

177
00:09:11,962 --> 00:09:13,962
I think it's a fate that blooms.

178
00:09:13,962 --> 00:09:15,962
This is a little more.

179
00:09:15,962 --> 00:09:17,962
Help me a little.

180
00:09:17,962 --> 00:09:22,458
Thank you for your viewing.

181
00:09:22,458 --> 00:09:24,458
Thank you very much!

182
00:09:24,458 --> 00:09:27,458
With the help of my master, I was able
to cut the shrimp!

183
00:09:27,458 --> 00:09:29,458
The tip was difficult.

184
00:09:29,458 --> 00:09:31,458
Excuse me.

185
00:09:31,458 --> 00:09:33,458
This is difficult.

186
00:09:33,458 --> 00:09:44,090
This is difficult.

187
00:09:44,090 --> 00:09:48,090
I forgot the steps.

188
00:09:48,090 --> 00:09:49,090
What?

189
00:09:49,090 --> 00:09:54,090
Like this, and this, and this.

190
00:09:54,090 --> 00:10:00,090
Turn it, hold it sideways, and from the
top.

191
00:10:00,090 --> 00:10:01,090
Yes, yes.

192
00:10:01,090 --> 00:10:02,090
And?

193
00:10:02,090 --> 00:10:04,090
Turn it the other way.

194
00:10:04,090 --> 00:10:05,090
Like this?

195
00:10:05,090 --> 00:10:06,090
Yes.

196
00:10:06,090 --> 00:10:08,090
It's a little bit broken.

197
00:10:08,090 --> 00:10:11,090
It's hard, but I did it.

198
00:10:11,090 --> 00:10:14,090
I'll go to the bathroom.

199
00:10:16,762 --> 00:10:23,762
I'll make a shape, and then...

200
00:10:23,762 --> 00:10:25,762
Then...

201
00:10:25,762 --> 00:10:27,762
Yes!

202
00:10:27,762 --> 00:10:28,762
Yes!

203
00:10:28,762 --> 00:10:29,762
Yes!

204
00:10:29,762 --> 00:10:31,056
Thank you for watching!

205
00:10:31,056 --> 00:10:32,256
Oh, that's good.

206
00:10:32,256 --> 00:10:34,256
Okay, I'll be waiting!

207
00:10:34,256 --> 00:10:35,956
This is hard.

208
00:10:35,956 --> 00:10:37,456
I barely got the sweet shrimp.

209
00:10:37,456 --> 00:10:39,656
Yeah, the car shrimp...

210
00:10:39,656 --> 00:10:43,156
You should have put in a little less.

211
00:10:43,156 --> 00:10:44,956
Oh, there were too many.

212
00:10:44,956 --> 00:10:46,356
But it's hard.

213
00:10:46,356 --> 00:10:48,356
There were too many.

214
00:10:48,356 --> 00:10:49,556
This is the real one.

215
00:10:49,556 --> 00:10:50,456
The real one.

216
00:10:50,456 --> 00:10:52,656
The ones in the sushi restaurants are
called white-tailed sea breams.

217
00:10:52,656 --> 00:10:53,656
Oh, I see.

218
00:10:53,656 --> 00:10:56,656
This is a pretty expensive sushi.

219
00:10:56,656 --> 00:10:59,556
The sea bream has a lot of wasabi, so
put in a little less.

220
00:10:59,556 --> 00:11:01,556
A little less.

221
00:11:02,522 --> 00:11:04,522
It's getting smaller.

222
00:11:04,522 --> 00:11:06,522
It's moving.

223
00:11:06,522 --> 00:11:10,522
It's moving!

224
00:11:10,522 --> 00:11:12,522
I'll show you a trick.

225
00:11:12,522 --> 00:11:14,522
Excuse me.

226
00:11:14,522 --> 00:11:16,522
Pull it with a clip.

227
00:11:18,522 --> 00:11:20,522
I did it.

228
00:11:20,522 --> 00:11:23,522
Put the knife in three times.

229
00:11:23,522 --> 00:11:28,864
I'll show you a trick.

230
00:11:29,864 --> 00:11:30,864
1

231
00:11:31,864 --> 00:11:32,864
2

232
00:11:34,864 --> 00:11:35,864
3

233
00:11:37,864 --> 00:11:38,864
4

234
00:11:40,864 --> 00:11:41,864
5

235
00:11:44,864 --> 00:11:45,864
6

236
00:11:46,864 --> 00:11:47,864
7

237
00:11:47,864 --> 00:11:49,864
Thank you for watching!

238
00:11:51,184 --> 00:11:53,184
Well, yeah.

239
00:11:53,184 --> 00:11:54,184
Nice!

240
00:11:54,184 --> 00:11:56,184
Oh, I hit my leg.

241
00:11:56,184 --> 00:11:59,184
I've been taught that I can do it many
times.

242
00:12:05,184 --> 00:12:07,184
Let's do it again.

243
00:12:10,184 --> 00:12:12,184
Oh, nice!

244
00:12:12,184 --> 00:12:16,184
So, here's the real thing.

245
00:12:16,184 --> 00:12:18,000
Hey!

246
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,000
It didn't shrink a bit.

247
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:27,000
It didn't shrink, but it became a very
gentle shape.

248
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,000
I'm going to make a Thai style.

249
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:33,000
Welcome.

250
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:38,000
I'd like a Thai, please.

251
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,000
Thai, Thai, Thai.

252
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:42,000
Certainly.

253
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,000
I'm going to make it.

254
00:12:55,322 --> 00:12:57,322
I'm so nervous.

255
00:12:57,322 --> 00:12:59,322
I'm so nervous.

256
00:12:59,322 --> 00:13:01,322
I'm so nervous.

257
00:13:01,322 --> 00:13:03,322
I'm getting nervous from the beginning.

258
00:13:03,322 --> 00:13:24,322
I'm more nervous than any of the recent
games.

259
00:13:24,410 --> 00:13:26,410
I'm going to try it.

260
00:13:26,410 --> 00:13:28,410
It's good.

261
00:13:28,410 --> 00:13:30,410
I'm looking forward to it.

262
00:13:32,410 --> 00:13:34,410
I might post this on my Instagram.

263
00:13:34,410 --> 00:13:36,410
I'll try it.

264
00:13:40,410 --> 00:13:42,410
It's good.

265
00:13:42,410 --> 00:13:44,410
Thank you.

266
00:13:44,410 --> 00:13:46,410
It's good.

267
00:13:46,410 --> 00:13:52,410
Thank you.

268
00:13:53,928 --> 00:13:55,928
It's a little thick.

269
00:13:55,928 --> 00:13:58,928
I sang a flower song.

270
00:14:22,522 --> 00:14:24,522
I'm waiting for the room.

271
00:14:34,522 --> 00:14:36,522
It's delicious.

272
00:14:36,522 --> 00:14:38,522
Thank you.

273
00:14:38,522 --> 00:14:43,482
Please watch the next video.

274
00:14:43,482 --> 00:14:45,482
Oh, so you don't use a lot of chili.

275
00:14:45,482 --> 00:14:46,482
That's right.

276
00:14:46,482 --> 00:14:49,482
But if I wanted to make her cry, I'd put
a lot on.

277
00:14:49,482 --> 00:14:51,482
Oh, so you're going to put a lot on.

278
00:14:51,482 --> 00:14:53,482
I'll see how it goes.

279
00:14:53,482 --> 00:14:59,482
I've heard that people eat a lot of
wasabi and dried fish rolls when they
drink.

280
00:15:00,482 --> 00:15:01,482
What is it?

281
00:15:01,482 --> 00:15:02,482
It's nothing.

282
00:15:02,482 --> 00:15:05,482
A lot of wasabi and dried fish rolls.

283
00:15:05,482 --> 00:15:06,482
I see.

284
00:15:06,482 --> 00:15:07,482
You like it.

285
00:15:07,482 --> 00:15:09,482
I don't have it at the store.

286
00:15:09,482 --> 00:15:11,482
You can make dried fish rolls with dried
fish.

287
00:15:11,482 --> 00:15:13,482
Really?

288
00:15:15,482 --> 00:15:16,482
He doesn't react at all.

289
00:15:16,482 --> 00:15:20,482
He was in a bad mood today.

290
00:15:23,290 --> 00:15:25,290
I'm waiting.

291
00:15:25,290 --> 00:15:29,290
It's like a small piece of art.

292
00:15:29,290 --> 00:15:31,290
It's like an object.

293
00:15:31,290 --> 00:15:37,290
The crispy texture and the unique
sweetness of the shellfish are very
delicious.

294
00:15:37,290 --> 00:15:38,290
Thank you.

295
00:15:38,290 --> 00:15:41,290
Then, add more wasabi to the Kanpyo
roll.

296
00:15:41,290 --> 00:15:43,290
Add more wasabi than you can imagine.

297
00:15:43,290 --> 00:15:44,290
I see.

298
00:15:44,290 --> 00:15:46,290
I'm not kidding.

299
00:15:46,290 --> 00:15:48,290
Add a lot.

300
00:15:48,290 --> 00:15:52,250
Yes.

301
00:15:52,250 --> 00:15:54,250
Please put a lot of wasabi.

302
00:15:55,250 --> 00:15:57,250
This is going to be a lot of work.

303
00:15:58,250 --> 00:15:59,250
Are you sure?

304
00:16:00,250 --> 00:16:02,250
I heard you like it.

305
00:16:06,250 --> 00:16:08,250
Take it out and shape it.

306
00:16:09,250 --> 00:16:10,250
Like this.

307
00:16:11,250 --> 00:16:12,250
Okay.

308
00:16:13,250 --> 00:16:15,250
One, two, three.

309
00:16:15,250 --> 00:16:18,250
One, two, three.

310
00:16:20,026 --> 00:16:22,026
Hey, what's up?

311
00:16:32,794 --> 00:16:34,294
I love the smell of ginger.

312
00:16:34,294 --> 00:16:35,294
How is it?

313
00:16:35,294 --> 00:16:36,294
It's delicious.

314
00:16:36,294 --> 00:16:38,294
I'm glad. Thank you.

315
00:16:38,294 --> 00:16:40,294
It's strong. Wasabi is strong.

316
00:16:40,294 --> 00:16:43,294
I put a lot of wasabi in it.

317
00:16:43,294 --> 00:16:44,294
It's strong.

318
00:16:48,294 --> 00:16:49,294
The kante-matsu is delicious.

319
00:16:49,294 --> 00:16:50,294
Thank you.

320
00:16:50,294 --> 00:16:51,294
It's good.

321
00:16:51,294 --> 00:17:00,294
Thank you.

322
00:17:00,506 --> 00:17:02,506
Oops, it's too small.

323
00:17:13,082 --> 00:17:15,082
Wait a minute.

324
00:17:15,082 --> 00:17:17,082
A little more.

325
00:17:19,082 --> 00:17:21,082
I'll eat it.

326
00:17:21,082 --> 00:17:23,082
Eat up.

327
00:17:24,496 --> 00:17:26,496
It's sweet and delicious.

328
00:17:26,496 --> 00:17:28,496
We use good ingredients.

329
00:17:28,496 --> 00:17:30,496
I'd like to have 10 bowls of rice.

330
00:17:30,496 --> 00:17:31,496
What?

331
00:17:31,496 --> 00:17:32,496
I'd like to have 10 bowls of rice.

332
00:17:32,496 --> 00:17:33,496
10 bowls of rice?

333
00:17:33,496 --> 00:17:37,496
Please go to a seafood bowl restaurant.

334
00:17:38,496 --> 00:17:44,496
I was training at a sushi restaurant
called Mayama.

335
00:17:44,496 --> 00:17:48,496
It's hard to make sushi.

336
00:17:48,496 --> 00:17:54,496
It's really hard to make sushi.

337
00:17:54,496 --> 00:18:00,496
It was difficult to balance all the
ingredients.

338
00:18:00,496 --> 00:18:03,496
I practiced for a long time.

339
00:18:03,496 --> 00:18:05,496
But I couldn't do it well in the actual
performance.

340
00:18:05,496 --> 00:18:13,496
I learned that if I master the first
skill of my right hand, I can make sushi
better.

341
00:18:13,496 --> 00:18:18,496
I'd like to practice at home and make a
great sushi restaurant.

342
00:18:18,496 --> 00:18:20,496
It was fun.

343
00:18:20,496 --> 00:18:27,496
I was happy to have someone eat my
sushi.

344
00:18:27,496 --> 00:18:34,496
I'm sorry I'm not confident in my sushi.

345
00:18:34,496 --> 00:18:37,496
I had a very grateful experience.

346
00:18:37,496 --> 00:18:41,496
Please go to a sushi restaurant.
