In the 9th issue, Rika Mayama from Shiritsu Ebisu Chugaku makes her first appearance. On the other end of the line is her best friend from elementary school, Nacchi-san.

What does Nacchi-san, who has been watching over Mayama through happy times and difficult times, think about her now? What is Mayama's "true" self that is revealed in the conversation with her best friend?
