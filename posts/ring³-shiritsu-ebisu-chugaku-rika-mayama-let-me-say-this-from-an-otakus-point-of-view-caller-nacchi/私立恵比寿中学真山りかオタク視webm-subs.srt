1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,920
I say yes, but I don't get it.

2
00:00:04,920 --> 00:00:21,050
I don't like me being

3
00:00:21,050 --> 00:00:23,050
Excuse me.

4
00:00:30,050 --> 00:00:31,050
I'm going to do it.

5
00:00:33,050 --> 00:00:34,050
Oh, no.

6
00:00:34,050 --> 00:00:39,290
I got it.

7
00:00:39,290 --> 00:00:41,130
What the-

8
00:00:45,250 --> 00:00:46,730
Hello...?

9
00:00:46,730 --> 00:00:48,930
Hellooo?

10
00:00:48,930 --> 00:00:50,150
Hello!

11
00:00:50,150 --> 00:00:51,610
Hellooo?

12
00:00:53,890 --> 00:00:55,510
Hello last flirtatio

13
00:00:55,510 --> 00:00:57,490
Hellooo

14
00:00:57,490 --> 00:00:58,810
Hello

15
00:00:59,750 --> 00:01:01,750
, eh, eh, err?

16
00:01:01,750 --> 00:01:03,390
Who are you?

17
00:01:03,390 --> 00:00:40,710
Who are you, hey, yeah!

18
00:01:05,990 --> 00:01:07,590
Ah!!! Let me think!

19
00:01:07,590 --> 00:01:09,650
Thank you very much ammo

20
00:01:09,650 --> 00:01:10,710
Hinata

21
00:01:10,730 --> 00:01:10,778
Ohno

22
00:01:10,778 --> 00:01:12,778
Hello?

23
00:01:12,778 --> 00:01:14,778
Hello?

24
00:01:14,778 --> 00:01:16,778
What?

25
00:01:16,778 --> 00:01:18,778
Do you need a hint?

26
00:01:18,778 --> 00:01:20,778
It's been a while since we last met,
right?

27
00:01:20,778 --> 00:01:24,778
Yeah, it's been about two years.

28
00:01:24,778 --> 00:01:26,778
I don't know.

29
00:01:26,778 --> 00:01:28,778
What?

30
00:01:28,778 --> 00:01:30,778
I'm the same age as you.

31
00:01:30,778 --> 00:01:32,778
What?

32
00:01:32,778 --> 00:01:36,778
I'm a middle school and elementary
school classmate.

33
00:01:36,778 --> 00:01:38,448
I'm a middle school and elementary
school classmate.

34
00:01:38,448 --> 00:01:40,448
I got it!

35
00:01:40,448 --> 00:01:42,448
I'm glad.

36
00:01:42,448 --> 00:01:44,448
You don't really know.

37
00:01:44,448 --> 00:01:46,448
Yeah.

38
00:01:46,448 --> 00:01:48,448
It's been a while.

39
00:01:48,448 --> 00:01:50,448
It's been a while.

40
00:01:50,448 --> 00:01:52,448
How are you?

41
00:01:52,448 --> 00:01:54,448
I'm fine.

42
00:01:54,448 --> 00:01:56,448
I'm glad.

43
00:01:56,448 --> 00:02:00,448
When I hear you on the phone, I feel
like your voice is different.

44
00:02:00,448 --> 00:02:06,448
Yeah, but you don't feel that different.

45
00:02:06,448 --> 00:02:07,872
I feel like...

46
00:02:07,872 --> 00:02:14,512
I was nervous until just now, like when
I'm doing Ebichu.

47
00:02:14,512 --> 00:02:17,712
I was like, hello? I was thinking about
doing it.

48
00:02:17,712 --> 00:02:20,192
But I was more nervous than I thought.

49
00:02:20,192 --> 00:02:21,352
Yeah.

50
00:02:21,352 --> 00:02:22,552
And...

51
00:02:22,552 --> 00:02:24,912
When I said hello, I was out.

52
00:02:24,912 --> 00:02:26,152
I'm out of the frame now.

53
00:02:26,152 --> 00:02:29,432
It's okay. Please do it like that.

54
00:02:29,432 --> 00:02:30,872
Yeah.

55
00:02:30,872 --> 00:02:33,672
I don't really call in the first place,
either.

56
00:02:33,672 --> 00:02:35,712
That's right. Because I'm pretty...

57
00:02:35,712 --> 00:02:37,296
Well, I don't really call...

58
00:02:37,296 --> 00:02:38,536
You're not good at it?

59
00:02:38,536 --> 00:02:40,536
No, I'm not good at calling.

60
00:02:42,256 --> 00:02:43,836
You know,

61
00:02:43,836 --> 00:02:46,496
when we meet,

62
00:02:46,496 --> 00:02:49,136
we always talk about recent things.

63
00:02:49,136 --> 00:02:49,936
That's right.

64
00:02:49,936 --> 00:02:52,376
I think about it again,

65
00:02:52,376 --> 00:02:56,836
but I don't remember much about when we
got close.

66
00:02:56,836 --> 00:02:58,336
Really?

67
00:02:58,336 --> 00:02:59,976
I'm sorry.

68
00:02:59,976 --> 00:03:01,336
I remember.

69
00:03:01,336 --> 00:03:02,056
Really?

70
00:03:02,056 --> 00:03:04,368
That was the most refreshing thing that
could happen in 1998.

71
00:03:04,368 --> 00:03:09,708
I really don't remember the old days. I
don't remember the time when I was a
child.

72
00:03:10,188 --> 00:03:11,188
What?

73
00:03:11,188 --> 00:03:11,808
Tell me!

74
00:03:11,808 --> 00:03:12,808
I showed it to me!

75
00:03:12,808 --> 00:03:13,308
Show me!

76
00:03:13,308 --> 00:03:14,488
Let me remember it!

77
00:03:14,488 --> 00:03:16,464
There is an article called ーBe Judith ー

78
00:03:16,464 --> 00:03:22,924
When I was in elementary school, I was
bullied.

79
00:03:22,924 --> 00:03:26,584
I was bullied properly.

80
00:03:26,584 --> 00:03:30,664
When I was bullied, I was alone.

81
00:03:30,664 --> 00:03:35,704
I was being together with my classmates.

82
00:03:35,704 --> 00:03:36,704
I see.

83
00:03:36,704 --> 00:03:38,704
I was bullied.

84
00:03:38,704 --> 00:03:40,704
Do you remember?

85
00:03:40,704 --> 00:03:45,024
I remember very well.

86
00:03:45,024 --> 00:03:45,120
ーBe Judithー

87
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:48,120
ーYou couldn't say it? ーYeah.

88
00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:55,120
ーBut you're doing something very
carefully.

89
00:03:55,120 --> 00:04:00,120
ーIt's normal to be with friends.

90
00:04:00,120 --> 00:04:03,120
ーThat's the image I have. ーI'm happy.

91
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:06,120
ーI'm about to cry. ーIt's okay.

92
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:09,120
ーWait. It's too early to cry.

93
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:13,120
ーEat more. ーI'm so happy.

94
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:15,024
ーSo...

95
00:04:15,024 --> 00:04:17,024
Don't laugh at me!

96
00:04:19,024 --> 00:04:21,024
Well...

97
00:04:21,024 --> 00:04:23,024
After I got into junior high school,

98
00:04:23,024 --> 00:04:33,024
I was pretty active in elementary
school.

99
00:04:33,024 --> 00:04:17,024
But I was bullied because I didn't have
a good sense of

100
00:04:17,024 --> 00:04:25,024
being noticeable.

101
00:04:25,024 --> 00:04:27,024
That's right.

102
00:04:29,024 --> 00:04:41,024
I was bullied because I was not good at
being noticeable in elementary school.

103
00:04:41,024 --> 00:04:43,024
It's not bad.

104
00:04:43,024 --> 00:04:44,016
Thank you.

105
00:04:44,016 --> 00:04:46,016
You were always by my side.

106
00:04:46,016 --> 00:04:51,016
After I got into middle school, we
became a club.

107
00:04:51,016 --> 00:04:53,016
That's right.

108
00:04:53,016 --> 00:04:58,016
That's the beginning of my otaku life.

109
00:04:58,016 --> 00:05:04,016
I often see your otaku life.

110
00:05:04,016 --> 00:05:08,016
But is it my fault?

111
00:05:08,016 --> 00:05:10,016
Yes.

112
00:05:10,016 --> 00:05:13,632
You and me, Yuckey.

113
00:05:13,632 --> 00:05:14,632
Yes, yes, yes.

114
00:05:14,632 --> 00:05:15,632
Nagisa-chan and so on.

115
00:05:15,632 --> 00:05:16,632
That's right.

116
00:05:16,632 --> 00:05:17,632
That's how it started.

117
00:05:17,632 --> 00:05:20,632
But I really thought it was okay.

118
00:05:20,632 --> 00:05:21,632
Really?

119
00:05:21,632 --> 00:05:27,632
So I joined the art club and we were
together more often.

120
00:05:27,632 --> 00:05:28,632
Yes.

121
00:05:28,632 --> 00:05:32,632
When I was in elementary school, I was
bullied.

122
00:05:32,632 --> 00:05:35,632
When I said something, he said,

123
00:05:35,632 --> 00:05:37,632
Yeah, that's right.

124
00:05:37,632 --> 00:05:40,128
But I was trying to stand out.

125
00:05:40,128 --> 00:05:43,128
I was like, you're bad too.

126
00:05:43,128 --> 00:05:44,128
You said that?

127
00:05:44,128 --> 00:05:45,128
I did.

128
00:05:45,128 --> 00:05:46,128
Really?

129
00:05:46,128 --> 00:05:48,128
I was like, really?

130
00:05:48,128 --> 00:05:52,128
But I didn't have any friends who would
say that.

131
00:05:52,128 --> 00:05:56,128
Even if you're not from the same family,
you're really not Italian.

132
00:05:56,128 --> 00:05:59,128
I regret it so much.

133
00:05:59,128 --> 00:06:00,128
Really?

134
00:06:00,128 --> 00:06:03,456
But I was really grateful for that.

135
00:06:03,456 --> 00:06:13,056
I think I've been hurt by people without
knowing because I don't have any
delicacy.

136
00:06:13,056 --> 00:06:21,656
I'm glad that there are people who say
that when I grow up.

137
00:06:21,656 --> 00:06:27,056
But it's not bad to stand out.

138
00:06:27,056 --> 00:06:28,464
No, no, no.

139
00:06:28,464 --> 00:06:30,464
It's not bad at all.

140
00:06:30,464 --> 00:06:38,464
Well, it's a detailed story, but when I
entered the agency, I was told to dance
in the class.

141
00:06:38,464 --> 00:06:40,464
Oh, yeah.

142
00:06:40,464 --> 00:06:44,464
And I was bad at dancing, but I was
dancing.

143
00:06:44,464 --> 00:06:45,464
Yeah.

144
00:06:45,464 --> 00:06:49,464
He said, I didn't say no to that. You're
bad, too.

145
00:06:49,464 --> 00:06:55,464
But I think it was really the same.

146
00:06:55,464 --> 00:06:58,224
I can't say no to that.

147
00:06:58,224 --> 00:07:08,224
I can't say no to that. But if I had the
courage to say no, I would have been
able to get along with them sooner.

148
00:07:08,224 --> 00:07:13,224
I think I can feel that elementary
school students were better for me.

149
00:07:13,224 --> 00:07:23,224
But really, thanks to you, in elementary
school, we were together at the
automatic meeting.

150
00:07:23,224 --> 00:07:26,928
Including that, I think I was able to
get along with them.

151
00:07:26,928 --> 00:07:33,928
I was having a hard time in the
classroom, but

152
00:07:33,928 --> 00:07:40,928
I had a lot of fun when I got to know
the school.

153
00:07:40,928 --> 00:07:43,928
I'm glad to hear that.

154
00:07:43,928 --> 00:07:44,928
I'm glad to hear that.

155
00:07:44,928 --> 00:07:47,928
I can't get back to elementary school.

156
00:07:47,928 --> 00:07:49,928
That's true.

157
00:07:49,928 --> 00:07:56,400
I'm talking about my old days.

158
00:07:56,400 --> 00:07:58,400
I remember that.

159
00:07:58,400 --> 00:08:04,900
I've been to a special event.

160
00:08:04,900 --> 00:08:08,400
I mean, a free event.

161
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:10,400
I've been to a free event.

162
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:14,400
You don't remember, do you?

163
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:16,400
No way.

164
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:18,400
I haven't been to a special event.

165
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:19,400
When?

166
00:08:19,400 --> 00:08:22,400
Cinderella in a temporary contract.

167
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:24,400
Cinderella in a temporary contract?

168
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:25,824
Kawasaki?

169
00:08:25,824 --> 00:08:28,824
I don't know. You can see it from
behind.

170
00:08:28,824 --> 00:08:30,824
What? At Korakuen?

171
00:08:30,824 --> 00:08:32,824
But I don't know even if you tell me.

172
00:08:32,824 --> 00:08:33,824
Why?

173
00:08:33,824 --> 00:08:34,824
I don't remember.

174
00:08:34,824 --> 00:08:36,824
At least remember that.

175
00:08:36,824 --> 00:08:38,824
I don't know.

176
00:08:38,824 --> 00:08:41,824
But I saw it from behind.

177
00:08:41,824 --> 00:08:46,896
I remember it was a bit far from my
middle school classmates.

178
00:08:46,896 --> 00:08:54,976
If I was a bit more mature, I would have
been in the top class area of the C.D.

179
00:08:54,976 --> 00:08:56,776
But I didn't have that kind of
knowledge.

180
00:08:56,776 --> 00:08:59,376
I would look behind me and think,

181
00:08:59,376 --> 00:09:01,776
I'm doing it.

182
00:09:01,776 --> 00:09:04,616
You'd think I'm doing it.

183
00:09:04,616 --> 00:09:06,616
Yeah.

184
00:09:06,616 --> 00:09:09,296
After that, I finished and

185
00:09:09,296 --> 00:09:11,896
I sent an email on the way home.

186
00:09:11,896 --> 00:09:12,000
stuff

187
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:15,800
I actually saw it today, but I'm glad. I
sent an email.

188
00:09:15,800 --> 00:09:20,300
I remember the email saying, why don't
you say it?

189
00:09:20,300 --> 00:09:23,500
I don't remember at all. I'm sorry.

190
00:09:23,500 --> 00:09:27,300
I don't think you remember. I don't
think it's a place.

191
00:09:27,300 --> 00:09:29,000
But I'm glad.

192
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,800
That's a good memory.

193
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:34,100
How was I at that time?

194
00:09:34,100 --> 00:09:37,440
But that's a cute costume.

195
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:38,440
Really?

196
00:09:38,440 --> 00:09:41,440
It's typical idol costume.

197
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:43,440
I'm impressed.

198
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:45,440
Really? I'm happy.

199
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:48,440
I was surprised by her back.

200
00:09:48,440 --> 00:09:50,440
She was cute.

201
00:09:50,440 --> 00:09:52,440
You didn't see my front.

202
00:09:52,440 --> 00:09:53,440
No, I didn't.

203
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:55,440
But I saw her back.

204
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:57,440
But she didn't notice me.

205
00:09:57,440 --> 00:09:59,440
I thought she didn't notice me.

206
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:01,440
Did you make her sad?

207
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:02,440
No, no.

208
00:10:02,440 --> 00:10:04,440
I'm glad she didn't notice me.

209
00:10:04,440 --> 00:10:06,720
Really?

210
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:09,720
I'm glad you did.

211
00:10:09,720 --> 00:10:16,720
But you came to the concert a few years
later, right?

212
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:20,720
Yeah, I was invited recently.

213
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:22,720
Recently?

214
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:24,720
Didn't you say it was recently?

215
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:26,720
About two years ago.

216
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:28,720
About two years ago?

217
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:30,720
I haven't seen you much.

218
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:32,720
I don't know why.

219
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:33,264
I'm sorry.

220
00:10:33,264 --> 00:10:52,264
Once, when I had a special offer, I
bought a scholarship, so it was a lot of
fun when I got hit by Ebichu's Taiwan.

221
00:10:52,264 --> 00:10:55,264
That's true.

222
00:10:55,264 --> 00:11:00,264
I texted you when it was announced. I
thought you'd definitely go.

223
00:11:00,264 --> 00:11:02,448
I had a lot of fun.

224
00:11:02,448 --> 00:11:07,688
I'm glad when I suddenly appear in my
own life.

225
00:11:07,688 --> 00:11:11,648
I'm saying that I watch it every week.

226
00:11:11,648 --> 00:11:16,688
That's right. I'm sorry, but I haven't
seen it in a while.

227
00:11:16,688 --> 00:11:19,808
I'm sorry.

228
00:11:19,808 --> 00:11:23,808
I thought it was the most enjoyable.

229
00:11:23,808 --> 00:11:31,680
I'm watching it normally, and I'm sad
about the farewell with Jishu.

230
00:11:31,680 --> 00:11:33,680
Suddenly, when Ebichu said,

231
00:11:33,680 --> 00:11:36,680
Next is my part time job, I was like,

232
00:11:36,680 --> 00:11:38,680
What?

233
00:11:38,680 --> 00:11:40,680
Seriously?

234
00:11:40,680 --> 00:11:45,680
And I actually had a ticket for the last
event.

235
00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:46,680
Oh, I see.

236
00:11:46,680 --> 00:11:50,680
So if it was held,

237
00:11:50,680 --> 00:11:55,968
I would have to be in the audience seat
the whole day.

238
00:11:55,968 --> 00:11:57,968
That was dangerous.

239
00:11:57,968 --> 00:11:59,968
That was dangerous.

240
00:11:59,968 --> 00:12:01,968
I'll watch it. I'm sorry.

241
00:12:01,968 --> 00:12:03,968
Thank you for watching.

242
00:12:05,968 --> 00:12:07,968
There are many things that happened in
the past.

243
00:12:07,968 --> 00:12:09,968
There are many things.

244
00:12:09,968 --> 00:12:15,968
I had a thing about Matsuno.

245
00:12:15,968 --> 00:12:17,968
Did I say that?

246
00:12:17,968 --> 00:12:21,968
I met him for the first time after that.

247
00:12:21,968 --> 00:12:24,432
He is a family member.

248
00:12:24,432 --> 00:12:27,432
Oh, I don't know.

249
00:12:27,432 --> 00:12:29,432
Really? You didn't know?

250
00:12:29,432 --> 00:12:32,432
Where were you going at that time?

251
00:12:32,432 --> 00:12:36,432
I don't know. How many years ago? Sorry.

252
00:12:36,432 --> 00:12:40,432
About a year ago? Maybe it was at that
time.

253
00:12:40,432 --> 00:12:45,432
But it's pretty unexpected.

254
00:12:45,432 --> 00:12:50,432
I'm spending most of my time in school
or in school.

255
00:12:50,432 --> 00:12:53,808
I didn't go out with anyone.

256
00:12:53,808 --> 00:13:01,808
I was lucky to have a friend who could
go out with me.

257
00:13:01,808 --> 00:13:03,808
I see.

258
00:13:03,808 --> 00:13:05,808
I was very grateful.

259
00:13:05,808 --> 00:13:07,808
I see.

260
00:13:07,808 --> 00:13:20,788
It was like a

261
00:13:20,788 --> 00:13:23,136
mother to my daughter.

262
00:13:23,136 --> 00:13:24,136
We are the same age.

263
00:13:24,136 --> 00:13:29,136
We are the same age, but we are in good
care of each other.

264
00:13:29,136 --> 00:13:36,136
I'm so happy to report that I can handle
it myself.

265
00:13:36,136 --> 00:13:39,136
I'll listen to you when I have
something.

266
00:13:39,136 --> 00:13:43,136
I'll do my best to be a good person.

267
00:13:43,136 --> 00:13:46,136
You're the only one who says that.

268
00:13:46,136 --> 00:13:48,528
That's not true.

269
00:13:48,528 --> 00:13:50,928
Wait, I'm about to cry, so stop it.

270
00:13:50,928 --> 00:13:51,828
Really?

271
00:13:51,828 --> 00:13:53,328
I'm crying.

272
00:13:53,328 --> 00:13:56,328
Don't cry.

273
00:13:57,328 --> 00:14:07,128
But, you know, I was in college in 2019.

274
00:14:07,128 --> 00:14:09,928
It was hard.

275
00:14:09,928 --> 00:14:14,928
It's been hard since 2018.

276
00:14:14,928 --> 00:14:17,928
I went to an educational training.

277
00:14:17,928 --> 00:14:20,928
I'll go back to what we talked about
earlier.

278
00:14:20,928 --> 00:14:24,928
You invited me to a music festival,
right?

279
00:14:24,928 --> 00:14:31,928
I thought it was unusual and it looked
fun, so I went.

280
00:14:31,928 --> 00:14:35,928
I've never been invited so I thought it
was unusual.

281
00:14:35,928 --> 00:14:38,928
I'm always embarrassed.

282
00:14:38,928 --> 00:14:44,832
I always said it like I was relaxed.

283
00:14:44,832 --> 00:14:48,832
But it was really fun.

284
00:14:48,832 --> 00:14:49,832
Really?

285
00:14:49,832 --> 00:14:52,832
At that time, we didn't have much time
to talk.

286
00:14:52,832 --> 00:14:53,832
That's right.

287
00:14:53,832 --> 00:14:59,832
So I was really relieved that I couldn't
say it properly.

288
00:14:59,832 --> 00:15:01,832
But it was really good.

289
00:15:01,832 --> 00:15:02,832
What?

290
00:15:02,832 --> 00:15:05,088
lol

291
00:15:05,088 --> 00:15:07,728
That's what I used to do.

292
00:15:07,728 --> 00:15:10,528
I used to watch it from time to time.

293
00:15:10,528 --> 00:15:11,728
I used to watch it when I was about to
debut,

294
00:15:11,728 --> 00:15:13,488
or when I was about to join the agency,

295
00:15:13,488 --> 00:15:15,088
or when I was about to become a
producer,

296
00:15:15,088 --> 00:15:17,088
or when I was watching the special
edition.

297
00:15:17,088 --> 00:15:19,088
I used to watch it occasionally.

298
00:15:19,088 --> 00:15:22,448
And it was a day of celebration.

299
00:15:22,448 --> 00:15:26,128
And you were the person who was there
from the beginning.

300
00:15:26,128 --> 00:15:29,008
I really ran through that.

301
00:15:29,008 --> 00:15:29,136
Thank you for watching.

302
00:15:29,136 --> 00:15:33,136
You don't always say such passionate
things.

303
00:15:33,136 --> 00:15:36,136
I want to say it.

304
00:15:36,136 --> 00:15:39,136
I don't know what to say.

305
00:15:39,136 --> 00:15:42,136
I'm sorry I didn't think of it at that
time.

306
00:15:42,136 --> 00:15:46,136
I think it happened and it comes
gradually.

307
00:15:46,136 --> 00:15:50,136
So our live was a little bit of a type?

308
00:15:50,136 --> 00:15:55,136
At that time, the music press was
already there the next day.

309
00:15:55,136 --> 00:15:57,360
I'm glad.

310
00:15:57,360 --> 00:16:01,360
I was able to get it back at a great
time.

311
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:04,360
Well, it's hard to...

312
00:16:04,360 --> 00:16:07,360
Especially my local friends...

313
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:08,360
Yeah.

314
00:16:08,360 --> 00:16:15,360
I'll show you how I've grown up.

315
00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:21,360
Even if I say my hometown, I was born
and raised in Tokyo.

316
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:24,000
I guess so.

317
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:28,000
I was worried that I wouldn't be able to
do it.

318
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:37,000
I was really nervous and anxious that
day.

319
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:44,000
But I was glad to see my friends
watching me like that.

320
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:51,216
I was happy to see them watching me from
the back of the dressing room.

321
00:16:51,216 --> 00:16:52,216
I'm glad.

322
00:16:52,216 --> 00:16:57,216
I sometimes watch them taking pictures
of me when I get home.

323
00:16:57,216 --> 00:16:59,216
Really?

324
00:16:59,216 --> 00:17:00,216
Yes.

325
00:17:01,216 --> 00:17:04,216
It's kind of embarrassing.

326
00:17:04,216 --> 00:17:06,216
I'm embarrassed.

327
00:17:06,216 --> 00:17:09,216
I thought I shouldn't have said that.

328
00:17:09,216 --> 00:17:15,216
I was given a good present, and I was
thinking about working hard from now on.

329
00:17:15,216 --> 00:17:20,496
I'm sorry I didn't say that.

330
00:17:20,496 --> 00:17:22,496
Thank you.

331
00:17:22,496 --> 00:17:26,496
I was talking about Nacchi in Ebichu,

332
00:17:26,496 --> 00:17:32,496
and I was so happy to introduce you to
my friend and best friend.

333
00:17:32,496 --> 00:17:34,496
I was so happy.

334
00:17:37,496 --> 00:17:40,496
I'm glad I was able to say that today.

335
00:17:40,496 --> 00:17:42,496
I'm glad. Thank you.

336
00:17:42,496 --> 00:17:44,496
I'll invite you again.

337
00:17:44,496 --> 00:17:46,496
Please visit again.

338
00:17:46,496 --> 00:17:48,496
At the end of the year.

339
00:17:48,496 --> 00:17:50,496
I see.

340
00:17:52,154 --> 00:17:59,754
I remember talking about the song, but I
also watched the first take.

341
00:17:59,754 --> 00:18:06,394
It's amazing. It's easy to understand
the song, so it's probably better.

342
00:18:06,394 --> 00:18:07,994
Elchu's song.

343
00:18:07,994 --> 00:18:09,194
Really?

344
00:18:09,194 --> 00:18:12,314
I also heard a new song.

345
00:18:12,314 --> 00:18:13,914
What was it?

346
00:18:13,914 --> 00:18:15,594
The one that's coming out from now?

347
00:18:15,594 --> 00:18:17,114
The one that's coming out from now?

348
00:18:17,114 --> 00:18:18,394
Any Time?

349
00:18:18,394 --> 00:18:19,754
Any Hour?

350
00:18:19,754 --> 00:18:20,880
Yeah, I heard it.

351
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:24,880
No way! We just heard it yesterday.

352
00:18:24,880 --> 00:18:27,880
Why are you asking me first?

353
00:18:27,880 --> 00:18:31,880
I got this information from the
information center.

354
00:18:31,880 --> 00:18:32,880
Really?

355
00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:34,880
I'm confident.

356
00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:38,880
It's nice. It's bright.

357
00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:42,880
It's a tropical mecca for nine people.

358
00:18:42,880 --> 00:18:45,648
Yeah, it's a tropical mecca.

359
00:18:45,648 --> 00:18:56,528
The cool thing I just heard was cool,
and I like the atmosphere of a little
older person in their 20s, but it's
bright and shiny.

360
00:18:56,528 --> 00:19:01,168
It's nice, isn't it? I feel like I'm
getting better.

361
00:19:01,168 --> 00:19:03,792
So, the other day, I was...

362
00:19:03,792 --> 00:19:08,832
九人シングル? 青い衣装のやつもさ。 エアホンライオットだ。

363
00:19:08,832 --> 00:19:14,952
あ、そうそうそう。あれもすごい明るくていいなって思うし。
あれだよね、青い衣装似合うよね。

364
00:19:14,952 --> 00:19:20,992
え、本当?初めて言われた。 本当に? 青いのいいなって思った。

365
00:19:20,992 --> 00:19:23,392
ずっと紫だったからさ。 あー。

366
00:19:23,392 --> 00:19:28,752
エビ中の衣装って色んな色があってさ、あんまりこう青...

367
00:19:28,752 --> 00:19:58,224
, 着る機会って割と自分が個人の時に青とかないから。 青いのもいいし、あとすごい
マニアックなんだけど、ショートブーツがお似合いだなって思った。
本当にマニアック。 いやでも本当ありがたいありがたい。
良くない時は良くないって言って。
良いと思ったら良いって言ってくれるの本当に無理し。
でも私もう大人になったからもうちょっと分け前って行きたい感じはしますよ。 そう?
うん。

368
00:19:58,224 --> 00:20:01,424
I see. I'm lonely.

369
00:20:01,424 --> 00:20:02,704
Really?

370
00:20:02,704 --> 00:20:04,704
I don't think it's bad in front of me.

371
00:20:04,704 --> 00:20:06,444
I might get hurt.

372
00:20:06,444 --> 00:20:09,324
No, it's okay. Your mental strength has
improved.

373
00:20:09,324 --> 00:20:10,524
Oh, really?

374
00:20:10,524 --> 00:20:11,784
Yeah.

375
00:20:11,784 --> 00:20:13,324
I can solve my own problems myself.

376
00:20:13,324 --> 00:20:15,324
You can solve it. You've grown up.

377
00:20:15,324 --> 00:20:16,324
Yeah.

378
00:20:16,324 --> 00:20:17,484
Oh, no.

379
00:20:17,484 --> 00:20:20,484
I was so young.

380
00:20:20,484 --> 00:20:24,204
It's okay. You should still be careful.

381
00:20:24,204 --> 00:20:24,884
Yeah.

382
00:20:24,884 --> 00:20:24,960
You should've thought of it differently.

383
00:20:24,960 --> 00:20:26,960
I want you to go. I understand.

384
00:20:31,260 --> 00:20:32,460
I'm soaked.

385
00:20:32,460 --> 00:20:33,960
That's good.

386
00:20:33,960 --> 00:20:35,460
That was fun.

387
00:20:35,460 --> 00:20:36,460
It was fun.

388
00:20:36,460 --> 00:20:39,960
I didn't know you could talk on the
phone for so long.

389
00:20:39,960 --> 00:20:41,460
I can talk.

390
00:20:41,460 --> 00:20:42,460
I can do it.

391
00:20:42,460 --> 00:20:43,460
I'll do it.

392
00:20:43,460 --> 00:20:45,960
Let's do it. Let's really do it.

393
00:20:45,960 --> 00:20:46,960
Let's do it.

394
00:20:46,960 --> 00:20:48,960
Let's talk. Really.

395
00:20:48,960 --> 00:20:49,960
I'm glad.

396
00:20:49,960 --> 00:20:51,460
I'm glad.

397
00:20:51,460 --> 00:20:54,480
It was fun.

398
00:20:54,480 --> 00:20:56,480
I'm getting sleepy.

399
00:20:56,480 --> 00:20:57,480
Are you sleepy?

400
00:20:57,480 --> 00:20:59,480
Aren't you too free?

401
00:20:59,480 --> 00:21:00,480
Thank you very much.

402
00:21:00,480 --> 00:21:02,480
Then I'm going to sleep.

403
00:21:02,480 --> 00:21:04,480
Good night.

404
00:21:04,480 --> 00:21:05,480
Good night.

405
00:21:05,480 --> 00:21:06,480
Bye bye.

406
00:21:06,480 --> 00:21:07,480
Bye bye.

407
00:21:07,480 --> 00:21:16,346
Good night.

408
00:21:16,346 --> 00:21:18,626
That's kind of me in a way.

409
00:21:22,010 --> 00:21:24,010
It's gone.

410
00:21:26,010 --> 00:21:28,010
I'm a little lonely.

411
00:21:28,010 --> 00:21:37,761
It was a very good time.
