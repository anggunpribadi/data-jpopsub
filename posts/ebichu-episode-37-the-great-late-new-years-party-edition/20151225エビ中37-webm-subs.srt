1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
New Year's special!

2
00:00:05,306 --> 00:00:07,306
Cheers!

3
00:00:08,306 --> 00:00:13,306
This week's Ebichutastas is Ebichutas'
5th year special!

4
00:00:14,306 --> 00:00:19,306
That legendary project is a one-night-
long revival!

5
00:00:19,306 --> 00:00:21,306
That's terrible!

6
00:00:23,306 --> 00:00:30,306
Furthermore, the Super Super Arena
University Gala was held the other day.

7
00:00:30,306 --> 00:00:35,306
Ebichutastas, start!

8
00:01:01,306 --> 00:01:05,306
Ebichutastas

9
00:01:06,306 --> 00:01:10,306
Ebichutastas

10
00:01:10,306 --> 00:01:16,538
Ebichutastas

11
00:01:16,538 --> 00:01:20,538
Add various things to private Ebisu
Middle School

12
00:01:20,538 --> 00:01:27,578
Ebisu Justus

13
00:01:27,578 --> 00:01:30,578
Sponsored by Holland.

14
00:01:39,962 --> 00:01:43,962
This episode of Ebichu Tastas started in
July

15
00:01:43,962 --> 00:01:47,962
We are going to cross the age together

16
00:01:47,962 --> 00:01:49,962
I want to sleep

17
00:01:49,962 --> 00:01:51,962
Wait a minute

18
00:01:51,962 --> 00:01:56,962
Today is December 24th, Christmas

19
00:01:56,962 --> 00:01:58,962
Is this a holiday?

20
00:01:58,962 --> 00:02:00,962
I came here for Christmas

21
00:02:00,962 --> 00:02:05,962
It's like a rock bed

22
00:02:05,962 --> 00:02:12,962
On Christmas night, Ebichu Tastas has a
big party

23
00:02:12,962 --> 00:02:17,962
Members will be excited in party mode

24
00:02:17,962 --> 00:02:29,786
Ebichu Tastas will start the party

25
00:02:29,786 --> 00:02:35,786
First, we would like to have this person
who is a shrimp lover take a toast

26
00:02:35,786 --> 00:02:37,786
Akiyama-san, please come in

27
00:02:38,786 --> 00:02:40,786
It's a sports day

28
00:02:46,786 --> 00:02:50,786
A shrimp lover serious sports day held
in Hachioji in October

29
00:02:50,786 --> 00:03:00,786
The guest of honor at that time was
Akiyama Katsuo-san from Hachioji Tourism
Association

30
00:03:02,786 --> 00:03:06,786
This time, it is a venue that has
nothing to do with Hachioji

31
00:03:06,786 --> 00:03:11,786
He rushed to us for a toast greeting
while busy

32
00:03:11,786 --> 00:03:13,786
Mayama-chan

33
00:03:13,786 --> 00:03:15,786
Thank you

34
00:03:15,786 --> 00:03:17,786
The color is

35
00:03:17,786 --> 00:03:22,786
The gift was a hand-made helmet with the
color of the member

36
00:03:22,786 --> 00:03:26,786
I wonder if this is necessary for a
toast

37
00:03:27,786 --> 00:03:30,786
What are you doing?

38
00:03:30,786 --> 00:03:33,786
You are the longest

39
00:03:33,786 --> 00:03:35,786
I'm a Toro

40
00:03:35,786 --> 00:03:38,786
You are really done with beer

41
00:03:38,786 --> 00:03:41,786
It's still the beginning

42
00:03:41,786 --> 00:03:44,786
We talked about Mr. Kakao

43
00:03:44,786 --> 00:03:49,786
Today, we are going to have a toast in
Hachioji Castle, a castle

44
00:03:49,786 --> 00:03:55,786
It will be a long story, so I will make
it short

45
00:03:55,786 --> 00:03:58,786
I don't want to have a toast

46
00:03:58,786 --> 00:04:01,786
I would like to have a toast in that
room

47
00:04:01,786 --> 00:04:03,786
That room?

48
00:04:03,786 --> 00:04:15,786
So, Akiyama-san original toast Hachioji
Castle version

49
00:04:15,786 --> 00:04:22,106
Cheers!

50
00:04:22,106 --> 00:04:27,106
Thus, the 5th Year party starts with the
strong Hachioji color.

51
00:04:29,106 --> 00:04:33,106
Next. Have you ever thought of something
else in 2015?

52
00:04:33,106 --> 00:04:36,106
We will produce what you have left on
the list.

53
00:04:38,106 --> 00:04:39,106
Nakashimaki!

54
00:04:40,106 --> 00:04:42,106
One person shabu-shabu and one person
yakiniku.

55
00:04:43,106 --> 00:04:48,106
I can do one person karaoke and one
person pasta and one person curry.

56
00:04:49,106 --> 00:04:51,106
But I couldn't do meat.

57
00:04:51,106 --> 00:04:53,106
You can go to the yakiniku by yourself

58
00:04:53,106 --> 00:04:55,106
You have the courage

59
00:04:55,106 --> 00:04:59,106
There is a school on weekdays so you
can't go

60
00:04:59,106 --> 00:05:02,106
You can go when you become a pro-chuu

61
00:05:02,106 --> 00:05:04,106
I will wait until I become a pro-chuu

62
00:05:04,106 --> 00:05:07,106
I will wait until next year

63
00:05:07,106 --> 00:05:09,106
Sorry, did you really think about being
a pro-chuu?

64
00:05:10,106 --> 00:05:12,106
You suddenly became a pro-chuu

65
00:05:12,106 --> 00:05:13,106
I knew it today

66
00:05:13,106 --> 00:05:15,106
Next is Yasumoto

67
00:05:15,106 --> 00:05:17,106
What did you do?

68
00:05:17,106 --> 00:05:21,106
I took a CD jacket in the center

69
00:05:21,106 --> 00:05:22,106
I see

70
00:05:22,106 --> 00:05:26,106
It was a single with a member in the
center

71
00:05:26,106 --> 00:05:28,106
There was a photo of the jacket

72
00:05:28,106 --> 00:05:31,106
I was very happy and my family was happy

73
00:05:31,106 --> 00:05:37,106
I was very happy to get a poster and
decorate the school

74
00:05:37,106 --> 00:05:42,106
I was in the center of the poster

75
00:05:42,106 --> 00:05:47,106
This is a arrow

76
00:05:47,106 --> 00:05:53,106
When a customer came to Ayaka's house,
my father introduced me to the photo

77
00:05:53,106 --> 00:05:55,106
I put an arrow on it

78
00:05:55,106 --> 00:05:58,106
It's also a photo of a ghost

79
00:05:58,106 --> 00:06:04,106
There are 8 people in the center so
there is no center

80
00:06:04,106 --> 00:06:07,106
Even if you try hard, you can't be in
the center

81
00:06:07,106 --> 00:06:12,106
I know there is no center, but I want to
be in the center

82
00:06:12,106 --> 00:06:14,106
I want to be happy again

83
00:06:15,106 --> 00:06:21,106
Yasumoto produce's Yasumoto Center
jacket photo shoot

84
00:06:21,106 --> 00:06:26,106
I want to be cute like a flower

85
00:06:26,106 --> 00:06:29,106
Like a pollen

86
00:06:29,106 --> 00:06:31,106
Like a pollen

87
00:06:31,106 --> 00:06:33,106
Like a pollen

88
00:06:33,106 --> 00:06:35,106
I want to be a pollen

89
00:06:35,106 --> 00:06:39,106
Yasumoto wants to be a pollen, not a
flower petal

90
00:06:39,106 --> 00:06:42,106
What kind of photo will it be?

91
00:06:42,106 --> 00:06:43,106
Like this?

92
00:06:43,106 --> 00:06:45,106
It's like this

93
00:06:45,106 --> 00:06:47,106
Like a flower

94
00:06:47,106 --> 00:06:49,106
Like a flower

95
00:06:49,106 --> 00:06:51,106
It's done

96
00:06:53,106 --> 00:06:55,106
Like this

97
00:06:55,106 --> 00:06:57,106
Open your hand

98
00:06:57,106 --> 00:06:59,106
Flower petal?

99
00:06:59,106 --> 00:07:05,106
I'm sorry to say this, but you should
put a flower petal on your coat

100
00:07:05,106 --> 00:07:07,106
Amazing

101
00:07:07,106 --> 00:07:10,626
It's a little hard but you should put it
like this

102
00:07:10,626 --> 00:07:12,626
Yes, yes, yes

103
00:07:13,626 --> 00:07:14,626
How is it?

104
00:07:14,626 --> 00:07:15,626
It's good

105
00:07:15,626 --> 00:07:17,626
You shouldn't do anything with pollen

106
00:07:18,626 --> 00:07:37,506
And so, the shooting of the

107
00:07:37,506 --> 00:07:40,506
movie, it's perfect

108
00:07:40,506 --> 00:07:45,506
Then, maybe, maybe, for the great person

109
00:07:45,506 --> 00:07:47,506
You should appeal to Yasumoto

110
00:07:47,506 --> 00:07:52,506
I wanted to be a mentor again

111
00:07:52,506 --> 00:07:56,506
Please

112
00:07:57,506 --> 00:07:59,506
Mr. Akiyama, can I ask you a favor?

113
00:07:59,506 --> 00:08:01,506
Yes, what kind of favor?

114
00:08:01,506 --> 00:08:03,506
Great person, great person of Star Dust

115
00:08:03,506 --> 00:08:07,506
Then, I will also

116
00:08:08,506 --> 00:08:11,506
In the place of Mr. Akimoto's father

117
00:08:11,506 --> 00:08:13,506
I will also ask you a favor

118
00:08:13,506 --> 00:08:15,506
Please

119
00:08:15,506 --> 00:08:17,506
Who is Mr. Akimoto?

120
00:08:17,506 --> 00:08:19,506
You are mixed with Mr. Akiyama

121
00:08:19,506 --> 00:08:21,506
Yasumoto

122
00:08:21,506 --> 00:08:24,506
If you stay as it is, Mr. Akiyama will
be the center jacket

123
00:08:24,506 --> 00:08:26,506
I wanted to say Akiyama

124
00:08:26,506 --> 00:08:30,506
Ebichu Fastas Daibou Nenkai Special

125
00:08:30,506 --> 00:08:32,506
Next is

126
00:08:32,506 --> 00:08:35,506
Nagaemariko presents N1 Gunpla

127
00:08:39,506 --> 00:08:43,506
After this, the legendary project is
resumed

128
00:08:43,506 --> 00:08:45,506
The Nenkai is very exciting

129
00:08:45,506 --> 00:08:47,506
But before that

130
00:08:47,506 --> 00:08:50,506
Sakura Ebis is in the front line

131
00:08:51,506 --> 00:08:56,506
Sakura Ebis was announced at the One Man
Live in January next year

132
00:08:56,506 --> 00:08:58,506
Before the announcement to the fans

133
00:08:58,506 --> 00:09:00,506
It was also passed on to the members

134
00:09:00,506 --> 00:09:02,506
Here is the situation at that time

135
00:09:02,506 --> 00:09:06,506
I'm very happy to do a live on January
17 next year

136
00:09:07,506 --> 00:09:10,506
Furthermore, big news

137
00:09:10,506 --> 00:09:12,506
Do you know the priority broadcast?

138
00:09:12,506 --> 00:09:14,506
There is an app called priority on the
smartphone

139
00:09:14,506 --> 00:09:18,506
One of them is the regular Sakura Ebis

140
00:09:19,506 --> 00:09:24,506
What! The first regular radio program of
Sakura Ebis starts

141
00:09:25,506 --> 00:09:26,506
I'm crying

142
00:09:26,506 --> 00:09:28,506
Are you crying?

143
00:09:28,506 --> 00:09:30,506
I was surprised

144
00:09:30,506 --> 00:09:34,506
This time, the first radio recording is
very advanced

145
00:09:34,506 --> 00:09:37,506
The recording pattern is a little public

146
00:09:37,506 --> 00:09:41,154
Hello everyone who listens to priority
on the smartphone

147
00:09:41,154 --> 00:09:44,154
We are Sakura Ebi's

148
00:09:44,154 --> 00:09:47,154
The way to the idol of Sakura Ebi's

149
00:09:47,154 --> 00:09:50,154
This is the first time to broadcast

150
00:09:51,154 --> 00:09:54,154
Our own radio show has started

151
00:09:54,154 --> 00:09:57,154
How is everyone? Are you nervous?

152
00:09:57,154 --> 00:09:59,154
Are you nervous?

153
00:10:00,154 --> 00:10:02,154
Only 5 people appear

154
00:10:02,154 --> 00:10:07,154
The talk is fun with the most advanced
member, Mizuha

155
00:10:07,154 --> 00:10:09,154
I understand

156
00:10:09,154 --> 00:10:13,154
However, Mizuha is in charge of the
progress

157
00:10:13,154 --> 00:10:15,154
Not yet

158
00:10:15,154 --> 00:10:17,154
Is it normal time?

159
00:10:17,154 --> 00:10:19,154
If you work harder

160
00:10:19,154 --> 00:10:22,154
I want to tell everyone's good things

161
00:10:22,154 --> 00:10:26,154
I want to be a middle school student and
watch the experiment

162
00:10:26,154 --> 00:10:29,154
First radio recording

163
00:10:29,154 --> 00:10:34,154
There is still a lot of food, but while
doing regular, it is a talk

164
00:10:34,154 --> 00:10:39,154
This radio program will be broadcast
from Monday to Monday

165
00:10:39,154 --> 00:10:42,154
Please check

166
00:10:42,154 --> 00:10:47,154
In the future, we will continue to stick
to Sakura Ebi's

167
00:10:50,154 --> 00:10:54,154
Nakaayama Riko presents N1 Grand Prix

168
00:10:57,154 --> 00:11:01,154
Legendary project that makes Nakayama
laugh

169
00:11:01,154 --> 00:11:03,154
N1 Grand Prix

170
00:11:03,154 --> 00:11:09,154
Last time, Matsuno won the game

171
00:11:11,154 --> 00:11:15,154
N1 knows, but N1 does not know

172
00:11:15,154 --> 00:11:18,154
If you think Nakayama is funny, give a
cucumber

173
00:11:18,154 --> 00:11:21,154
The number of cucumbers you get will
decide the winner

174
00:11:21,154 --> 00:11:24,154
Now, the person who wants to go

175
00:11:24,154 --> 00:11:26,154
Can't you read it?

176
00:11:27,154 --> 00:11:29,154
Kobayashi, good

177
00:11:29,154 --> 00:11:34,154
N1 Grand Prix, first Kobayashi's
challenge

178
00:11:34,154 --> 00:11:37,154
It's a story from when I was on the
train home

179
00:11:42,154 --> 00:11:44,154
I made a mistake on the train

180
00:11:48,154 --> 00:11:50,154
I have a good name

181
00:11:50,154 --> 00:11:52,154
I have a good name, so I want to say it

182
00:11:53,154 --> 00:11:55,154
Kobayashi, one step forward

183
00:11:55,154 --> 00:11:58,154
Good pace

184
00:11:59,154 --> 00:12:01,154
Hirota came

185
00:12:03,154 --> 00:12:07,154
Hirota's challenge that Nakayama's pot
is not known

186
00:12:07,154 --> 00:12:13,274
Please subscribe to the channel

187

188
00:12:15,274 --> 00:12:17,274
Oh!

189

What is this?

190
00:12:19,274 --> 00:12:21,274
What is this?

191
00:12:21,274 --> 00:12:23,274
Oh!

192
00:12:23,274 --> 00:12:25,274
Oh!

193
00:12:25,274 --> 00:12:27,274
All of a sudden!

194
00:12:27,274 --> 00:12:29,274
Let's go with the last one!

195
00:12:29,274 --> 00:12:31,274
I can't lose!

196
00:12:31,274 --> 00:12:33,274
Now, the last one!

197
00:12:33,274 --> 00:12:35,274
The thief!

198
00:12:35,274 --> 00:12:37,274
The thief cat in the movie!

199
00:12:37,274 --> 00:12:39,274
Oh, the same thing!

200
00:12:39,274 --> 00:12:41,274
Isn't it the same?

201
00:12:41,274 --> 00:12:43,274
That's terrible!

202
00:12:43,274 --> 00:12:45,274
That's terrible!

203
00:12:45,274 --> 00:12:47,274
Come on, come on!

204
00:12:47,274 --> 00:12:49,274
Please come back!

205
00:12:49,274 --> 00:12:51,274
Oh, no!

206
00:12:51,274 --> 00:12:53,274
It's a chance!

207
00:12:53,274 --> 00:12:55,274
The cloak!

208
00:12:55,274 --> 00:12:57,274
The cloak is flowing!

209
00:12:57,274 --> 00:12:59,274
What if you turn around?

210
00:12:59,274 --> 00:13:01,274
Oh, but...

211
00:13:01,274 --> 00:13:03,274
I'm losing!

212
00:13:03,274 --> 00:13:05,274
I'm losing!

213
00:13:05,274 --> 00:13:07,274
There was a point!

214
00:13:07,274 --> 00:13:09,274
Let's go!

215
00:13:09,274 --> 00:13:11,274
Go, Joo E!

216
00:13:11,274 --> 00:13:13,274
IPHTY48 kendara

217
00:13:13,274 --> 00:13:29,514
미 Visual

218
00:13:29,514 --> 00:13:32,514
This is the current situation

219
00:13:32,514 --> 00:13:35,514
So the second N1 Grand Prix

220
00:13:35,514 --> 00:13:40,514
The entertainer Chuu-ei who got 6
cucumbers won

221
00:13:40,514 --> 00:13:44,514
So what happened?

222
00:13:44,514 --> 00:13:46,514
Akiyama-san gave you the cucumber

223
00:13:46,514 --> 00:13:48,514
I gave it all

224
00:13:48,514 --> 00:13:49,514
What?

225
00:13:49,514 --> 00:13:51,514
That means

226
00:13:51,514 --> 00:13:52,514
The order has changed

227
00:13:52,514 --> 00:13:55,514
The winner is Akiyama-san

228
00:13:55,514 --> 00:13:58,514
The reverse point

229
00:13:58,514 --> 00:14:01,514
Akiyama-san

230
00:14:02,514 --> 00:14:05,514
By the way, what does this mean?

231
00:14:05,514 --> 00:14:08,514
I did my best

232
00:14:08,514 --> 00:14:12,514
I gave advice to buy the effort

233
00:14:12,514 --> 00:14:14,514
You gave advice

234
00:14:14,514 --> 00:14:17,514
That's the most important thing

235
00:14:18,514 --> 00:14:20,514
The second N1 Grand Prix

236
00:14:20,514 --> 00:14:25,514
Akiyama-san won the reverse point with
39 cucumbers

237
00:14:26,514 --> 00:14:28,514
After this

238
00:14:28,514 --> 00:14:30,514
The biggest school game in Ebichu

239
00:14:30,514 --> 00:14:34,514

We came to Saitama Super Arena

246
00:14:55,514 --> 00:14:57,514
We came

247
00:14:57,514 --> 00:15:00,930
I was waiting for this day

248
00:15:00,930 --> 00:15:02,930
I'm here

249
00:15:02,930 --> 00:15:04,930
You are here

250
00:15:04,930 --> 00:15:06,930
Do you know what day is today?

251
00:15:06,930 --> 00:15:08,930
What?

252
00:15:08,930 --> 00:15:10,930
Do you know what day is today?

253
00:15:10,930 --> 00:15:14,930

Ebichu

254

It's the birthday of King of Comedy
Kondo

259
00:15:26,930 --> 00:15:28,930
That's right

260
00:15:28,930 --> 00:15:30,930
I know you live around here

261
00:15:30,930 --> 00:15:32,930
No

262
00:15:32,930 --> 00:15:34,930
It's my birthday

263
00:15:34,930 --> 00:15:36,930
Sorry

264
00:15:36,930 --> 00:15:38,930
I forgot

265
00:15:38,930 --> 00:15:40,930
It's my birthday

266
00:15:40,930 --> 00:15:42,930
I'm not happy

267
00:15:42,930 --> 00:15:44,930
We are more excited than you

268
00:15:44,930 --> 00:15:46,930
Yes

269
00:15:46,930 --> 00:15:48,930
Let's go

270
00:15:48,930 --> 00:15:50,930
Who is it?

271
00:15:50,930 --> 00:15:52,930
Say something

272
00:15:52,930 --> 00:15:54,930

276
00:16:02,930 --> 00:16:04,930

The live show has finally begun

286
00:16:56,930 --> 00:17:06,930
It's going to be a big show

287
00:17:06,930 --> 00:17:36,430
Behind the scenes

288
00:17:36,430 --> 00:17:36,602
Thank you for watching!

289
00:17:36,602 --> 00:17:41,602
I want to see your amazing eyes

290
00:17:41,602 --> 00:17:46,602
I'll take over the world like a wind

291
00:17:46,602 --> 00:17:50,602
While waving my hand in the wind

292
00:17:50,602 --> 00:17:54,602
I'll shout out my heavy feelings

293
00:17:54,602 --> 00:18:15,602
Let's dance over ten thousand Vocaloids
Let's transform and visa

294
00:18:46,634 --> 00:18:48,634
Thank you for watching!

295
00:19:08,090 --> 00:19:17,190
Look, my tears immediately fell

296
00:19:29,978 --> 00:19:39,418
Thank you for watching!

297
00:19:39,482 --> 00:19:45,482
At the end of the live, the members
appeared on the truck and went around
the venue.

298
00:20:09,482 --> 00:20:12,482
Thank you for watching.

299
00:20:13,274 --> 00:20:17,274
The live performance is over, as they
become one with the family

300
00:20:21,274 --> 00:20:26,274
And they are going to perform live
performance after the live performance

301
00:20:28,274 --> 00:20:30,274
Come here, Ebichu

302
00:20:30,274 --> 00:20:32,274
Good job, good job

303
00:20:32,274 --> 00:20:34,274
Good job, everyone

304
00:20:36,274 --> 00:20:38,274
It was exciting

305
00:20:38,274 --> 00:20:45,274
Kaiki san said something like, what are
you going to talk with the members?

306
00:20:45,274 --> 00:20:51,274
I can't say it in words, so I can't say
it

307
00:20:51,274 --> 00:20:53,274
You're nervous now

308
00:20:54,274 --> 00:20:58,274
And we shook hands

309
00:20:58,274 --> 00:21:01,274
We all moved

310
00:21:01,274 --> 00:21:04,274
We shook hands but did anyone notice?

311
00:21:04,274 --> 00:21:06,274
Yes, we did

312
00:21:06,274 --> 00:21:08,274
The top

313
00:21:08,274 --> 00:21:10,274
Hoshino noticed

314
00:21:10,274 --> 00:21:12,274
These two were doing it in red

315
00:21:12,274 --> 00:21:13,274
Yes

316
00:21:13,274 --> 00:21:15,274
They noticed

317
00:21:15,274 --> 00:21:16,274
Really?

318
00:21:16,274 --> 00:21:20,274
I don't know who it was, but the staff
thought it was Siren

319
00:21:20,274 --> 00:21:23,274
They didn't notice

320
00:21:26,274 --> 00:21:28,274
So we'll do it again tomorrow

321
00:21:28,274 --> 00:21:29,274
Good luck

322
00:21:29,274 --> 00:21:31,274
Everyone, do it today

323
00:21:31,274 --> 00:21:33,274
Do it today

324
00:21:33,274 --> 00:21:35,274
And prepare for tomorrow

325
00:21:35,274 --> 00:21:37,274
Do it properly

326
00:21:37,274 --> 00:21:39,274
That's important

327
00:21:39,274 --> 00:21:41,274
I understand

328
00:21:41,274 --> 00:21:43,274
It's over

329
00:21:43,274 --> 00:21:45,274
Thank you

330
00:21:45,274 --> 00:21:47,274
Thank you

331
00:21:47,274 --> 00:21:51,274
So the first day is over

332
00:21:55,274 --> 00:21:57,274
December 13th

333
00:21:57,274 --> 00:22:01,274
The live performance was also very fast

334
00:22:01,274 --> 00:22:05,274
I'll do my best to put my gratitude on
the stage

335
00:22:05,274 --> 00:22:07,274
Here we go

336
00:22:07,274 --> 00:22:09,274
Where are we?

337
00:22:09,274 --> 00:22:11,274
Saiga

338
00:22:11,274 --> 00:22:12,274
We are

339
00:22:12,274 --> 00:22:13,274
We are

340
00:22:13,274 --> 00:22:14,274
We are

341
00:22:14,274 --> 00:22:15,274
We are

342
00:22:15,274 --> 00:22:16,274
We are

343
00:22:21,274 --> 00:22:23,274
Thank you

344
00:22:23,274 --> 00:22:31,274
Thank you

345
00:22:53,274 --> 00:23:01,274
Thank you

346
00:23:18,938 --> 00:23:21,938
I'll make you forget your past

347
00:23:21,938 --> 00:23:26,938
Love me, love me, smile it, smile it,
baby

348
00:23:26,938 --> 00:23:51,938
Because your smile will make the world
smile

349
00:23:56,938 --> 00:23:58,298
Thanks for watching!

350
00:23:58,298 --> 00:24:02,298
Over 20,000 people were invited in two
days

351
00:24:02,298 --> 00:24:05,298
It was the most amazing live performance
in the Eri-Chu market

352
00:24:08,298 --> 00:24:13,298
Thus, the last school performance this
year ended in a great success

353
00:24:13,298 --> 00:24:21,530
Thank you for your hard work

354
00:24:21,530 --> 00:24:23,530
How was it?

355
00:24:23,530 --> 00:24:25,530
It was great!

356
00:24:25,530 --> 00:24:29,530
I was really nervous.

357
00:24:29,530 --> 00:24:31,530
I was really nervous.

358
00:24:31,530 --> 00:24:33,530
I was really studying for two days.

359
00:24:33,530 --> 00:24:35,530
It was really fun.

360
00:24:35,530 --> 00:24:37,530
I'm not sad.

361
00:24:37,530 --> 00:24:39,530
I'm not sad.

362
00:24:39,530 --> 00:24:41,530
I'm going to grow old.

363
00:24:41,530 --> 00:24:43,530
Thank you so much.

364
00:24:43,530 --> 00:24:45,530
This was us, Shilt-E-Mishima.

365
00:24:45,530 --> 00:24:47,530
Bye-bye.

366
00:24:47,530 --> 00:24:49,530
Thank you.

367
00:24:49,530 --> 00:24:51,530
Thank you.

368
00:25:19,530 --> 00:25:21,530
Let me taste the cream!

369
00:25:49,530 --> 00:25:50,426
I'm going to regret this later.
