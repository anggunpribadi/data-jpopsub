This time, we talked about the fireworks that were going to be set off at the Munakata Festival in the previous location, so we decided to make some fireworks in a hurry, so R Fujimoto, Kiyama, and Ueda went to a fireworks factory in Kitakyushu City to make fireworks. Itâ€™s hereâœ¨

Decide on your own fireworks design and let's start making fireworks! ðŸŽ† What kind of design of fireworks could you make?

Fireworks produced by the performers will actually go off at the Munakata Festival on Sunday, November 5th! Look forward to itâ™ª
