WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:03.060
 More and more sinking

00:03.400 --> 00:11.240
 Let's begin the discussion

00:11.240 --> 00:12.940
 Oh, here we go.

00:12.940 --> 00:14.940
 Yes.

00:16.160 --> 00:18.160
 I tried to hold a rock.

00:18.160 --> 00:20.160
 She is laughing.

00:20.160 --> 00:22.160
 Please go ahead.

00:22.160 --> 00:24.160
 She is laughing.

00:24.160 --> 00:26.160
 She is laughing.

00:28.160 --> 00:30.160
 I can't take a picture of her.

00:30.160 --> 00:32.160
 She is laughing.

00:32.160 --> 00:34.160
 She is laughing.

00:36.160 --> 00:38.160
 I was surprised.

00:38.160 --> 00:40.160
 I was surprised.

00:40.160 --> 00:42.160
 I was surprised.

00:42.160 --> 00:44.160
 I was surprised.

00:44.160 --> 00:46.160
 She is laughing.

00:46.160 --> 00:48.160
 Please go ahead.

00:48.160 --> 00:50.160
 I want to meet a comedian.

00:50.160 --> 00:52.160
 She is laughing.

00:52.160 --> 00:54.160
 I want to meet a comedian.

00:54.160 --> 00:56.160
 I want to produce a person.

00:56.160 --> 00:58.160
 I want to do that.

00:58.160 --> 01:00.160
 I want to produce a person.

01:00.160 --> 01:02.160
 I want to do that.

01:02.160 --> 01:04.160
 I want to do a common sense test.

01:04.160 --> 01:06.160
 I want to know what kind of food I eat.

01:08.160 --> 01:10.160
 What?

01:10.160 --> 01:12.160
 I don't know.

01:12.160 --> 01:14.160
 I saw you eating curry with sauce.

01:14.160 --> 01:16.160
 I see.

01:18.160 --> 01:20.160
 I want to cook without a recipe.

01:20.160 --> 01:22.160
 I see.

01:22.160 --> 01:24.160
 I can't do that.

01:24.160 --> 01:26.160
 I can't do that.

01:26.160 --> 01:28.160
 It looks fun.

01:28.160 --> 01:30.160
 I want to cook a foreign dish.

01:30.160 --> 01:32.160
 I don't know.

01:32.160 --> 01:34.160
 I don't know.

01:36.160 --> 01:38.160
 I want to drive a Mercedes-Benz.

01:38.160 --> 01:40.160
 That's good.

01:40.160 --> 01:42.160
 I want to drive a Lamborghini or MINI
Cooper.

01:44.160 --> 01:46.160
 I want to watch it off.

01:46.160 --> 01:48.160
 That's good.

01:48.160 --> 01:50.160
 The prank.

01:50.160 --> 01:54.160
 If you tell me your plan today,

01:54.160 --> 01:56.160
 I will go with you.

01:56.160 --> 01:58.160
 That's interesting.

01:58.160 --> 02:00.160
 I wonder where you go.

02:00.160 --> 02:02.160
 I will go with you.

02:02.160 --> 02:04.160
 I want to be a professional wrestler.

02:04.160 --> 02:06.160
 That sounds interesting.

02:06.160 --> 02:08.160
 That sounds interesting.

02:08.160 --> 02:11.540
 I tilt all the cameras this means

02:11.740 --> 02:13.380
 Do it pivot

02:13.380 --> 02:15.540
 Then I tilt it

02:15.540 --> 02:17.680
 I will go to shoot a video of a swing
eating spicy raw beef with from now on.

02:17.680 --> 02:19.680
 I want to do it.

02:19.680 --> 02:21.680
 I want to play a youth.

02:21.680 --> 02:23.680
 Thank you for the meal.

02:23.680 --> 02:25.680
 Thank you for the meal.

02:25.680 --> 02:27.680
 It was delicious.

02:27.680 --> 02:29.680
 It was delicious.

02:31.680 --> 02:33.680
 Next, they are going to the beach.

02:33.680 --> 02:35.680
 They are going to the beach.

02:37.680 --> 02:39.680
 I have to be careful not to fall.

02:39.680 --> 02:56.680

02:57.114 --> 03:00.714
 Got a lot!?

03:14.042 --> 03:16.042
 I'm sweating.

03:19.042 --> 03:20.042
 It's a good design.

03:21.042 --> 03:23.042
 I'm going to eat a delicious one.

03:25.042 --> 03:26.042
 It's amazing.

03:26.042 --> 03:27.042
 It's amazing.

03:29.042 --> 03:30.042
 It's a big one.

03:30.042 --> 03:31.042
 It's a big one.

03:33.042 --> 03:34.042
 It's amazing.

03:35.042 --> 03:36.042
 I'm going to eat it.

03:36.042 --> 03:37.042
 It's really big.

03:39.042 --> 03:40.042
 It's big.

03:40.042 --> 03:41.042
 It's amazing.

03:41.042 --> 03:45.042
 Thank you for watching. Please

03:45.402 --> 03:48.702
 So beautiful!

03:49.442 --> 03:52.222
 Wow!

03:54.182 --> 03:58.442
 Look at my acting skills!

03:58.442 --> 04:00.322
 Wait a minute, stop!

04:08.202 --> 04:11.402
 What did you come here to do?

04:11.402 --> 04:14.352
 Naturally secret

04:14.352 --> 04:16.352
 Please subscribe to our channel!

04:18.128 --> 04:20.128
 This is Yasumori Farm!

04:22.128 --> 04:28.128
 The reason why I'm here is because I
want to grow my own vegetables!

04:30.128 --> 04:35.128
 Wakarin is working hard every day, so I
wanted to grow my own vegetables.

04:36.128 --> 04:37.128
 I bought this much.

04:37.128 --> 04:46.704
 I'm looking forward to seeing how
Wakarin reacts to this.

04:47.704 --> 04:53.704
 I need to color the grass in Yasumori
Farm.

04:55.704 --> 04:57.704
 I'm going to use red daikon.

05:00.704 --> 05:03.704
 I'm going to do my best as a beginner.

05:06.704 --> 05:10.704
 I couldn't make shoes with this
material, so I changed to long shoes.

05:11.704 --> 05:12.704
 I'm sorry for borrowing this.

05:12.704 --> 05:15.704
 I'm going to cut this.

05:17.704 --> 05:20.704
 I want to make Wakarin smile.

05:21.704 --> 05:22.704
 I'm always doing my best.

05:22.704 --> 05:27.472
 I'm going to water it.

05:28.472 --> 05:29.472
 What?

05:30.472 --> 05:31.472
 Oh, thank God.

05:34.472 --> 05:36.472
 I didn't know that I felt like this.

05:37.472 --> 05:39.472
 It's a support for Fujitani.

05:39.472 --> 05:44.472
 I didn't know that.

05:45.800 --> 05:46.800
 Wow.

05:46.800 --> 05:48.800
 Is this OK?

05:48.800 --> 05:49.800
 I don't know.

05:50.800 --> 05:51.800
 What should I do?

05:53.800 --> 05:54.800
 What should I do?

05:58.800 --> 05:59.800
 I'm scared.

06:02.800 --> 06:03.800
 I'll do my best.

06:05.800 --> 06:07.800
 Do you do this every day?

06:08.800 --> 06:09.800
 You are good.

06:09.800 --> 06:10.800
 I'm scared.

06:14.256 --> 06:16.256
 I made a hole.

06:16.256 --> 06:18.256
 I'll put 5 grains.

06:18.256 --> 06:20.256
 I'm scared.

06:20.256 --> 06:22.256
 I'm scared.

06:24.256 --> 06:26.256
 How can I plant this?

06:26.256 --> 06:33.040
 Please subscribe to my channel.

06:34.040 --> 06:36.040
 Do you want more?

06:36.040 --> 06:38.040
 How much should I put?

06:39.040 --> 06:41.040
 It's difficult. I don't know anything.

06:41.040 --> 06:43.040
 You can put as much as you like.

06:43.040 --> 06:45.040
 Can I put all?

06:45.040 --> 06:47.040
 Put as much as you like.

06:47.040 --> 06:53.040
 Thank you for watching.

06:53.338 --> 06:55.338
 Wow!

06:56.338 --> 06:58.338
 Seeds are like this.

07:02.338 --> 07:06.338
 I didn't know cosmos is like this.

07:06.338 --> 07:15.344
 Thank you for watching my video! Please
subscribe and like!

07:16.344 --> 07:20.344
 I'm a person who puts everything in the
bag.

07:20.344 --> 07:22.344
 I put everything in the bag.

07:22.344 --> 07:24.344
 Because I'm a shrimp type.

07:26.344 --> 07:28.344
 This is fun!

07:28.344 --> 07:39.344
 Thank you for watching my video!

07:39.360 --> 07:41.360
 I wish you grow up a lot!

07:43.360 --> 07:44.360
 Is it OK?

07:44.360 --> 07:45.360
 Is it OK, Alinko?

07:45.360 --> 07:47.360
 Alinko!

07:47.360 --> 07:49.360
 I love you!

07:51.648 --> 07:53.648
 I'm going to do it.

07:53.648 --> 07:55.648
 Oh, no!

07:55.648 --> 07:57.648
 What should I do?

07:57.648 --> 07:59.648
 I'm going to be found out.

07:59.648 --> 08:01.648
 I'm going to be found out.

08:01.648 --> 08:03.648
 Wait.

08:03.648 --> 08:05.648
 I don't want to do it.

08:05.648 --> 08:07.648
 If I fall down on the road,

08:07.648 --> 08:09.648
 I'm going to be found out.

08:09.648 --> 08:11.648
 I don't want to do it.

08:11.648 --> 08:13.648
 I'm sad.

08:13.648 --> 08:15.648
 I'm going to be found out.

08:15.648 --> 08:17.648
 What?

08:17.648 --> 08:19.648
 I'm going to be found out.

08:21.210 --> 08:24.210
 Can you take care of it while I'm gone?

08:24.210 --> 08:28.210
 I feel like I'm going to die.

08:28.210 --> 08:29.210
 Is this a bird's nest?

08:29.210 --> 08:32.210
 It's better to plant it as it is.

08:32.210 --> 08:34.210
 Is this a bird's nest?

08:34.210 --> 08:36.210
 I just pulled it out.

08:36.210 --> 08:38.210
 Just plant it as it is.

08:38.210 --> 08:46.210
 I just pulled it out.

08:49.114 --> 08:52.114
 But there are birds coming, so maybe...

08:52.114 --> 08:55.114
 Did it drop the seed?

08:55.114 --> 08:57.114
 Let's grow it.

08:57.114 --> 08:58.114
 Yes.

08:58.114 --> 08:59.114
 Wow!

08:59.114 --> 09:01.114
 The miracle of the 6th anniversary.

09:01.114 --> 09:03.114
 Life has come to life.

09:03.114 --> 09:05.114
 Maybe it's a peach seedling.

09:05.114 --> 09:07.114
 I'm impressed.

09:07.114 --> 09:08.114
 Wow!

09:08.114 --> 09:11.888
 It was a peach seedling.

09:12.888 --> 09:14.888
 I'm not good at Korean.

09:15.888 --> 09:16.888
 Oh, no!

09:20.888 --> 09:21.888
 What are you doing?

09:21.888 --> 09:22.888
 I put it in the container.

09:25.888 --> 09:26.888
 I'm not going to do it.

09:26.888 --> 09:27.888
 I don't know.

09:28.888 --> 09:30.888
 I don't know what to do with the
container.

09:31.888 --> 09:35.888
 You can bring a cola that doesn't fit
in the container.

09:35.888 --> 09:36.888
 You can do it in front of me.

09:36.888 --> 09:37.888
 I want to do it.

09:37.888 --> 09:38.888
 I want to do it.

09:38.888 --> 09:39.888
 I'll change the plan.

09:41.888 --> 09:42.888
 I'll change the plan.

09:42.888 --> 09:43.888
 Let's go.

09:45.888 --> 09:46.888
 OK!

09:46.888 --> 09:49.968
 See you next time!

09:50.968 --> 09:52.968
 Stop!

09:52.968 --> 10:01.850
 Please subscribe to my channel!

10:01.850 --> 10:03.850
 That's all.

10:03.850 --> 10:05.850
 That's all.

10:05.850 --> 10:07.850
 Good morning.

10:07.850 --> 10:09.850
 You just put it in, didn't you?

10:09.850 --> 10:11.850
 I did.

10:11.850 --> 10:13.850
 I was surprised.

10:13.850 --> 10:15.850
 That's all.

10:15.850 --> 10:17.850
 That's all for today.

10:17.850 --> 10:19.850
 Congratulations.

10:19.850 --> 10:21.850
 Thank you.

10:21.850 --> 10:23.850
 Good job.

10:23.850 --> 10:25.850
 I was surprised.

10:25.850 --> 10:27.850
 I'm sticky.

10:27.850 --> 10:29.850
 I'm sticky.

10:29.850 --> 10:31.632
 Yay!

10:32.632 --> 10:35.632
 Today, we are going to eat insects
deliciously.

10:37.632 --> 10:39.632
 Who came up with this idea?

10:39.632 --> 10:41.632
 Who came up with this idea?

10:41.632 --> 10:42.632
 Why?

10:43.632 --> 10:44.632
 You are right.

10:44.632 --> 10:45.632
 I don't know.

10:48.040 --> 10:50.040
 We are in E-BEANS.

10:51.040 --> 10:54.040
 There is a insect vending machine
behind E-BEANS.

10:55.040 --> 10:57.040
 Who is that?

10:58.040 --> 11:01.040
 I love E-BEANS, but I can't forgive
this.

11:02.040 --> 11:04.040
 Who did you choose?

11:05.040 --> 11:08.040
 We bought some insects from there.

11:09.040 --> 11:12.040
 I thought you would not like it if we
just ate.

11:12.040 --> 11:18.040
 We will think about how to eat insects
deliciously.

11:19.040 --> 11:21.040
 There are many ways.

11:22.040 --> 11:24.040
 If you like sweet things, you can put
some sweet things on it.

11:25.040 --> 11:27.040
 Amatao, it's your turn.

11:28.040 --> 11:30.040
 You can do it.

11:31.040 --> 11:35.040
 I have been with you for 6 years.

11:36.040 --> 11:38.040
 You can eat a lot.

11:38.040 --> 11:40.040
 I'm sorry.

11:41.040 --> 11:43.040
 You are the worst.

11:44.040 --> 11:47.040
 Which do you like, sweet or salty?

11:48.040 --> 11:50.040
 I like salty.

11:51.040 --> 11:53.040
 You can choose.

11:54.040 --> 11:56.040
 Who do you like?

11:57.040 --> 11:59.040
 I like sweet.

12:00.040 --> 12:02.040
 You are right.

12:03.040 --> 12:05.040
 I can't see it.

12:05.040 --> 12:07.040
 I'm surprised.

12:08.040 --> 12:10.040
 Please hold it.

12:11.040 --> 12:13.040
 You are a good person.

12:14.040 --> 12:16.040
 My hand slipped.

12:17.040 --> 12:19.040
 You are amazing.

12:21.040 --> 12:23.040
 My hand slipped.

12:24.040 --> 12:26.040
 You are funny.

12:27.040 --> 12:29.040
 You are funny.

12:30.040 --> 12:32.040
 I chose.

12:32.040 --> 12:35.040
 It contains 28g of protein.

12:36.040 --> 12:37.040
 It's amazing.

12:38.040 --> 12:40.040
 It's good for trainers.

12:41.040 --> 12:43.040
 Insects are nutritious.

12:43.040 --> 12:47.776
 Let's eat ice cream.

12:47.776 --> 12:49.776
 We're going back.
