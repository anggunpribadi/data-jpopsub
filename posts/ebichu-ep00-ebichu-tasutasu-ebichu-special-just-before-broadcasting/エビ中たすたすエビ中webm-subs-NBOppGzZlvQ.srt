1
00:00:00,442 --> 00:00:04,442
It's morning time. We are Ebichu
University.

2
00:00:05,442 --> 00:00:06,442
It's started.

3
00:00:07,442 --> 00:00:10,442
Ebichu's new program, Ebichu Tastasuga.

4
00:00:11,442 --> 00:00:16,442
Idol group, Ebichu University's new
program, Ebichu Tastasuga.

5
00:00:16,442 --> 00:00:18,442
It starts next week.

6
00:00:18,442 --> 00:00:26,906
Tonight's special is right before that.

7
00:00:55,296 --> 00:00:58,296
berseker

8
00:00:58,296 --> 00:01:00,756
World's Most Al pipeline

9
00:01:00,756 --> 00:01:13,976
New P

10
00:01:13,976 --> 00:01:17,976
This program is brought to you by these
sponsors.

11
00:01:27,482 --> 00:01:41,482
A new program called Ebichu Pasta is a
variety of experiments that idols
collaborate with various things to
create scientific reactions.

12
00:01:41,482 --> 00:01:47,482
The program is broadcast by the members
of Ebichu Junior High School and
supporters.

13
00:01:47,482 --> 00:01:54,688
In addition, mysterious guests appear
every time.

14
00:01:54,688 --> 00:01:57,688
What is the theme of the first time?

15
00:01:57,688 --> 00:01:59,688
What do you add?

16
00:01:59,688 --> 00:02:01,688
I add a switch.

17
00:02:02,688 --> 00:02:04,688
I want to push it.

18
00:02:04,688 --> 00:02:06,688
Let's push it.

19
00:02:06,688 --> 00:02:08,688
I'm happy.

20
00:02:08,688 --> 00:02:10,688
I'm happy.

21
00:02:10,688 --> 00:02:12,688
Is it okay if it doesn't stick to the
room?

22
00:02:12,688 --> 00:02:16,256
The end.

23
00:02:16,256 --> 00:02:21,256
What is the meaning of the Ebitu test
switch?

24
00:02:22,256 --> 00:02:25,256
Before that, this time is a special
opportunity.

25
00:02:27,256 --> 00:02:32,256
I asked the members what they want to
add to Ebitu in this program.

26
00:02:33,256 --> 00:02:36,256
First of all, the number 6, Aika Hirota.

27
00:02:37,256 --> 00:02:40,256
I am very interested in railways.

28
00:02:40,256 --> 00:02:42,256
I like railways.

29
00:02:42,256 --> 00:02:47,256
I am the only one who likes railways in
Ebitu.

30
00:02:47,256 --> 00:02:50,256
I want to make the best of everyone.

31
00:02:50,256 --> 00:02:56,256
I want to go to the factory of railways
with everyone.

32
00:02:56,256 --> 00:03:01,808
Next is the number 11, Kobayashi Kahoa.

33
00:03:01,808 --> 00:03:13,808
The reason why I wanted to add this is
because Nagariboshi-san always has a
funny laugh.

34
00:03:13,808 --> 00:03:17,808
So I wanted to add a skit with him.

35
00:03:17,808 --> 00:03:21,808
The reason why she wanted to add a skit
with Ebichu is...

36
00:03:21,808 --> 00:03:31,808
I'm not used to variety shows, so I
always slip.

37
00:03:31,808 --> 00:03:40,808
So if I have a chance to do a skit with
Nagariboshi-san, I want to be funny.

38
00:03:40,808 --> 00:03:45,808
An idol with a comedian's gaze, will
Ebichu skit come true?

39
00:03:45,808 --> 00:03:51,808
The number 12, the youngest, Riko
Nakayama...

40
00:03:51,808 --> 00:03:56,808
I want to play a game with everyone.

41
00:03:56,808 --> 00:04:04,808
I want to do a game where I can make a
face of the person who hit the dodge
ball.

42
00:04:04,808 --> 00:04:09,312
I want to play anyway.

43
00:04:09,312 --> 00:04:15,312
Next, the oldest member of the group,
Rika Mayama.

44
00:04:16,312 --> 00:04:19,312
I want to cook.

45
00:04:20,312 --> 00:04:24,312
I think it would be fun to have a
cooking battle.

46
00:04:25,312 --> 00:04:27,312
I can eat.

47
00:04:28,312 --> 00:04:29,312
I can eat.

48
00:04:29,312 --> 00:04:33,312
If there is a reward, everyone will be
serious.

49
00:04:34,312 --> 00:04:36,312
Mayama wants to cook.

50
00:04:36,312 --> 00:04:39,312
Next, the two friends of the shrimp.

51
00:04:40,312 --> 00:04:42,312
The number 7, Hoshina Mirei.

52
00:04:43,312 --> 00:04:45,312
The number 9, Rina Matsuno.

53
00:04:47,312 --> 00:04:50,312
I like to eat.

54
00:04:51,312 --> 00:04:54,312
I want to have a barbecue.

55
00:04:55,312 --> 00:04:57,312
I like nature, so I want to go hiking.

56
00:04:58,312 --> 00:05:01,312
I like fruits.

57
00:05:02,312 --> 00:05:04,312
I want to go to a strawberry bar with a
winer.

58
00:05:04,312 --> 00:05:09,312
I want to eat other fruits.

59
00:05:10,312 --> 00:05:13,312
I want to be healthy with a winer.

60
00:05:14,312 --> 00:05:16,312
I think it would be fun.

61
00:05:16,312 --> 00:05:24,208
The members who want to eat something
continue.

62
00:05:24,208 --> 00:05:31,208
The 5th member, Ayaka Yasugoto, is
making a shocking statement.

63
00:05:33,208 --> 00:05:49,208
I like comedians, so if I add comedians
other than Nagareboshi, I think everyone
will laugh.

64
00:05:49,208 --> 00:05:55,208
She has been rejecting the cast of
Nagareboshi since the broadcast started.

65
00:05:56,208 --> 00:05:57,208
Furthermore,

66
00:05:58,208 --> 00:06:09,208
I have always admired Oriental Radio. I
like their rhythmical and good-tempo
comedy.

67
00:06:09,208 --> 00:06:13,536
I want to show them.

68
00:06:13,536 --> 00:06:16,536
Is there a casting change?

69
00:06:18,536 --> 00:06:24,536
And I also asked Hinata Tashiwagi, who
was the first to see the movie.

70
00:06:24,536 --> 00:06:27,536
Direct interview during the movie
shooting.

71
00:06:27,536 --> 00:06:29,536
Good morning.

72
00:06:29,536 --> 00:06:37,744
What does Hinata Tashiwagi want to show?

73
00:06:37,744 --> 00:06:45,344
I want to hold a cultural festival.

74
00:06:46,144 --> 00:06:52,144
Riko likes cotton candy, so I want to
eat cotton candy Riko makes.

75
00:06:52,344 --> 00:06:54,144
Rina likes takoyaki.

76
00:06:54,144 --> 00:06:58,744
I want to do what I want to do with all
the members.

77
00:06:58,944 --> 00:07:05,544
I hope it will be a fun cultural
festival.

78
00:07:05,544 --> 00:07:10,544
I heard a lot of things, but I want to
eat something.

79
00:07:11,544 --> 00:07:15,544
This is the end of the show.

80
00:07:16,544 --> 00:07:23,544
First of all, let me introduce the idol
group.

81
00:07:24,544 --> 00:07:29,544
Please enjoy the video.

82
00:07:29,544 --> 00:07:35,544
The concept of the group is to be an
eternal junior high school student.

83
00:07:35,544 --> 00:07:40,752
The average age is 15.8 years old.

84
00:07:40,752 --> 00:07:44,752
The formation was on August 4, 2009.

85
00:07:45,752 --> 00:07:48,752
This is a picture of the early days of
Ebi-chuu.

86
00:07:49,752 --> 00:07:52,752
Mayamato Yasumoto is a member from this
time.

87
00:07:54,752 --> 00:07:59,752
Please see the very valuable live video
of the Indies era.

88
00:08:02,752 --> 00:08:05,752
We are CJ Echigoku.

89
00:08:05,752 --> 00:08:09,856
Thank you.

90
00:08:09,856 --> 00:08:37,016
The

91
00:08:37,016 --> 00:08:39,016
He continued his activities on his own

92
00:08:47,770 --> 00:08:53,770
And after 3 years of being formed, their
activities are green and they made their
major debut

93
00:09:00,570 --> 00:09:10,570
Oricon Daily Rank 2nd, Weekly Rank 7th,
and Cinderella who played the role of
Haruki made her debut single and won the
top prize.

94
00:09:20,570 --> 00:09:25,570
Now, let's take a look at the single
songs of the Eri-Chu so far.

95
00:09:25,570 --> 00:09:37,434
Eri-Chu Single History

96
00:09:37,434 --> 00:09:39,434
Thank you for watching!

97
00:09:45,946 --> 00:09:53,946

00:09:53,946 --> 00:09:58,946
Ume's first daily ranking 1st place

99
00:09:58,946 --> 00:10:16,794
Ume's first daily ranking 1st place

100
00:10:16,794 --> 00:10:22,794
This is the 5th single, the PV of the
unidentified junior high school student
X.

101
00:10:22,794 --> 00:10:25,794
The director is Sekine Tsukomu.

102
00:10:25,794 --> 00:10:33,200
The unidentified junior high school
student X.

103
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:39,200
Let's dance for the time being

104
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:45,200
Maybe I'm unidentified junior high
school student

105
00:10:48,200 --> 00:10:51,200
The sixth single Butter Cry Effect

106
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:54,200
It became the first single in the
current member formation

107
00:10:54,200 --> 00:10:56,200
When the wish comes true

108
00:10:56,200 --> 00:10:59,200
A miracle of birth and death

109
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:02,200
I'm dying

110
00:11:02,200 --> 00:11:03,136
I fell in love

111
00:11:03,136 --> 00:11:07,136
The momentum of Ebichu never stops

112
00:11:07,136 --> 00:11:11,136
The 7th single, Haikateki, is a big hit

113
00:11:12,136 --> 00:11:18,136
Furthermore, Ebichu's biggest charm is
the live activities called Gakugeikai

114
00:11:18,136 --> 00:11:28,592
After this, the live video will be
released

115
00:11:28,592 --> 00:11:33,592
The new show of private Ebisu junior
high school, Ebichu Tastas

116
00:11:33,592 --> 00:11:39,592
We will introduce their charm in the
next week's broadcast

117
00:11:39,592 --> 00:11:43,592
The biggest attraction is the live
called Bakugoukaikko

118
00:11:43,592 --> 00:11:50,320
In December 2013, the one-man live will
be held at Saitama Super Arena

119
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:53,320
It has been one year and seven months
since the major debut

120
00:11:53,320 --> 00:12:00,320
At that time, the Japanese artist was
the fastest to perform at Saitama Super
Arena

121
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:06,682
He captured the attention at the cool
stage with a great performance

122
00:12:06,682 --> 00:12:14,682
Furthermore, in 2014, they held a solo
concert at the Nippon Budokan and
attracted 10,000 people.

123
00:12:35,930 --> 00:12:40,930
In summer, they held a solo outdoor live
with a theme of a long-distance trip.

124
00:12:40,930 --> 00:12:45,930
During the show, they held a family
trip.

125
00:12:50,930 --> 00:12:53,930
They performed with a lot of water and
fire.

126
00:12:53,930 --> 00:13:06,930
The members ran through the outdoor live
with a group of fans.

127
00:13:06,970 --> 00:13:08,970
At the end of the concert...

128
00:13:21,786 --> 00:13:25,786
I wanted to see the fireworks.

129
00:13:30,298 --> 00:13:33,298
The members are also impressed by this.

130
00:13:33,298 --> 00:13:38,298
The special feature of the Ebichu
Gakugei is to enjoy the live with the
fans.

131
00:13:38,298 --> 00:13:53,818
The event in the summer has been a great
success.

132
00:13:53,818 --> 00:13:59,818
And in the fall, they will hold a one-
man live at Yokohama Arena.

133
00:13:59,818 --> 00:14:12,336
And in January this year...

134
00:14:12,336 --> 00:14:15,336
Ebichu has come to Taiwan!

135
00:14:16,336 --> 00:14:19,336
This is Ebichu's first time going
overseas.

136
00:14:19,336 --> 00:14:24,336
Please watch the special Taiwan version
of Cinderella, the hunting contract.

137
00:14:24,336 --> 00:14:35,312
We'll do our best!

138
00:14:35,312 --> 00:14:36,452
All the best!

139
00:14:36,392 --> 00:15:02,092

Yeah!

147
00:16:36,826 --> 00:16:42,826
And this year's EbiTuber is also full of
energy!

148
00:16:42,826 --> 00:17:00,826
The second album, Kimpachi, released in
January, was a huge hit on the Oricon
chart.

149
00:17:12,826 --> 00:17:14,170
The third album, Kimpachi, was a huge
hit on the Oricon chart.

150
00:17:14,170 --> 00:17:17,670
Please call us on a new journey

151
00:17:17,670 --> 00:17:20,670
We are Golden Ace

152
00:17:20,670 --> 00:17:23,170
We are Golden Ace

153
00:17:23,170 --> 00:17:30,032
Next is Shiritaya Bish Chukaku!

154
00:17:30,032 --> 00:17:34,032
Shiritaya Ebichu Chukaku is challenging
again!

155
00:17:34,032 --> 00:17:36,032
The new program Ebichu Tastas!

156
00:17:36,032 --> 00:17:38,032
Finally, the next week starts!

157
00:17:40,032 --> 00:17:44,032
This time, we will show you a little bit
of that!

158
00:17:46,032 --> 00:17:52,032
This is the first time, so I will turn
on everyone's motivation switch!

159
00:17:52,032 --> 00:17:54,032
I will turn on the switch!

160
00:17:54,032 --> 00:17:58,032
Nakayama!

161
00:17:58,272 --> 00:18:00,272
Don't run away!

162
00:18:00,272 --> 00:18:02,272
Don't run away in the open!

163
00:18:02,272 --> 00:18:07,272
Nakayama, press this switch and turn on
everyone's motivation!

164
00:18:08,272 --> 00:18:10,272
If you press this, everyone will turn
on, right?

165
00:18:10,272 --> 00:18:11,272
Yes!

166
00:18:11,272 --> 00:18:19,120
The outcome is the power of НSR!

167
00:18:19,120 --> 00:18:25,120
The opening character, the member's
maximum freedom!

誰かピアノ弾ける?

172
00:18:40,288 --> 00:18:41,288
誰かピアノ弾ける子

173
00:18:41,288 --> 00:18:42,288
あ、かもかも

174
00:18:42,288 --> 00:18:44,288
少しだけ弾けない

175
00:18:44,288 --> 00:18:46,288
少しだけ弾けるのやってみなよ

176
00:18:46,288 --> 00:18:47,288
何?

177
00:18:47,288 --> 00:18:48,288
何?

178
00:18:48,288 --> 00:18:49,288
目が眩いちゃった

179
00:18:49,288 --> 00:19:04,288
終了

180
00:19:04,288 --> 00:19:07,288
エビ中にスイッチを足したら一体どうなる?

181
00:19:07,288 --> 00:19:11,472
次回 新しいミニコーナーもお楽しみに

182
00:19:12,352 --> 00:19:17,352
This January, the research student
recruitment of Ebi-Chu was announced.

183
00:19:17,352 --> 00:19:20,352
The name is Sakura Ebiz.

184
00:19:21,352 --> 00:19:24,352
Currently, auditions are going on in
various places.

185
00:19:24,352 --> 00:19:29,352
In the program, the information about
the Sakura Ebiz audition will be
released one after another.

186
00:19:30,352 --> 00:19:35,352
Furthermore, the new project of Ebi-Chu
will also be initiated.

187
00:19:36,352 --> 00:19:40,352
There is a serious report for everyone.

188
00:19:40,352 --> 00:19:47,352
The project to create a game of Ebi-Chu
is in progress in 2015.

189
00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:55,600
What is the shock of Ebi-Chu game
development?

190
00:19:55,600 --> 00:20:02,240
And finally, I asked the members of the
new program.

191
00:20:02,240 --> 00:20:08,240
I think this is the only program that
can show the Ebitu-like feeling.

192
00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:16,240
I think it would be Ebitu-like if we
could show a lot of free and loose
parts.

193
00:20:17,240 --> 00:20:27,240
I want to make the Ebitu family and the
Hoshii family think it's interesting.

194
00:20:27,240 --> 00:20:34,240
And I want to make the non-fans think
it's interesting.

195
00:20:34,880 --> 00:20:36,880
I want to make it.

196
00:20:37,880 --> 00:20:42,880
This time, I want to add something to
the show.

197
00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:45,880
It's like a science ceremony.

198
00:20:46,880 --> 00:20:48,880
And it's a location.

199
00:20:48,880 --> 00:20:51,880
I want to be more active.

200
00:20:51,880 --> 00:20:58,880
In the studio, I was often told that I
was passive.

201
00:20:58,880 --> 00:21:04,448
So I want to do my best to show myself.

202
00:21:04,448 --> 00:21:06,448
That's my one goal.

203
00:21:06,448 --> 00:21:08,448
And this is a very relaxed program.

204
00:21:08,448 --> 00:21:12,448
I want to show you how relaxed I am.

205
00:21:12,448 --> 00:21:15,448
I hope you'll be surprised.

206
00:21:16,448 --> 00:21:19,448
I think you can see the more powerful
me.

207
00:21:19,448 --> 00:21:22,448
I appeared in the first episode.

208
00:21:22,448 --> 00:21:30,752
But I'm more relaxed than before.

209
00:21:30,752 --> 00:21:34,752
When we were planning for the Ebitu
Global,

210
00:21:34,752 --> 00:21:38,752
at first we couldn't talk much,

211
00:21:38,752 --> 00:21:41,752
and we were all like, wow, wow, wow,

212
00:21:41,752 --> 00:21:43,752
as we were stacking up the times.

213
00:21:43,752 --> 00:21:46,752
But this time, we're all like, wow, wow,
wow,

214
00:21:46,752 --> 00:21:50,752
and we're going to add a lot of things,

215
00:21:50,752 --> 00:21:55,752
and we're going to have fun.

216
00:21:55,752 --> 00:21:58,480
Please watch it. Thank you.

217
00:21:58,480 --> 00:22:02,480
We have a lot of friends in the group.

218
00:22:02,480 --> 00:22:09,480
So we rarely get along with the people
we've worked with.

219
00:22:09,480 --> 00:22:16,480
But we've loved Nagayoboshi-san since
before we started working together.

220
00:22:16,480 --> 00:22:20,480
So when I heard that we could work
together, I was really happy.

221
00:22:20,480 --> 00:22:23,480
And we talked to each other more and
more.

222
00:22:23,480 --> 00:22:28,480
I think it's the first time we've gotten
along so well.

223
00:22:28,592 --> 00:22:32,592
I'm so happy when I hear that we can do
a show together.

224
00:22:32,592 --> 00:22:37,592
So, I hope we can make lots of memories
together this time as well.

225
00:22:37,592 --> 00:22:41,592
And I hope we can grow further as a
group.

226
00:22:41,592 --> 00:22:45,592
I hope Nagareboshi-san will teach us a
lot.

227
00:22:46,592 --> 00:22:52,592
In the last Global Ka! Project, I always
relied on Nagareboshi-san.

228
00:22:52,592 --> 00:22:58,000
But this time, I was able to do a show
with him.

229
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:01,000
I hope I can contribute to this.

230
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:06,000
And from Kashiwagi...

231
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:12,000
The program is about adding various
things.

232
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:15,000
Adding them and experiencing various
things.

233
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:21,000
I hope I can grow up with this
experience.

234
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:23,000
And there is also a starfish.

235
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:27,424
I think it will be fun and interesting.

236
00:23:27,424 --> 00:23:31,424
I hope it will be a lively program.

237
00:23:32,424 --> 00:23:36,424
We are also the ones who are added to
the Ebitu.

238
00:23:36,424 --> 00:23:38,424
Added to the Ebitu.

239
00:23:38,424 --> 00:23:42,424
I think it would be nice if the Ebitu
explodes with a chemical change.

240
00:23:42,424 --> 00:23:49,152
Please look forward to it.

241
00:23:49,152 --> 00:23:51,152
Please look forward to it.

242
00:23:51,152 --> 00:23:53,152
Switch on!

243
00:23:55,152 --> 00:23:59,152
The first episode of Ebichu Tastas is
Ebichu Tastas Switch.

244
00:24:05,152 --> 00:24:08,152
Ebichu is pushing the switch.

245
00:24:09,152 --> 00:24:11,152
Oh, it's coming!

246
00:24:12,152 --> 00:24:14,152
It's shining!

247
00:24:14,152 --> 00:24:18,152
Ebichu Tastas, target at 11 o'clock at
night.

248
00:24:20,218 --> 00:24:26,218
This program was provided by the sponsor
you are watching.

249
00:24:36,618 --> 00:24:38,298
Greek necessarily.

250
00:24:38,298 --> 00:24:42,118
Will be launched in DEUTSCH package.
