 What?

02:40.208 --> 02:41.208
 A snake?

02:41.208 --> 02:42.208
 A lion.

02:43.208 --> 02:46.208
 I was scared of this when I was a kid.

02:46.208 --> 02:47.208
 It's scary.

02:48.208 --> 02:50.208
 I thought it was a fortune-teller.

02:50.208 --> 02:52.208
 I only know its face.

02:52.208 --> 02:54.208
 It's imitating my face.

02:57.096 --> 02:59.096
 I'm sleepy.

03:00.096 --> 03:02.096
 I'm going to die.

03:15.960 --> 03:16.960
 It's coming out.

03:17.960 --> 03:19.960
 I'm sure it's a fortune-teller.

04:10.218 --> 04:12.218

04:13.218 --> 04:15.218
 I didn't touch this side, but it's
good.

04:15.218 --> 04:17.218

puberty.

04:27.218 --> 04:29.218
 I'm scared.

04:31.218 --> 04:33.218
 I have to be careful.

04:33.218 --> 04:39.218
 You have been developing something from
puberty.

04:40.218 --> 04:46.218
 I'm a person who has a strong ability
to develop.

04:47.218 --> 04:48.218
 You are...

04:49.218 --> 04:50.218

06:27.306 --> 06:31.306

07:29.010 --> 07:31.010
 It's fluffy.

07:31.010 --> 07:35.010
 But if you get out of there, it's
pretty fast.

07:36.010 --> 07:37.010
 Like a Tentomushi.

07:37.010 --> 07:44.416

 Look at this.

10:20.474 --> 10:22.474
 It's not messed up.

10:22.474 --> 10:24.474
 It was amazing.

10:24.474 --> 10:26.474
 We were here for a while.

10:26.474 --> 10:28.474

10:28.474 --> 10:30.474
 I couldn't see anything.

10:30.474 --> 10:32.474
 I couldn't see anything.

10:32.474 --> 10:34.474
 You were alone.

11:07.584 --> 11:09.584
 But we have a ride.

11:09.584 --> 11:11.584

11:11.584 --> 11:12.584
 I don't know.

11:12.584 --> 11:13.584
 Oh, I see.

11:13.584 --> 11:15.584
 You still feel like riding?

11:16.584 --> 11:19.584

to ride.

11:19.584 --> 11:21.584
 I keep saying that.

11:21.584 --> 11:23.584
 Sorry, I'm always joking.

11:23.584 --> 11:24.584
 I'm glad you're not joking.

11:24.584 --> 11:25.584
 I don't want to joke.

 I look forward to working with you.

14:34.298 --> 14:36.298
 What are you talking about?

14:36.298 --> 14:39.298
 Let's eat!

14:41.672 --> 14:42.672
 It's good.

14:42.672 --> 14:43.672
 It's good.

14:44.672 --> 14:46.672
 The fruit is so sweet.

14:47.672 --> 14:51.672
 I'm a detective eating pancakes in the
zoo.

14:53.672 --> 14:59.672
 I eat banana and pancake and rice in
the morning.

14:59.672 --> 15:00.672
 The banana is falling.

15:01.672 --> 15:02.672
 Don't eat the banana.

15:03.672 --> 15:04.672
 I'll eat the banana later.

15:04.672 --> 15:07.672
 What about me?

15:09.808 --> 15:11.808
 It's delicious!

15:11.808 --> 15:13.808
 It's delicious!

15:13.808 --> 15:15.808
 Banana

15:23.408 --> 15:25.408
 I'm surprised.

15:25.408 --> 15:27.408
 Gorilla next to me.

15:27.408 --> 15:29.408
 Gorilla next to me.

15:29.408 --> 15:31.408
 You said banana.

15:31.408 --> 15:33.408
 It's delicious.

15:33.408 --> 15:35.408
 Pancake is still hot.

15:37.408 --> 15:39.408
 And this banana.

15:39.408 --> 15:41.408
 Banana also has a good taste.

15:43.408 --> 15:45.408
 Oh, is that so?

15:45.408 --> 15:47.408
 Because it's a banana, it's a gorilla.

15:47.408 --> 15:49.408
 I see.

15:49.408 --> 15:51.408
 Now?

15:51.408 --> 15:53.408
 I'm surprised.

15:54.128 --> 16:04.128
 We'll meet again, Spring!

16:10.128 --> 16:11.128
 1, 2, 3!

16:12.128 --> 16:13.128
 That's not it!

16:13.128 --> 16:15.128
 It's not in the song.

16:15.128 --> 16:19.128
 Today, I'm wearing a uniform!

16:20.384 --> 16:22.384
 Hitoka did it for me.

16:22.384 --> 16:23.384
 Yes, I did.

16:23.384 --> 16:24.384
 Wait a moment.

16:24.384 --> 16:25.384
 Wait a moment.

16:27.384 --> 16:28.384
 Isn't it great?

16:28.384 --> 16:30.384
 Hitoka, you did your best, didn't you?

16:30.384 --> 16:31.384
 Yes, I did.

16:33.384 --> 16:34.384
 It's great.

16:39.384 --> 16:43.384
 So, we are Hitoka and Haru.

16:43.384 --> 16:44.384
 See you!

16:44.384 --> 16:45.384
 Bye bye!

16:45.384 --> 16:48.384
 Let's do it together next time!

16:52.072 --> 16:53.072
 I did it!

16:54.072 --> 16:56.072
 Isn't it different from usual?

16:57.072 --> 16:58.072
 I got it!

16:58.072 --> 17:00.072
 I did it! I got the license!

17:04.256 --> 17:06.256
 Let's go play together.

17:08.256 --> 17:10.256
 Bye bye.

17:13.256 --> 17:17.256
 We got a new hairband.

17:17.256 --> 17:18.256
 Yay!

17:18.256 --> 17:20.256
 Thank you.

17:22.256 --> 17:25.256
 Haru, you said you got a new hairband,
so I thought your bangs got a new
hairband.

17:27.256 --> 17:29.256
 I got a new hairband today.

17:29.256 --> 17:37.256
 I met Julia on the day of the video
shoot.

17:37.256 --> 17:45.256
 So, when I asked her to show me her
teeth, she didn't show me at all.

17:45.256 --> 17:48.256
 It was before I was discharged from the
hospital, so I was still a NG.

17:48.256 --> 17:59.256
 The members were also NG.

17:59.256 --> 18:02.256
 We started the show today.

18:02.256 --> 18:06.256
 Who is here today?

18:06.256 --> 18:08.256
 Let's go.

18:09.256 --> 18:12.256
 It's Kanami from Suzy.

18:12.256 --> 18:15.256
 Yay!

18:15.256 --> 18:17.256
 I'm wearing a yukata.

18:17.256 --> 18:18.256
 Look.

18:18.256 --> 18:22.256
 It's summer.

18:23.256 --> 18:25.256
 It's a flash firework.

18:25.256 --> 18:29.256
 I want to be with you all in the flash
firework.

18:30.256 --> 18:32.256
 Bambi is here.

18:32.256 --> 18:34.256
 I'm here.

18:34.256 --> 18:41.256
 Bambi's birthday party was over, and so
was Kanami.

18:41.256 --> 18:43.256
 It's over.

18:44.256 --> 18:46.256
 It was fun.

18:46.256 --> 18:48.256
 So, hurry up and tell us about Bambi.

18:48.256 --> 18:51.256
 Tell us about Bambi.

18:51.256 --> 18:52.256
 No.

18:52.256 --> 18:53.256
 What should I do?

18:53.256 --> 18:54.256
 Please.

18:54.256 --> 18:55.256
 I'm sorry.

18:55.256 --> 18:58.256
 I'm sorry to ask you such a cute
request.

18:58.256 --> 18:59.256
 I want to hear it.

18:59.256 --> 19:03.256
 I've been asking you to do it in the
dressing room, but you said no.

19:03.256 --> 19:04.256
 Look.

19:04.256 --> 19:07.256
 It's not fair.

19:09.256 --> 19:10.256
 I'll ask you later.

19:10.256 --> 19:12.256
 No.

19:16.256 --> 19:18.256
 I ate a bear cake.

19:18.256 --> 19:19.256
 It looked delicious.

19:19.256 --> 19:21.256
 It was delicious.

19:21.256 --> 19:22.256
 It was good.

19:22.256 --> 19:24.256
 I wanted you to surprise me.

19:24.256 --> 19:29.256
 I wanted you to surprise me, so I asked
you to do it.

19:29.256 --> 19:32.256
 Look at the point of this yukata.

19:32.256 --> 19:34.256
 It's red.

19:35.256 --> 19:39.256
 Bambi likes yukatas like Japanese
clothes.

19:39.256 --> 19:40.256
 I like it.

19:40.256 --> 19:42.256
 I like festivals.

19:42.256 --> 19:43.256
 It's the season.

19:43.256 --> 19:44.256
 It's great.

19:44.256 --> 19:45.256
 It's summer.

19:45.256 --> 19:48.256
 I like the atmosphere of festivals and
summer.

19:48.256 --> 19:51.256
 I talked too much.

19:51.256 --> 20:10.650
 Bye bye.

20:10.650 --> 20:14.310
 I'm being perfunctory as always.

20:14.410 --> 20:15.890
 Next week

20:19.810 --> 20:20.930
 I-I'm still wrong?!

20:25.350 --> 20:27.690
 Unless Yuuka is wrong, can't be at
peace?!

20:27.690 --> 20:32.690
 To the future!

20:34.416 --> 20:46.016
 Their previous album is the best sales
of seasonal items!

20:46.016 --> 20:49.516
 Until the day we meet again-

21:01.616 --> 21:03.616
 It's so close.
