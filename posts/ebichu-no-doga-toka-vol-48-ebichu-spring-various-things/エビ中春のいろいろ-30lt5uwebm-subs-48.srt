1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Ebichu's video!

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,000
This is the final of the Sashana series.

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:11,000
I'm Yoko Hasegawa.

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:13,000
I cut my bangs by myself.

5
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:15,000
I cut my hair myself at night.

6
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:17,000
I'm Kaoriko.

7
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:18,000
I'm Rie.

8
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,000
Rie has already left?

9
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:24,000
Rie is in Kanagawa Prefecture, so she's
coming with a camera.

10
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000
Bye-bye!

11
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,000
Say bye-bye!

12
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Bye-bye!

13
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
This is the final of the tour.

14
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:40,000
I haven't performed since April 2nd, so
I feel like I'm in the final.

15
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
I'm wearing this today because it's my
first day.

16
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
I'm getting beautiful.

17
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:52,000
It's the last day of SIX VOCES, so I'm
looking forward to it.

18
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Anyway, I'm looking forward to it until
the end.

19
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
I'll do my best!

20
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
I'm looking forward to it until the end.

21
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:06,000
I'm glad that the fans are coming to the
tour final.

22
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:10,000
I'm looking forward to it because it's
the last day.

23
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:14,000
It's the final, but I'm nervous because
it's my first day.

24
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:18,000
I'm looking forward to it.

25
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:22,000
I think my friends will come.

26
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
Yes!

27
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
Anyway, I'm looking forward to it.

28
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:32,000
It's the last day, so I'm looking
forward to it.

29
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:36,000
I'll do my best today.

30
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
I'm going to Japan!

31
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
I'm going to Japan!

32
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:50,000
Today is the tour final.

33
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:54,000
I'm going to do my best.

34
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
I'm wearing this.

35
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
I'm going to the final!

36
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
Thank you!

37
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
Yeah!

38
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,000
Please come!

39
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
Yeah!

40
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
I'll do my best with the manager!

41
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000
I'm glad you came!

42
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:22,000
We're doing a rehearsal on May 5th.

43
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
Today is May 2nd.

44
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:28,000
I'm going to do my best!

45
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
It's over now.

46
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:40,000
It's been a long time since we've done a
rehearsal like this.

47
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:44,000
It's already the 3rd day.

48
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:50,000
It's already the group of 9 people.

49
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:54,000
It's been a long time since we've done a
rehearsal like this.

50
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:58,000
It's been a long time since we've done a
rehearsal like this.

51
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
I'm here.

52
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
I'm here.

53
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:06,000
I'm always looking at you.

54
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:12,000
We're going to be out of time for a
month.

55
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:18,000
We're going to be out of time for a
month.

56
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:22,000
It's a new set.

57
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
It's a new set.

58
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
We didn't think of it.

59
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,386
We didn't think of it.

60
00:03:28,386 --> 00:03:30,386
Ayaka's personality was very similar to
Ayaka.

61
00:03:30,386 --> 00:03:34,386
Ayaka's voice was very similar to Ayaka.

62
00:03:34,386 --> 00:03:38,386
Ayaka's voice was very similar to Ayaka.

63
00:03:38,386 --> 00:03:42,386
I want you to say Ayaka's voice someday.

64
00:03:42,386 --> 00:03:44,386
I'm looking forward to it.

65
00:03:44,386 --> 00:03:50,386
May 5th is the end of the live
broadcast.

66
00:03:50,386 --> 00:03:54,386
We don't know how we feel yet.

67
00:03:54,386 --> 00:03:57,386
We don't know how we feel yet.

68
00:03:57,386 --> 00:04:02,386
When you watch this video, you will know
that we are a 9-member group.

69
00:04:02,386 --> 00:04:07,386
We will continue to live as a 9-member
group.

70
00:04:07,386 --> 00:04:10,386
Please support us.

71
00:04:10,386 --> 00:04:13,386
I will do my best someday.

72
00:04:19,386 --> 00:04:21,386
It's a party.

73
00:04:21,386 --> 00:04:22,386
Goodbye.

74
00:04:22,386 --> 00:04:25,386
Please take care of your wrist.

75
00:04:25,386 --> 00:04:27,386
Thank you.

76
00:04:27,386 --> 00:04:30,386
I will do my best.

77
00:04:34,386 --> 00:04:36,386
I'm sorry for the kiss.

78
00:04:36,386 --> 00:04:38,386
It's my style.

79
00:04:38,386 --> 00:04:39,386
Kiss me.

80
00:04:43,386 --> 00:04:47,386
I'm scared of Niko.

81
00:04:47,386 --> 00:04:48,386
I'm scared.

82
00:04:48,386 --> 00:04:50,386
I kissed you because I didn't know.

83
00:04:50,386 --> 00:04:52,386
I'm also kissing you.

84
00:04:52,386 --> 00:04:55,386
I'm also kissing you.

85
00:04:56,386 --> 00:04:58,386
Good morning.

86
00:04:58,386 --> 00:05:00,386
We are SHINCHE BISHOP.

87
00:05:00,386 --> 00:05:02,386
Please take care of us.

88
00:05:02,386 --> 00:05:05,386
Please take care of us.

89
00:05:15,386 --> 00:05:17,386
It's outside.

90
00:05:17,386 --> 00:05:20,386
It's Nakayama time, but I'm alone.

91
00:05:20,386 --> 00:05:22,386
I'm going to do it.

92
00:05:22,386 --> 00:05:24,386
I'm going to do it a little more.

93
00:05:24,386 --> 00:05:26,386
I'm going to do it a little more.

94
00:05:27,386 --> 00:05:29,386
I'm done.

95
00:05:32,386 --> 00:05:36,386
I will change clothes.

96
00:05:39,386 --> 00:05:42,386
Please take a picture of the calm.

97
00:05:42,386 --> 00:05:45,386
Please take a picture of the calm.

98
00:05:45,386 --> 00:05:49,386
We are wide-angle on the sieve.

99
00:05:49,386 --> 00:05:51,386
Let us take a photo.

100
00:05:51,386 --> 00:05:55,386
This is an outfit that you picked.

101
00:06:02,386 --> 00:06:04,386
What about you?

102
00:06:04,386 --> 00:06:06,386
What about Maki?

103
00:06:06,386 --> 00:06:08,386
natural.

104
00:06:10,386 --> 00:06:14,386
She is cool without clothes.

105
00:06:14,386 --> 00:06:16,346
Thank you for watching.

106
00:06:16,346 --> 00:06:20,446
Has the next training psychological
impact?

107
00:06:21,526 --> 00:06:24,966
When you come here, the image of the
scenery comes out.

108
00:06:25,506 --> 00:06:28,526
So it's only your face can go on air.

109
00:06:29,626 --> 00:06:31,606
What's up

110
00:06:32,326 --> 00:06:33,426
Are you surprised?

111
00:06:33,566 --> 00:06:34,766
Smiling

112
00:06:42,046 --> 00:06:43,606
It's finished.

113
00:06:43,606 --> 00:06:49,606
After this, we'll be able to put on new
artists' photos at 9 o'clock, so let's
hurry up and change!

114
00:06:49,606 --> 00:06:51,606
It's over!

115
00:06:51,606 --> 00:06:53,606
Everyone, hurry up!

116
00:06:55,606 --> 00:06:57,606
It's over!

117
00:06:59,606 --> 00:07:01,606
It's over!

118
00:07:01,606 --> 00:07:09,606

00:07:09,606 --> 00:07:17,606
It's over!

120
00:07:17,606 --> 00:07:33,606
It's over!

121
00:07:47,606 --> 00:07:49,606
It's over!

122
00:07:49,606 --> 00:07:51,606
It's over!

123
00:07:51,606 --> 00:07:53,606
It's over!

124
00:07:53,606 --> 00:07:55,606
It's over!

125
00:07:55,606 --> 00:07:57,606
It's over!

126
00:07:57,606 --> 00:07:59,606
It's over!

127
00:07:59,606 --> 00:08:01,606
How was it?

128
00:08:01,606 --> 00:08:03,606
What did you like about the photos?

129
00:08:03,606 --> 00:08:07,606
I'm the 13th place, 4th grade, Sakura
Ikokona.

130
00:08:07,606 --> 00:08:09,606
Thank you for your support.

131
00:08:09,606 --> 00:08:11,606
What's your favorite food?

132
00:08:11,606 --> 00:08:19,606
My favorite food is raw oysters and
meat. My specialty is the ice balance.

133
00:08:19,606 --> 00:08:23,606
What was the most memorable moment?

134
00:08:23,606 --> 00:08:27,606
It was very white. The light hit me.

135
00:08:27,606 --> 00:08:35,606
I thought that I was once again a
shrimp. I was very impressed.

136
00:08:35,606 --> 00:08:39,606
What's your favorite food?

137
00:08:39,606 --> 00:08:47,606
I think it's the people who are full of
personality and are energetic and
bright.

138
00:08:48,834 --> 00:08:50,834
I get a lot of comments like,

139
00:08:50,834 --> 00:08:52,834
I'm here!

140
00:08:52,834 --> 00:08:56,834

00:08:58,834 --> 00:09:02,834
Maybe there's a fan meeting next time.

143
00:09:02,834 --> 00:09:05,834
When I become a brave audience,

144
00:09:05,834 --> 00:09:08,834
I want to be able to perform

145
00:09:08,834 --> 00:09:12,834
in a way that doesn't lower the quality.

146
00:09:12,834 --> 00:09:15,834
What is your next stage?

147
00:09:15,834 --> 00:09:19,834

I was very nervous when I first got into
the costume.

175
00:10:44,834 --> 00:10:49,834
Until then, we were dancing together
while watching the live video.

176
00:10:49,834 --> 00:10:52,834
I was very nervous from then.

177
00:10:52,834 --> 00:10:55,834
What was the most memorable moment?

178
00:10:55,834 --> 00:10:59,834
It was a moment.

00:10:59,834 --> 00:11:04,834
I couldn't answer the questions well,
but it was fun.

180
00:11:04,834 --> 00:11:07,834

I'm glad to meet you.

183
00:11:13,834 --> 00:11:16,834
I'm glad to meet you.

184
00:11:16,834 --> 00:11:18,834
I will do my best.

185
00:11:18,834 --> 00:11:22,834
I'm the second-year student of the 55th
class.

186
00:11:22,834 --> 00:11:24,834
Thank you.

187
00:11:24,834 --> 00:11:27,482
What is your favorite anime?

188
00:11:27,482 --> 00:11:30,482
My favorite food is dumplings.

189
00:11:30,482 --> 00:11:37,482
My specialty is birthday card making and
physical training.

190
00:11:37,482 --> 00:11:40,482
What was the most exciting thing about
the show?

191
00:11:40,482 --> 00:11:50,482
I was nervous until the show started,
but it was fun to finish it in one go.

192
00:11:50,482 --> 00:11:52,482
Do you have any memories?

193
00:11:52,482 --> 00:11:55,482
Yes, I do.

194
00:11:55,482 --> 00:12:03,482
I don't remember the last part, but I
remember the last part.

195
00:12:03,482 --> 00:12:07,482
What was the most exciting thing about
the show?

196
00:12:07,482 --> 00:12:11,482
I was nervous even when there was no
audience.

197
00:12:11,482 --> 00:12:21,482
I thought it would be a little dangerous
if there were fans, but I thought it
would be nice because it would make the
audience excited.

198
00:12:21,482 --> 00:12:29,482
I think I'm nervous, so I practice a lot
to be confident and dance.

199
00:12:29,482 --> 00:12:33,482
What do you like about the show?

200
00:12:33,482 --> 00:12:47,482
I think I like Ebichu a lot.

201
00:12:47,482 --> 00:12:50,482
What is your favorite part of the show?

202
00:12:50,482 --> 00:12:57,482
I'm the youngest, so I'll do my best.

203
00:12:57,482 --> 00:13:06,821
Please support me.
