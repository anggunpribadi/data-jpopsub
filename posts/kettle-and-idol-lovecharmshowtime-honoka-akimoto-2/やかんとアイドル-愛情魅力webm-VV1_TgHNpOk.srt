1
00:00:00,250 --> 00:00:04,250
I'm a nightclub and an idol!

2
00:00:05,250 --> 00:00:07,250
We have a special project for this show.

3
00:00:07,250 --> 00:00:12,250
We're going to have you say the title to
the camera.

4
00:00:12,250 --> 00:00:14,250
Is that okay?

5
00:00:14,250 --> 00:00:16,250
It says, I'm cute.

6
00:00:16,250 --> 00:00:17,250
I'm sorry.

7
00:00:17,250 --> 00:00:18,250
I'll do my best!

8
00:00:18,250 --> 00:00:26,640
I'm going to say it! My three main
elements!

9
00:00:27,640 --> 00:00:28,640
Thank you!

10
00:00:29,640 --> 00:00:32,640
Now, it's time to introduce the three
elements that make up you.

11
00:00:33,640 --> 00:00:37,640
We'd like to learn more about our guest,
Ile-san.

12
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:42,640
So, can you show us your three main
elements?

13
00:00:43,640 --> 00:00:45,640
Here are my three main elements.

14
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:48,640
First, Shonen Manga.

15
00:00:49,640 --> 00:00:51,640
Second, ice cream.

16
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:53,640
Third, sports.

17
00:00:53,640 --> 00:00:55,640
I see!

18
00:00:56,400 --> 00:00:58,400
I chose this one.

19
00:00:58,400 --> 00:01:03,400
I'm curious about everything, so I'd
like to dig one by one.

20
00:01:07,936 --> 00:01:10,336
First, Shonen Manga.

21
00:01:10,436 --> 00:01:11,436
Yes.

22
00:01:11,676 --> 00:01:15,576
I love Shonen Manga.

23
00:01:15,676 --> 00:01:16,876
I have three brothers.

24
00:01:16,976 --> 00:01:18,976
Oh, I see.

25
00:01:19,076 --> 00:01:22,876
I grew up surrounded by manga.

26
00:01:22,976 --> 00:01:25,416
So I drew Shonen Manga.

27
00:01:25,516 --> 00:01:27,516
Oh, Shonen Manga.

28
00:01:27,616 --> 00:01:29,816
I love Shonen Manga.

29
00:01:29,916 --> 00:01:32,816
I graduated from college,

30
00:01:32,916 --> 00:01:35,556
but I also wrote my graduation thesis in
Jump.

31
00:01:35,556 --> 00:01:37,956
What?

32
00:01:38,056 --> 00:01:39,956
I'm sorry. What do you mean?

33
00:01:40,056 --> 00:01:43,456
I wrote my graduation thesis in Jump.

34
00:01:43,556 --> 00:01:46,456
How did you think of Jump?

35
00:01:46,556 --> 00:01:49,956
I read the definition of a popular manga

36
00:01:50,056 --> 00:01:52,456
from Shonen Jump.

37
00:01:52,556 --> 00:01:53,456
Oh, I see.

38
00:01:53,556 --> 00:01:56,456
I wanted to know the definition of a
popular manga.

39
00:01:56,556 --> 00:02:01,956
I have a lot of favorite manga in Jump.

40
00:02:01,956 --> 00:02:05,856
But the definition of a popular manga
changes with time.

41
00:02:05,956 --> 00:02:07,356
Yes, it changes.

42
00:02:07,456 --> 00:02:10,356
Yes, it's a market theory.

43
00:02:10,456 --> 00:02:13,156
No matter how interesting a manga is,

44
00:02:13,256 --> 00:02:15,156
if the result of the survey is not good,

45
00:02:15,256 --> 00:02:18,256
the legend will change.

46
00:02:18,356 --> 00:02:22,956
So I thought, if I knew the definition
of a popular manga,

47
00:02:23,056 --> 00:02:26,556
I could never finish it.

48
00:02:26,656 --> 00:02:27,856
I see.

49
00:02:27,956 --> 00:02:30,156
I thought so.

50
00:02:30,156 --> 00:02:31,956
You did a research.

51
00:02:32,056 --> 00:02:32,956
Yes, I did.

52
00:02:33,056 --> 00:02:35,956
I actually asked the publisher for help.

53
00:02:36,056 --> 00:02:36,956
No way!

54
00:02:37,056 --> 00:02:38,456
I went to ask them.

55
00:02:38,556 --> 00:02:39,456
You did?

56
00:02:39,556 --> 00:02:43,456
The editor of One Piece and Kimetsu no
Tanto

57
00:02:43,556 --> 00:02:46,956
told me about the definition of a
popular manga.

58
00:02:47,056 --> 00:02:49,456
I said, of course, I wrote it in Jump.

59
00:02:49,556 --> 00:02:51,456
He said, it's interesting.

60
00:02:51,556 --> 00:02:53,956
I asked him,

61
00:02:54,056 --> 00:02:57,956
and he told me about the definition of a
popular manga.

62
00:02:57,956 --> 00:03:01,756
He said, in the 90s, the main character
is a bad guy.

63
00:03:01,856 --> 00:03:06,756
Or, it's better to make a manga about a
guy who is more popular than the main
character.

64
00:03:06,856 --> 00:03:08,756
Or, it's better to make a manga about
four people.

65
00:03:08,856 --> 00:03:11,756
Or, it's better to make a manga about a
martial arts.

66
00:03:11,856 --> 00:03:14,256
Or, it's better to make a manga about a
long technique.

67
00:03:14,356 --> 00:03:15,756
There were many opinions.

68
00:03:15,856 --> 00:03:16,756
I see.

69
00:03:16,856 --> 00:03:22,256
I was curious about the most popular
manga.

70
00:03:22,356 --> 00:03:27,600
The most popular manga was Yu Yu
Hakusho.

71
00:03:28,600 --> 00:03:30,600
I see, that surprised me.

72
00:03:30,600 --> 00:03:33,600
I was wondering which manga you'd come
up with.

73
00:03:33,600 --> 00:03:35,600
There are many elements.

74
00:03:35,600 --> 00:03:38,600
The elements that make it popular.

75
00:03:38,600 --> 00:03:40,600
The elements that make it popular.

76
00:03:40,600 --> 00:03:43,600
Yu Yu Hakusho has all of them.

77
00:03:43,600 --> 00:03:46,600
That's the result of my study.

78
00:03:48,600 --> 00:03:51,600
There's a lot of media mixing now,

79
00:03:51,600 --> 00:03:56,600
but the number of window openings is
increasing.

80
00:03:56,736 --> 00:03:59,236
I think the number of layers of the
viewer is increasing.

81
00:03:59,236 --> 00:04:00,236
I see.

82
00:04:00,236 --> 00:04:02,236
So you're also working on that?

83
00:04:02,236 --> 00:04:03,236
Yes.

84
00:04:03,236 --> 00:04:05,236
You're laughing.

85
00:04:08,236 --> 00:04:11,236
Do you have any other recommended works?

86
00:04:11,236 --> 00:04:12,236
Right now?

87
00:04:12,236 --> 00:04:13,736
Yes, Shonen Manga.

88
00:04:13,736 --> 00:04:15,236
What should I do?

89
00:04:15,236 --> 00:04:18,236
I'll start with Jump.

90
00:04:18,236 --> 00:04:20,236
Jump's Akane Banashi.

91
00:04:20,236 --> 00:04:21,236
Akane Banashi?

92
00:04:21,236 --> 00:04:21,736
Yes.

93
00:04:21,736 --> 00:04:25,736
I've been reading it for about three
volumes.

94
00:04:25,736 --> 00:04:27,236
You've read it for three volumes?

95
00:04:27,236 --> 00:04:28,236
Yes.

96
00:04:28,236 --> 00:04:30,736
It's a story about Rakugo.

97
00:04:30,736 --> 00:04:32,736
It's a new kind of Kirito.

98
00:04:32,736 --> 00:04:34,236
That's amazing.

99
00:04:34,236 --> 00:04:41,236
The girl's father was a Rakugo artist,
but he got fired.

100
00:04:41,236 --> 00:04:42,736
The girl thinks,

101
00:04:42,736 --> 00:04:46,236
why did my father get fired?

102
00:04:46,236 --> 00:04:48,736
She's like a reverse teacher.

103
00:04:48,736 --> 00:04:49,736
And she says,

104
00:04:49,736 --> 00:04:53,736
I'll take the top spot in Rakugo.

105
00:04:53,736 --> 00:04:55,736
That's really interesting.

106
00:04:55,736 --> 00:04:56,736
I want to read it.

107
00:04:56,736 --> 00:04:57,736
I know, right?

108
00:04:57,736 --> 00:04:58,736
I want to read it now.

109
00:04:58,736 --> 00:05:00,736
One Piece's Oda-sensei is also praising
it.

110
00:05:00,736 --> 00:05:01,736
He's praising it?

111
00:05:01,736 --> 00:05:02,736
Yes.

112
00:05:02,736 --> 00:05:04,736
That Oda-sensei is also good.

113
00:05:04,736 --> 00:05:06,736
He's a 10-year-old.

114
00:05:06,736 --> 00:05:08,736
He's good at recommending.

115
00:05:08,736 --> 00:05:10,736
He's reading Hiroshi.

116
00:05:10,736 --> 00:05:12,736
It's interesting.

117
00:05:15,736 --> 00:05:18,736
Ice cream is sold out really fast.

118
00:05:18,736 --> 00:05:20,736
Every week.

119
00:05:20,736 --> 00:05:24,736
Every week, a new convenience store ice
cream is released.

120
00:05:29,626 --> 00:05:32,626
This program is brought to you by...

121
00:05:32,626 --> 00:05:35,626
Tosakamin-san

122
00:05:35,626 --> 00:05:38,626
Sadaaki-san

123
00:05:38,626 --> 00:05:41,626
Hidepio-san

124
00:05:41,626 --> 00:05:44,626
Kurobake-san

125
00:05:44,626 --> 00:05:47,626
Kagichi-san

126
00:05:47,626 --> 00:05:51,626
I'm sending you these manga!

127
00:05:51,626 --> 00:05:54,626
Today's recommended manga is...

128
00:05:54,626 --> 00:05:57,626
Danga-dan
