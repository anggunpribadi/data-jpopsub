An exciting school trip in Gero! 97th Episode
Delivered from Gero City, Gifu Prefecture, with the cooperation of Yukai Resort Gero Saichoraku! Start with a mysterious face panel lol

This time, the two of them (Honoka Akimoto & Nao Sakura) came to "Gero Onsen Gassho Village" where you can see the gassho style of Shirakawa-go. When you actually enter the gassho-zukuri, The life of the private house where they lived at that time is reproduced, and they are also very curious!

There is a sweet shop called Bankoan at the end of the tunnel, so they took a short break here. There is a sunken hearth at the edge of the Masuda-zukuri old private house. A nice atmosphere with wooden floors, tatami mats, folding doors, etc.

The Banko Anmitsu they're looking for is colorful and bright! This looks great! Red cherry tomatoes pickled in honey, warabi mochi with sashimi konnyaku, There are many things that are not found in ordinary anmitsu, such as shiratama dumplings made with tofu, tomatoes, and mugwort! In fact, everything is made with local specialties!

Next, the two headed for the forest slide. The starting point is quite high, so the two of them were a little tired by the time we climbed up... When they try to slide, you will get a lot of speed, and both of you will scream! Excited!

It was a lot of history, gourmet, activities, etc. Look forward to great photos!
