Today's day duty: Kaho Kobayashi

Program content: This time, we will go on a winter excursion, abbreviated as "Fuen" special, after the annual summer outdoor event "Famien". Ebichu members boarded a sightseeing bus under the guidance of a tour guide Nagareboshi and visited "Mother Farm" in Chiba Prefecture. The first program prepared by the tour guide Nagareboshi is the popular "Little Pig Race" at Mother Farm. The members form a pair and aim for the goal by manipulating the little pigs! The members have a hard time against the piggy that runs freely. Kaho Kobayashi, who doesn't like animals, tries to escape...and the race becomes more heated than expected. Who the hell will win!? ? In addition, we will also deliver the pattern of the first one-man live performance of Sakura Ebi ~ which was held last month! Also the latest information. looking forward to! !
