00:02:27,858 --> 00:02:29,858
I don't want to hear that

00:02:36,858 --> 00:02:42,858

It's Oga-ta Kaiki

43
00:02:54,858 --> 00:02:58,858
Why is Oga-ta not here today?

44
00:02:58,858 --> 00:03:06,858
Oga-ta Kaiki and I are going to
collaborate on the new album that will
be released today

45
00:03:06,858 --> 00:03:16,858
Last December, Oga-ta-san made a song

46
00:03:16,912 --> 00:03:17,912
What?

47
00:03:17,912 --> 00:03:22,912
Oga-ta-Kaiki produced a song for the
next album

48
00:03:23,912 --> 00:03:26,912
Is this really not a prank?

49
00:03:26,912 --> 00:03:27,912
No, no, no

50
00:03:27,912 --> 00:03:28,912

51
00:03:28,912 --> 00:03:29,912
Already sang?

52
00:03:29,912 --> 00:03:30,912

00:03:30,912 --> 00:03:31,912

We can't do this

58
00:03:46,128 --> 00:03:48,128
Let's call the great teacher

00:04:21,690 --> 00:04:23,690

70
00:04:23,690 --> 00:04:25,690
He's not introducing himself.

71
00:04:25,690 --> 00:04:27,690
Please come again.

72
00:04:27,690 --> 00:04:29,690
Thank you.

73
00:04:29,690 --> 00:04:31,690
Mr.Kai.

74
00:04:31,690 --> 00:04:33,690
What was the song like?

75
00:04:33,690 --> 00:04:35,690
Was it perfect?

76
00:04:35,690 --> 00:04:37,690
It was perfect.

77
00:04:37,690 --> 00:04:43,690
I heard from the members that you
recorded the song.

78
00:04:43,690 --> 00:04:45,690
What kind of song was it?

79
00:04:45,690 --> 00:04:49,690
It was a great explosion of talent.

80
00:04:49,690 --> 00:04:51,690
It was a great explosion.

81
00:04:51,690 --> 00:05:01,690
We only know the teacher who is involved
in the variety show.

82
00:05:01,690 --> 00:05:03,690
By the way, you are in a band, right?

83
00:05:03,690 --> 00:05:05,690
Yes, I'm in a band.

84
00:05:05,690 --> 00:05:07,690
Of course.

85
00:05:07,690 --> 00:05:13,690
In the program, he is treated like a
comedian.

86
00:05:13,690 --> 00:05:17,690
He collaborated with Ebichu as an
artist.

87
00:05:17,690 --> 00:05:21,690
He is a musician.

88
00:05:21,690 --> 00:05:23,690
What kind of band was it?

89
00:05:23,690 --> 00:05:25,690
We are in a band called Here.

90
00:05:25,690 --> 00:05:27,690
Do you know the band called Here?

91
00:05:27,690 --> 00:05:29,690
Yes, we know.

92
00:05:29,690 --> 00:05:31,690
Great.

93
00:05:31,690 --> 00:05:33,690
What do you know?

94
00:05:33,690 --> 00:05:35,690
I watched a lot of music videos.

95
00:05:35,690 --> 00:05:37,690
I watched the music video of eating
sand.

96
00:05:37,690 --> 00:05:39,690
Eating sand music video.

97
00:05:39,690 --> 00:05:41,690
Eating sand.

98
00:05:41,690 --> 00:05:43,690
You are a comedian.

99
00:05:43,690 --> 00:05:45,690
No, I'm not.

100
00:05:45,690 --> 00:05:47,690
What do other people think of you?

101
00:05:47,690 --> 00:05:49,690
I'm a burning person.

102
00:05:49,690 --> 00:05:51,690
I'm a burning person.

103
00:05:51,690 --> 00:05:53,690
I'm a burning person.

104
00:05:53,690 --> 00:05:55,690
You are a burning person.

105
00:05:55,690 --> 00:05:57,690
I watch you a lot.

106
00:05:57,690 --> 00:05:59,690
I'm a fan.

107
00:05:59,690 --> 00:06:01,690
I watch you a lot.

108
00:06:01,690 --> 00:06:03,690
Have you ever watched the music video of
Matsuno?

109
00:06:03,690 --> 00:06:05,690
I haven't.

110
00:06:05,690 --> 00:06:07,690
I haven't.

111
00:06:07,690 --> 00:06:09,690
I haven't.

112
00:06:09,690 --> 00:06:11,690
We are the same.

113
00:06:11,690 --> 00:06:13,690
We are the same.

114
00:06:13,690 --> 00:06:15,690
Wait, you guys are calling me.

115
00:06:15,690 --> 00:06:17,690
Great teacher.

116
00:06:17,690 --> 00:06:23,690
Let's watch the music video of Here.

117
00:06:23,690 --> 00:06:25,690
There is a music video.

118
00:06:25,690 --> 00:06:27,690
Great.

119
00:06:27,690 --> 00:06:33,104
What kind of band is Here?

120
00:06:33,104 --> 00:06:36,104
Please watch the live video.

121
00:06:36,104 --> 00:07:00,104
I love CINICLRAVE.

122
00:07:00,544 --> 00:07:04,544
After this, surprise day here comes.

123
00:07:05,544 --> 00:07:06,544
It's so cool.

124
00:07:07,544 --> 00:07:08,544
When is this live?

125
00:07:09,544 --> 00:07:10,544
Let's go.

126
00:07:10,544 --> 00:07:27,544
Are you excited?

127
00:07:28,064 --> 00:07:30,064
Please make a bigger voice!

128
00:07:32,064 --> 00:07:35,064
Let me introduce the members of HIA!

129
00:07:36,064 --> 00:07:39,064
First, guitarist, Mitsuashi Hayato!

130
00:07:50,064 --> 00:07:52,064
And the other one, guitarist, Takeda
Masayuki!

131
00:07:52,064 --> 00:07:54,064
And the other one, guitarist, Takeda
Masayuki!

132
00:07:54,064 --> 00:07:58,938
Thank you!

133
00:07:58,938 --> 00:08:00,938
The next one is...

134
00:08:00,938 --> 00:08:02,938
I'm sorry!

135
00:08:02,938 --> 00:08:03,938
And...

136
00:08:03,938 --> 00:08:05,938
Daisuke Miyano!

137
00:08:05,938 --> 00:08:22,938
The next one is...

138
00:08:22,938 --> 00:08:26,816
I'm sorry!

139
00:08:26,816 --> 00:08:29,816
We were able to meet the members

140
00:08:29,816 --> 00:08:30,816
What did you think?

141
00:08:30,816 --> 00:08:33,816
After watching the live show, you were
excited

142
00:08:33,816 --> 00:08:35,816
It was cool

143
00:08:37,816 --> 00:08:42,816
This is the line from the beginning of
recording

144
00:08:43,816 --> 00:08:44,816
He's biting it

145
00:08:44,816 --> 00:08:47,816
He's biting it

146
00:08:47,816 --> 00:08:48,816
It's interesting

147
00:08:48,816 --> 00:08:52,816
Okada-san, do you understand that it's a
proper locker?

148
00:08:52,816 --> 00:08:53,816
Yes

149
00:08:53,816 --> 00:08:59,816
So, you were treating Ogata-san as a
very important person

150
00:08:59,816 --> 00:09:00,816
That's true

151
00:09:00,816 --> 00:09:03,816
He's not a very good character

152
00:09:03,816 --> 00:09:07,816
Today, let's apologize to Ogata-san

153
00:09:07,816 --> 00:09:08,816
Yes

154
00:09:09,816 --> 00:09:13,816
We found out that Ogata Kaiki was a
famous musician

155
00:09:14,816 --> 00:09:18,816
So we will apologize to the person who
has misunderstood this opportunity

156
00:09:18,816 --> 00:09:22,816
Let's apologize to Ogata-san who made
the new song of Ebichu

157
00:09:25,562 --> 00:09:31,562
Okada-san, you've been apologizing to
Okada-san for this

158
00:09:31,562 --> 00:09:33,562
He'll reflect on his mistake and
apologize

159
00:09:33,562 --> 00:09:34,562
Yes

160
00:09:34,562 --> 00:09:39,562
There's a card that you can't forgive

161
00:09:39,562 --> 00:09:40,562
Please show us

162
00:09:40,562 --> 00:09:42,562
It's in lock mode

163
00:09:42,562 --> 00:09:44,562
Can I be strict?

164
00:09:44,562 --> 00:09:46,562
You can

165
00:09:46,562 --> 00:09:47,562
That's right

166
00:09:47,562 --> 00:09:48,562
I can't help it

167
00:09:48,562 --> 00:09:49,562
Yasumoto

168
00:09:49,562 --> 00:09:50,562
Yes

169
00:09:50,562 --> 00:09:52,562
Actually

170
00:09:52,562 --> 00:09:53,562
Yes

171
00:09:53,562 --> 00:09:58,562
I accidentally called Okada-chan or
Kaiki-chan

172
00:09:58,562 --> 00:10:02,562
I thought it was rude

173
00:10:02,562 --> 00:10:04,562
I'm a person of the same age

174
00:10:04,562 --> 00:10:06,562
I didn't notice

175
00:10:06,562 --> 00:10:10,608
Let's apologize to Yasumoto

176
00:10:10,608 --> 00:10:12,608
I'm sorry, Ogata-chan

177
00:10:14,608 --> 00:10:16,608
She's out of her mind

178
00:10:16,608 --> 00:10:18,608
She's out of her mind

179
00:10:19,608 --> 00:10:23,608
Even though she's older, she's still
trying to get rid of Yasumoto

180
00:10:23,608 --> 00:10:25,608
Will she forgive her?

181
00:10:25,608 --> 00:10:33,520
Where is the criminal?

182
00:10:33,520 --> 00:10:35,520
It was close

183
00:10:37,520 --> 00:10:39,520
I forgive you

184
00:10:39,520 --> 00:10:41,520
I want you to call me that from now on

185
00:10:41,520 --> 00:10:45,280
I picked it up

186
00:10:45,280 --> 00:10:52,780
Well, I think that Mr. Ogata is becoming
a comedian

187
00:10:52,780 --> 00:10:57,780
I think he is becoming a comedian now

188
00:10:57,780 --> 00:10:58,780
I'm sorry

189
00:11:00,780 --> 00:11:02,280
I heard that you are a comedian

190
00:11:02,780 --> 00:11:04,780
I'm a comedian

191
00:11:04,780 --> 00:11:08,280
At first, I said rock star

192
00:11:08,280 --> 00:11:10,780
I'm a comedian who makes that into a
joke

193
00:11:11,780 --> 00:11:12,780
I see

194
00:11:12,780 --> 00:11:15,780
I thought you were adding roses

195
00:11:15,780 --> 00:11:20,780
I thought you were a comedian who made
that into a joke

196
00:11:21,780 --> 00:11:26,780
Hirota is thinking of giving up singing
and going on a path of a comedian

197
00:11:26,780 --> 00:11:29,472
I won't forgive you

198
00:11:29,472 --> 00:11:33,472
I have a part that I can't forgive, so
I'll forgive you

199
00:11:34,472 --> 00:11:35,472
That was good

200
00:11:35,472 --> 00:11:37,472
She's totally forgiving

201
00:11:37,472 --> 00:11:39,472
Next, Kashiwagi

202
00:11:39,472 --> 00:11:44,472
When we first met, I didn't think you
were a rock musician. I'm sorry

203
00:11:44,472 --> 00:11:46,472
I see

204
00:11:46,472 --> 00:11:48,472
When we first met...

205
00:11:48,472 --> 00:11:50,472
When we first met, we were...

206
00:11:50,472 --> 00:11:52,472
Shrimp rock

207
00:11:56,472 --> 00:11:58,472
She was wearing a dress

208
00:11:58,472 --> 00:12:01,472
But then, you were already in the shrimp
rock and shrimp Amigo

209
00:12:01,472 --> 00:12:03,472
But you were already in the camera

210
00:12:03,472 --> 00:12:05,472
That's how it was

211
00:12:05,472 --> 00:12:07,472
I won't forgive you, shrimp Amigo

212
00:12:07,472 --> 00:12:09,472
Shrimp Amigo

213
00:12:09,472 --> 00:12:11,472
We're rivals

214
00:12:11,472 --> 00:12:13,472
What did you think Kashiwagi was?

215
00:12:13,472 --> 00:12:17,472
A strange, arrogant new comedian is
working hard

216
00:12:17,472 --> 00:12:19,472
In the end, you become a comedian

217
00:12:20,472 --> 00:12:25,472
Kashiwagi, who thought that only
arrogant reactions were for the new
comedian

218
00:12:25,472 --> 00:12:28,472
Will you forgive me? I won't forgive you

219
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:36,600
When I was about to announce this song,
Kashiwagi-san was the happiest, so I'll
forgive you

220
00:12:39,376 --> 00:12:40,876
I forgive you a lot

221
00:12:40,876 --> 00:12:41,876
Let's move on

222
00:12:41,876 --> 00:12:43,876
There are so many

223
00:12:43,876 --> 00:12:44,876
There are so many?

224
00:12:44,876 --> 00:12:45,876
Yes, there are

225
00:12:45,876 --> 00:12:46,876
Nakayama, let's go

226
00:12:47,876 --> 00:12:51,876
I thought Ogata-san was the first guest

227
00:12:51,876 --> 00:12:52,876
I'm sorry

228
00:12:53,876 --> 00:12:54,876
I see, you're a single-minded person

229
00:12:54,876 --> 00:12:55,876
Yes, yes

230
00:12:55,876 --> 00:12:59,876
So when Ogata-san came again for the
second time

231
00:12:59,876 --> 00:13:03,876
I thought he was this person again, I'm
sorry

232
00:13:03,876 --> 00:12:44,336
You were

233
00:13:06,876 --> 00:13:08,876
There are two, there are two

234
00:13:08,876 --> 00:13:12,876
Even though he was the first guest, he
came again and again

235
00:13:12,876 --> 00:13:14,876
Nakayama thought that, will he forgive
him?

236
00:13:14,876 --> 00:13:16,876
Won't he forgive him?

237
00:13:16,876 --> 00:13:19,876
I've been able to wear two

238
00:13:19,876 --> 00:13:21,876
Will he forgive you?

239
00:13:21,876 --> 00:13:22,876
It's a good thing

240
00:13:22,876 --> 00:13:24,876
Will he come at the end?

241
00:13:24,876 --> 00:13:26,876
I didn't think so either

242
00:13:26,876 --> 00:13:28,876
I'll forgive you

243
00:13:28,876 --> 00:13:30,876
I didn't think so either, I'll forgive
you

244
00:13:30,876 --> 00:13:31,876
You did?

245
00:13:31,876 --> 00:13:33,876
I've been able to wear a lot, I'll
forgive you

246
00:13:33,876 --> 00:13:38,876
By the way, Ogata-san forgave all the
other members' complaints

247
00:13:38,876 --> 00:13:43,840
Ogata-san is a musician with a deep
heart

248
00:13:43,840 --> 00:13:46,980
We are prepared to see

249
00:13:50,540 --> 00:13:53,540
So this means you have enough of variety

250
00:13:57,940 --> 00:14:00,280
I will choose a lot of celebrities

251
00:14:00,280 --> 00:14:01,600
Of course

252
00:14:03,400 --> 00:14:04,360
Come on carried

253
00:14:05,280 --> 00:14:06,720
I told you

254
00:14:07,720 --> 00:14:10,660
Ok then, Ogata who now has the image of
a comedian

255
00:14:10,660 --> 00:14:13,940
Let's have fun with a variety of
battles!

256
00:14:13,940 --> 00:14:15,460
So...

257
00:14:15,460 --> 00:14:18,500
Ebichu vs. Hiya, the third match of the
flame!

258
00:14:18,500 --> 00:14:24,634
First, the three-wheeled car relay
match!

259
00:14:24,634 --> 00:14:28,914
There are 8 people in the middle of the
game, so there are only 4 people here.

260
00:14:28,914 --> 00:14:30,914
Everyone here will play 2 rounds.

261
00:14:30,914 --> 00:14:31,414
I see.

262
00:14:31,414 --> 00:14:34,414
Isn't the number of coins different?

263
00:14:34,414 --> 00:14:34,914
What?

264
00:14:34,914 --> 00:14:36,414
The number of coins.

265
00:14:36,414 --> 00:14:37,414
Is that so?

266
00:14:37,414 --> 00:14:38,414
Isn't that the same?

267
00:14:38,414 --> 00:14:42,914
This is a competition between adults and
children.

268
00:14:42,914 --> 00:14:44,914
It's a little bit different.

269
00:14:44,914 --> 00:14:45,914
It's a little bit different.

270
00:14:45,914 --> 00:14:47,914
It's really different.

271
00:14:47,914 --> 00:14:49,914
I'll start.

272
00:14:49,914 --> 00:14:51,914
Then, it's a three-wheel drive.

273
00:14:51,914 --> 00:14:53,914
Start!

274
00:14:53,914 --> 00:14:55,914
Good luck!

275
00:14:59,002 --> 00:15:00,002
Mayama!

276
00:15:00,002 --> 00:15:02,002
What is Mayama doing?

277
00:15:02,002 --> 00:15:03,002
Let's go!

278
00:15:03,002 --> 00:15:06,002
Mayama looks good on the service car

279
00:15:06,002 --> 00:15:07,002
Mayama!

280
00:15:07,002 --> 00:15:09,002
I'm fast too

281
00:15:09,002 --> 00:15:10,002
I'm fast too

282
00:15:10,002 --> 00:15:12,002
Maiki-chan is fast

283
00:15:12,002 --> 00:15:13,002
Mayama is fast

284
00:15:13,002 --> 00:15:14,002
Good luck!

285
00:15:14,002 --> 00:15:15,002
Good luck!

286
00:15:16,002 --> 00:15:17,002
It's a button touch

287
00:15:17,002 --> 00:15:18,002
Let's go!

288
00:15:18,002 --> 00:15:19,808
Mayama is fast too

289
00:15:19,808 --> 00:15:21,808
unexpectedly

290
00:15:21,808 --> 00:15:25,808
Take-chan

291
00:15:25,808 --> 00:15:27,808
Take-chan is good

292
00:15:29,808 --> 00:15:33,808
Take-chan chance

293
00:15:33,808 --> 00:15:37,808
Skirt

294
00:15:37,808 --> 00:15:39,808
Skirt is bigger than I thought

295
00:15:39,808 --> 00:15:41,808
Take-chan

296
00:15:41,808 --> 00:15:43,808
Everyone has a skirt

297
00:15:43,808 --> 00:15:45,808
Go

298
00:15:45,808 --> 00:15:49,808
Wait

Kiss

306
00:16:09,808 --> 00:16:11,808

Take-chan is fast

315
00:16:27,808 --> 00:16:29,808
Mitsui is fast

316
00:16:29,808 --> 00:16:31,808
No

317
00:16:31,808 --> 00:16:33,808
No

318
00:16:33,808 --> 00:16:35,808
Take-chan is good

319
00:16:35,808 --> 00:16:37,808
Take-chan is fast

320
00:16:37,808 --> 00:16:39,808
Take-chan is fast

321
00:16:39,808 --> 00:16:41,808

322
00:16:41,808 --> 00:16:43,808
5 people

323
00:16:45,808 --> 00:16:47,808
Hey

324
00:16:47,808 --> 00:16:49,808
Do we have to do this?

325
00:16:49,808 --> 00:16:51,808
Yes

326
00:16:51,808 --> 00:16:53,808
Go

327
00:16:53,808 --> 00:16:55,808

328
00:16:55,808 --> 00:16:57,808
Go

329
00:16:57,808 --> 00:16:59,808
It's dangerous

330
00:16:59,808 --> 00:17:01,808
We have to turn around

331
00:17:01,808 --> 00:17:03,808
It's fun

332
00:17:03,808 --> 00:17:05,808
It's fun

333
00:17:05,808 --> 00:17:07,808
It's fun

334
00:17:07,808 --> 00:17:09,808
It's like a ghost

335
00:17:09,808 --> 00:17:11,808
Here we go

336
00:17:11,808 --> 00:17:13,808

Take-chan

348
00:17:35,808 --> 00:17:37,808
Are you going to turn around?

349
00:17:37,808 --> 00:17:39,808
Yes

350
00:17:39,808 --> 00:17:41,808

354
00:17:47,808 --> 00:17:49,808

Take-chan

356
00:17:51,808 --> 00:17:53,808
How are you?

357
00:17:53,808 --> 00:17:55,808
I'm good

358
00:17:55,808 --> 00:17:57,808
Thank you

359
00:17:57,808 --> 00:17:59,808
Bye

360
00:17:59,808 --> 00:18:01,808
Take-chan

361
00:18:01,808 --> 00:18:03,808
Take-chan

362
00:18:03,808 --> 00:18:05,808
Take-chan

363
00:18:06,624 --> 00:18:10,624
Nakayama City is here

364
00:18:10,624 --> 00:18:22,522
If you come back with this, you win the
game of Ebichu

365
00:18:22,522 --> 00:18:24,522
Ebichu wins!

366
00:18:28,522 --> 00:18:30,522
This is a close call

367
00:18:30,522 --> 00:18:32,522
I lost by a huge gap

368
00:18:32,522 --> 00:18:34,522
Aren't you embarrassed?

369
00:18:34,522 --> 00:18:36,522
The rules are too different

370
00:18:36,522 --> 00:18:40,522
This is a race between three-wheeled
cars

371
00:18:40,522 --> 00:18:42,522
What happened?

372
00:18:42,522 --> 00:18:52,522
Ebichu wins!

373
00:18:53,120 --> 00:18:56,120
This is a standard version of variety
show.

374
00:18:57,120 --> 00:19:01,120
The winner is the one who gets the
answer faster.

375
00:19:01,120 --> 00:19:04,120
Ebichu, who will go first?

376
00:19:04,120 --> 00:19:06,120
Kashiwagi?

377
00:19:06,120 --> 00:19:07,120
Hiya?

378
00:19:07,120 --> 00:19:09,120
I'm the leader!

379
00:19:09,120 --> 00:19:10,120
Alright!

380
00:19:14,120 --> 00:19:16,120
In the box of Kashiwagi...

381
00:19:16,120 --> 00:19:18,120
Here it is.

382
00:19:18,120 --> 00:19:20,120
Konnyaku.

383
00:19:20,120 --> 00:19:23,120
The big box is...

384
00:19:24,120 --> 00:19:26,120
Zari Gani.

385
00:19:28,120 --> 00:19:32,120
The excitement of the contents is
different, but it's just a handicap.

386
00:19:32,120 --> 00:19:36,528
The winner is the one who gets the
answer faster.

387
00:19:36,528 --> 00:19:38,528
Let's start.

388
00:19:38,528 --> 00:19:40,528
What's inside the box?

389
00:19:40,528 --> 00:19:42,528
Start!

390
00:19:42,528 --> 00:19:44,528
Please put your hands in.

391
00:19:44,528 --> 00:19:46,528
Where?

392
00:19:46,528 --> 00:19:48,528
It's a good feeling.

393
00:19:48,528 --> 00:19:50,528
It's a good feeling.

394
00:19:50,528 --> 00:19:52,528
What's wrong?

395
00:19:52,528 --> 00:19:54,528
Please touch it.

396
00:19:58,528 --> 00:20:00,528
More.

397
00:20:00,528 --> 00:20:02,528
Wait.

398
00:20:02,528 --> 00:20:04,528
More.

399
00:20:04,528 --> 00:20:06,528
More.

400
00:20:06,528 --> 00:20:08,528
Please stop.

401
00:20:08,528 --> 00:20:10,528
What's inside the box?

402
00:20:10,528 --> 00:20:12,528
Konjac.

403
00:20:12,528 --> 00:20:14,528
Correct.

404
00:20:14,528 --> 00:20:16,528
Let's have Ms.Kaichi touch it.

405
00:20:16,528 --> 00:20:18,528
Wait.

406
00:20:18,528 --> 00:20:20,528
More.

407
00:20:20,528 --> 00:20:22,528
More.

408
00:20:26,528 --> 00:20:30,528
After the second round, the two of them
are in the lead.

409
00:20:30,528 --> 00:20:34,528
The last one will be the special rule.

410
00:20:34,528 --> 00:20:36,528
The final round.

411
00:20:36,528 --> 00:20:44,048
If you win, you get 100,000 points.

412
00:20:44,048 --> 00:20:46,048
It has nothing to do with the previous
game.

413
00:20:46,048 --> 00:20:49,048
That's the promise of variety show.

414
00:20:49,048 --> 00:20:51,048
Please do your best.

415
00:20:51,048 --> 00:20:53,048
Next is the same standard of variety
show.

416
00:20:53,048 --> 00:20:56,048
The battle of the fast-eating curry.

417
00:20:57,048 --> 00:20:58,048
Thank you.

418
00:20:59,048 --> 00:21:01,048
After this, the final battle.

419
00:21:01,048 --> 00:21:02,048
The menu of the big.

420
00:21:02,048 --> 00:21:04,048
The drink.

421
00:21:04,048 --> 00:21:11,712
And the title of the collaboration song.

422
00:21:11,712 --> 00:21:15,472
The power battle of fast food curry!

423
00:21:15,472 --> 00:21:17,472
Thank you!

424
00:21:17,568 --> 00:21:19,568
It looks delicious

425
00:21:19,568 --> 00:21:21,568
It looks delicious

426
00:21:21,568 --> 00:21:23,568
Where is it?

427
00:21:23,568 --> 00:21:25,568
It looks delicious

428
00:21:25,568 --> 00:21:27,568
It looks very delicious

429
00:21:27,568 --> 00:21:29,568
There are a few

430
00:21:29,568 --> 00:21:32,568
Adults and children, so there are a few

431
00:21:32,568 --> 00:21:35,568
Is it a little? Isn't it three times
different?

432
00:21:35,568 --> 00:21:37,568
The one who will challenge is

433
00:21:37,568 --> 00:21:39,568
Hoshina who is not good at spicy food

434
00:21:39,568 --> 00:21:41,568
Musician Ogata

435
00:21:41,568 --> 00:21:42,568
I will go

436
00:21:42,568 --> 00:21:44,568
Spicy curry challenge

437
00:21:44,568 --> 00:21:46,568
Start

438
00:21:46,568 --> 00:21:48,568
Go for it

439
00:21:55,098 --> 00:21:57,098
It's spicy

440
00:21:57,098 --> 00:21:59,098
It's spicy

441
00:21:59,098 --> 00:22:01,098
How spicy is it?

442
00:22:01,098 --> 00:22:03,098
It's the spiciest in my life

443
00:22:03,098 --> 00:22:05,098
It looks spicy

444
00:22:05,098 --> 00:22:07,098
How spicy is it?

445
00:22:07,098 --> 00:22:09,098
It's spicy

446
00:22:09,098 --> 00:22:11,098
It's the spiciest in my life

447
00:22:11,098 --> 00:22:13,098
It's so smelly

448
00:22:13,098 --> 00:22:15,098
Are you okay?

449
00:22:15,098 --> 00:22:17,098
It's a game

450
00:22:17,098 --> 00:22:19,098
I have to win

451
00:22:19,098 --> 00:22:21,098
You can do it

452
00:22:21,098 --> 00:22:23,098
It's like drinking

453
00:22:23,098 --> 00:22:25,098
It's so spicy

454
00:22:25,098 --> 00:22:27,098
Let's stop eating rice

455
00:22:27,098 --> 00:22:29,098
It's getting slow

456
00:22:29,098 --> 00:22:31,098
I don't know yet

457
00:22:31,098 --> 00:22:33,098
I don't know yet

458
00:22:33,098 --> 00:22:35,098
I can do it

459
00:22:35,098 --> 00:22:37,098
I can do it

460
00:22:37,098 --> 00:22:39,098
I can do it

461
00:22:39,098 --> 00:22:41,098
I won the last game

462
00:22:41,098 --> 00:22:43,098
I won the last game

463
00:22:43,098 --> 00:22:45,098
I won the last game

464
00:22:45,098 --> 00:22:47,098
Thank you

465
00:22:47,098 --> 00:22:49,098
I'll get a kiss

466
00:22:49,098 --> 00:22:51,098
I'll get a kiss

467
00:22:51,098 --> 00:22:53,098
You sweat a lot

468
00:22:53,098 --> 00:22:55,098
So

469
00:22:55,098 --> 00:22:57,098
In variety show

470
00:22:57,098 --> 00:22:59,098
Ebi-chu is the straight win

471
00:22:59,098 --> 00:23:01,098
The third game is over

472
00:23:01,098 --> 00:23:03,098
But one question

473
00:23:03,098 --> 00:23:05,098
But one question

474
00:23:05,098 --> 00:23:07,098
It was exciting

475
00:23:07,098 --> 00:23:09,098
What was it?

476
00:23:09,098 --> 00:23:11,098
What was it?

477
00:23:11,098 --> 00:23:13,098
I don't know

478
00:23:13,098 --> 00:23:15,098
The new song

479
00:23:15,098 --> 00:23:17,098
That's right

480
00:23:17,098 --> 00:23:19,098
The song that you made

481
00:23:19,098 --> 00:23:21,098
That's right

482
00:23:29,098 --> 00:23:31,098
Please tell us a song title

483
00:23:33,098 --> 00:23:35,098
It's called

484
00:23:35,098 --> 00:23:37,598
It's called

485
00:23:42,598 --> 00:23:44,698
It's called

486
00:23:45,098 --> 00:23:47,098
Hendik

487
00:23:47,098 --> 00:23:54,318
I made the feeling of moving towards the
new year with a strong heart

488
00:23:54,318 --> 00:23:56,318
It smells like curry

489
00:23:56,318 --> 00:23:58,318
It smells spicy

490
00:23:58,318 --> 00:24:01,318
Everyone in Ebichu recorded it, right?

491
00:24:01,318 --> 00:24:02,318
Yes

492
00:24:02,318 --> 00:24:04,318
How was it?

493
00:24:04,318 --> 00:24:11,318
The sound was so cool that it was
recorded

494
00:24:11,318 --> 00:24:14,318
The tension of the recording was very
high

495
00:24:14,318 --> 00:24:21,318
Kaiki did all the recording

496
00:24:21,318 --> 00:24:23,318
She did the direction

497
00:24:23,318 --> 00:24:26,318
This part is more like this

498
00:24:26,318 --> 00:24:30,318
It was different from Kaiki of TASTAS

499
00:24:30,318 --> 00:24:31,318
Really?

500
00:24:31,318 --> 00:24:33,318
How was it different?

501
00:24:33,318 --> 00:24:35,318
The clothes were not like this

502
00:24:35,318 --> 00:24:37,318
The face was not like this

503
00:24:37,318 --> 00:24:41,318
I'm curious about it, but let's close
the diary

504
00:24:41,318 --> 00:24:46,318
Next time, Kaiki Ogata will announce the
new song of Ebichu

505
00:24:46,318 --> 00:24:49,318
Moratorium Junior High School

506
00:24:49,318 --> 00:24:51,318
Please look forward to it

507
00:24:51,318 --> 00:24:53,318
There is no microphone

508
00:24:53,318 --> 00:24:55,318
Air microphone

509
00:24:55,318 --> 00:24:57,318
Next time, finally

510
00:24:57,318 --> 00:25:04,318
The whole of the collaboration song that
Kaiki Ogata of Ebichu has realized is
clear

511
00:25:04,318 --> 00:25:12,318
The close-up document of the musicians
Ogata and the members who wanted to
record

512
00:25:12,318 --> 00:25:14,318
It's a batch

513
00:25:14,318 --> 00:25:16,318
It's the best

514
00:25:16,318 --> 00:25:22,318
Before the album release, the new full
version will be released soon

515
00:25:22,318 --> 00:25:27,040
I think it will be a exciting song

516
00:25:27,040 --> 00:25:33,040
This program was provided by the sponsor
you are watching

517
00:25:40,058 --> 00:25:45,058
Thank you for watching!
