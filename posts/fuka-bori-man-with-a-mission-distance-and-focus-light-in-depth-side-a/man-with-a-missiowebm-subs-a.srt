1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,200
As you can see, we have a strong desire
for rock bands.

2
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:09,200
We have mountains and valleys,

3
00:00:09,200 --> 00:00:12,800
and the fact that we can experience rock
bands in the valleys

4
00:00:12,800 --> 00:00:27,962
can help you to pursue your roles.

5
00:00:27,962 --> 00:00:29,962
Welcome to Fukaboru!

6
00:00:29,962 --> 00:00:31,962
Thank you.

7
00:00:31,962 --> 00:00:33,962
I'm looking forward to it.

8
00:00:33,962 --> 00:00:35,962
It's been a while.

9
00:00:35,962 --> 00:00:37,962
Thank you.

10
00:00:37,962 --> 00:00:39,962
It's a beautiful set.

11
00:00:39,962 --> 00:00:41,962
It's going to be a hit.

12
00:00:41,962 --> 00:00:43,962
Me too.

13
00:00:43,962 --> 00:00:45,962
It's cool.

14
00:00:45,962 --> 00:00:47,962
Thank you for preparing such a beautiful
costume.

15
00:00:47,962 --> 00:00:49,962
Thank you.

16
00:00:49,962 --> 00:00:52,486
Thank you.

17
00:00:52,486 --> 00:00:54,486
Thank you.

18
00:01:52,486 --> 00:01:54,486
Thank you.

19
00:01:58,202 --> 00:02:06,202
I think the first time we saw Man with a
Mission was in 2010.

20
00:02:06,202 --> 00:02:08,592
As minutes go by, things like these
start to form.

21
00:02:08,592 --> 00:02:15,592
We're a visual band, and the eye-catch
has become a hot topic.

22
00:02:15,592 --> 00:02:24,592
We've been making various ballads and
aggressive rock songs for the music.

23
00:02:24,592 --> 00:02:33,592
After about two years, we thought about
what it would be like to be the main
vocalist.

24
00:02:33,592 --> 00:02:40,592
When I saw my band, and when I made this
song called Distance, I was like...

25
00:02:40,704 --> 00:02:42,704
It came naturally to me.

26
00:02:42,704 --> 00:02:49,704
I think the sound of The Man With A
Mission is one of the songs that can be
said in a few words.

27
00:02:49,704 --> 00:02:54,704
I think this is the most important
reason why I thought it was an axis.

28
00:02:54,704 --> 00:02:57,936
We, all the band members, are...

29
00:02:57,936 --> 00:02:59,936
We're all different genres of music.

30
00:02:59,936 --> 00:03:01,936
Really?

31
00:03:01,936 --> 00:03:03,936
Yes, we're all different.

32
00:03:03,936 --> 00:03:07,936
I'm a 90's alternative guitar rocker,

33
00:03:07,936 --> 00:03:09,936
and Kamikaze is a bass player.

34
00:03:09,936 --> 00:03:14,160
We're both from the same generation, but
we're both melo-core and punk.

35
00:03:14,160 --> 00:03:19,160
We both like club music and vocal music.

36
00:03:19,160 --> 00:03:25,160
We're both different, but I think we're
both from the same generation.

37
00:03:25,160 --> 00:03:30,160
We're both rockers from the 90s. We're
all in the same hybrid.

38
00:03:30,160 --> 00:03:34,160
We're all working on a new genre.

39
00:03:34,160 --> 00:03:38,160
We're all influenced by that generation.

40
00:03:38,160 --> 00:03:41,712
So, what do we do if we're in this
generation?

41
00:03:41,712 --> 00:03:49,512
We've been working on this song for a
long time, and this song has a lot of
elements.

42
00:03:49,512 --> 00:03:58,672
There's the aggressive guitar sound, the
rap, the melody, the essence of the
track music,

43
00:03:58,672 --> 00:04:01,112
a mixture of all that, the

44
00:04:01,112 --> 00:04:05,592
They're supposed to be connected in
these aspects.

45
00:04:05,616 --> 00:04:07,876
It all just happened, then.

46
00:04:07,936 --> 00:04:09,956
As soon as they ended it was like,

47
00:04:09,956 --> 00:04:12,896
this really started if we were really
satisfied.

48
00:04:13,056 --> 00:04:16,016
This is an 있at we all recognize,

49
00:04:16,016 --> 00:04:17,496
we had this song,

50
00:04:17,496 --> 00:04:20,556
that was Fire Glow and Radioflag

51
00:04:20,556 --> 00:04:22,464
Ah well50

52
00:04:22,464 --> 00:04:31,464
It's one of the songs that we've been
working on.

53
00:04:31,464 --> 00:04:33,464
That's right.

54
00:04:33,464 --> 00:04:43,464
There are songs that are more danceable
and melodious, but they are also very
sound-oriented.

55
00:04:43,464 --> 00:04:55,464
The band plays various kinds of music,
and I personally think that the songs
that we can play with confidence are the
only ones that we can play.

56
00:04:55,464 --> 00:05:03,072
Among them, this song is a song that
makes me think, this is Manwiz.

57
00:05:03,072 --> 00:05:07,072
And we are like this, so we have eye-
catch.

58
00:05:07,072 --> 00:05:11,072
We thought, ーAh, we are going to play
music that gives such a cool world view.
ー

59
00:05:11,072 --> 00:05:13,072
ーThis band is like that. ー

60
00:05:13,072 --> 00:05:16,072
I think it became one of the first
songs.

61
00:05:16,072 --> 00:05:23,258
ーYes. I think the reaction was very big.

62
00:05:23,258 --> 00:05:27,258
When you choose a genre, everyone gets
the same feeling.

63
00:05:27,258 --> 00:05:31,258
It's hard to put out an original song
there.

64
00:05:31,258 --> 00:05:35,258
In our case, we are reliant on the
composer.

65
00:05:35,258 --> 00:05:42,096
We usually make the songs laid back by
Kabemikaze.

66
00:05:42,096 --> 00:05:47,496
The original idea was left to the
composer to make it look like a hybrid.

67
00:05:47,496 --> 00:05:52,616
The most important thing is the love for
the field you grew up in.

68
00:05:52,616 --> 00:06:00,056
We put out a lot of love, and as a
result, our songs became a hybrid.

69
00:06:00,056 --> 00:06:07,776
It's similar, but I think there's a lot
of admiration for rock bands.

70
00:06:07,776 --> 00:06:07,920
Thank you for watching!

71
00:06:07,920 --> 00:06:15,120
I think there's a lot of admiration for
rock musicians and rock music.

72
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:19,632
I really like everything that famous
musicians and extreme musicians do.

73
00:06:19,632 --> 00:06:22,872
I think that's what we're most proud of.

74
00:06:22,872 --> 00:06:27,992
I think it's one of the reasons why
we're still in this scene,

75
00:06:27,992 --> 00:06:33,672
because we can tell that we really like
this band.

76
00:06:33,672 --> 00:06:38,232
Do you have any memories of the process
of making this band?

77
00:06:38,232 --> 00:06:43,732
At first, the composer brings us rough
demos like this.

78
00:06:43,732 --> 00:06:48,816
It's when Kamikaze brought the demo
back.

79
00:06:48,816 --> 00:06:51,576
It was a bit of a tribal percussion.

80
00:06:51,576 --> 00:06:53,856
When I heard it, I was really impressed.

81
00:06:53,856 --> 00:06:56,856
It had a lot of DJ sounds as the main
theme.

82
00:06:56,856 --> 00:06:59,696
And it had a danceable beat to it.

83
00:06:59,696 --> 00:07:04,136
When I heard it, it was like a real
Yumi's.

84
00:07:04,136 --> 00:07:06,056
They told me to think of a riff.

85
00:07:06,056 --> 00:07:10,856
I added the first intro riff quite
instantly.

86
00:07:10,856 --> 00:07:13,536
The lyrics are also English lyrics.

87
00:07:13,536 --> 00:07:17,776
The story is written by the composer.

88
00:07:17,776 --> 00:07:21,776
I'm usually told to leave the rest to
you.

89
00:07:21,776 --> 00:07:25,216
The first time I heard it, it was as if
I had a hint.

90
00:07:25,216 --> 00:07:28,736
It was a song that I was very eager to
write.

91
00:07:28,736 --> 00:07:30,456
Everything in there was very very fast.

92
00:07:30,672 --> 00:07:32,672
You were very excited at that time.

93
00:07:32,672 --> 00:07:37,672
I don't think that it's something that
can be created by spending time.

94
00:07:37,672 --> 00:07:41,672
I think density is the most important
thing.

95
00:07:41,672 --> 00:07:45,672
If you have concentration and feelings,

96
00:07:45,672 --> 00:07:48,672
it doesn't take much time.

97
00:07:48,672 --> 00:07:52,672
I think the most important thing is
density.

98
00:07:52,672 --> 00:07:56,672
The relationship with the band members
is dense.

99
00:07:56,672 --> 00:07:58,672
Are you close?

100
00:07:58,672 --> 00:08:00,672
I think we are close.

101
00:08:00,672 --> 00:08:03,696
It's a good plus alpha.

102
00:08:03,696 --> 00:08:07,696
It's a bit vertical.

103
00:08:07,696 --> 00:08:12,696
If it's a bit vertical, it's smooth.

104
00:08:12,696 --> 00:08:18,696
In short, we both have roles.

105
00:08:18,696 --> 00:08:20,696
I'm in this field.

106
00:08:20,696 --> 00:08:25,696
I'm in the music and writing field.

107
00:08:25,696 --> 00:08:30,696
Tokyo and Naka are in the movement and
presentation field.

108
00:08:30,696 --> 00:08:32,160
We both have roles.

109
00:08:32,160 --> 00:08:35,160
If you think so, you should do it.

110
00:08:35,160 --> 00:08:40,920
We have five people who share roles.

111
00:08:40,920 --> 00:08:43,000
You have a very reliable relationship.

112
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,160
I think so.

113
00:08:44,160 --> 00:08:48,720
They talk about what they want to do.

114
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:53,480
But when they proceed, they don't have a
meeting.

115
00:08:53,480 --> 00:08:57,080
I think it's a good idea for this wolf
to do what he wants to do.

116
00:08:57,080 --> 00:09:00,384
Basically, it's a wolf who takes the
lead.

117
00:09:00,384 --> 00:09:03,864
They're Tip of the

118
00:09:11,642 --> 00:09:18,642
We, who were lost in the focus light,
are chasing after them again

119
00:09:18,642 --> 00:09:24,642
We fall down thousands of times and even
tens of thousands of times and try to
stand up

120
00:09:24,642 --> 00:09:30,642
Ignoring the ridiculous noise and the
annoying noise

121
00:09:30,642 --> 00:09:37,642
We fly with the wind as we are

122
00:09:37,642 --> 00:09:41,642
Ignoring the fact that it's not just a
dream

123
00:09:42,074 --> 00:10:08,976
Hot

124
00:10:08,976 --> 00:10:14,516
As a singer or lyricist,

125
00:10:14,516 --> 00:10:20,516
I thought about where to put the message
of this band.

126
00:10:20,516 --> 00:10:27,016
For example, if you make it a love song,

127
00:10:27,016 --> 00:10:29,816
and it's a love song that will capture
people's hearts,

128
00:10:29,816 --> 00:10:34,216
it may be a world-class song, or it may
be a little offensive,

129
00:10:34,216 --> 00:10:36,916
but I want to send a strong political
message.

130
00:10:36,916 --> 00:10:37,776
Thank you for your viewing.

131
00:10:37,776 --> 00:10:40,776
There are many artists who are the basis
of this song.

132
00:10:40,776 --> 00:10:43,776
When I thought about where to put this
band,

133
00:10:43,776 --> 00:10:48,776
and where to put the strongest message
of the words,

134
00:10:48,776 --> 00:10:59,776
I thought this song was the best message
for us or for myself.

135
00:10:59,776 --> 00:11:05,520
The lyrics are smooth and fast.

136
00:11:05,520 --> 00:11:06,520
How was it?

137
00:11:06,520 --> 00:11:15,520
I think it was the melody, the chord
progression, or the rhythm pattern that
came first.

138
00:11:15,520 --> 00:11:21,520
But the melody and the melody of the
song were born almost at the same time.

139
00:11:21,520 --> 00:11:22,520
Really?

140
00:11:22,520 --> 00:11:25,520
It was so natural that it was not an
exaggeration to say that it was a direct
line of sight.

141
00:11:25,520 --> 00:11:27,520
That's amazing. Is that so?

142
00:11:27,520 --> 00:11:34,080
I decided to make the lyrics in Japanese
from the beginning, but I wanted to make
it into a story that I could say in the
message.

143
00:11:34,080 --> 00:11:38,080
When I thought about what a song is
about,

144
00:11:38,080 --> 00:11:44,080
I thought that rock music and the
admiration for rock bands are very
strong.

145
00:11:44,080 --> 00:11:54,080
I think that the most honest way to
express the passion and love for rock
music is the strongest point.

146
00:11:54,080 --> 00:12:00,080
The world of the song itself is about
trying to do something in this world.

147
00:12:00,080 --> 00:12:01,968
心差し半ばで。

148
00:12:01,968 --> 00:12:06,408
散っていった、もしくは折れてしまった人たちに対する 参加でもあり、

149
00:12:06,408 --> 00:12:11,248
今もなお前に進もうとしている人たちに対しての メッセージソングだったり。

150
00:12:11,248 --> 00:12:14,408
自分たち自身に言い聞かせているところもあったりもして、

151
00:12:14,408 --> 00:12:21,808
そこのテーマが自分が歌っててものすごく強くなり得るし、 色濃くも欠けて、

152
00:12:21,808 --> 00:12:25,968
あとは嘘を偽りのない気持ちをかけるのはやっぱりそこなのかなと思いまして。

153
00:12:25,968 --> 00:12:33,968
In a sense, it's a feeling that people
around the world have probably
experienced in common, such as love and
political messages.

154
00:12:33,968 --> 00:12:35,968
That kind of frustration and hope.

155
00:12:35,968 --> 00:12:41,968
But if you can draw it in a colorful
way, I think this is a strong point.

156
00:12:41,968 --> 00:12:48,968
When I actually wrote the song, I really
came up with the words honestly, so I
want to sing that I wonder if this is
it.

157
00:12:48,968 --> 00:12:53,968
Maybe you've been keeping what you've
been thinking in your heart all this
time.

158
00:12:53,968 --> 00:12:55,968
I think so.

159
00:12:55,968 --> 00:13:07,632
I think people who are in the band, such
as Shonari and Dai, have probably
experienced various scenes, both in and
out.

160
00:13:07,632 --> 00:13:14,632
I'm not good at songs that are bright
from the bottom of my heart.

161
00:13:14,632 --> 00:13:17,632
I always want to live.

162
00:13:17,632 --> 00:13:20,632
There are mountains and valleys.

163
00:13:20,632 --> 00:13:30,632
I think that I have more experiences in
my life than in the valley.

164
00:13:31,344 --> 00:13:36,344
I think it's a bit of a risk to make a
song from the spotlight,

165
00:13:36,344 --> 00:13:40,344
but I want to focus on that.

166
00:13:40,344 --> 00:13:46,344
I think that's why I've made more songs
like that.

167
00:13:46,344 --> 00:13:51,344
Do you always take care of the double-
sidedness when you write lyrics?

168
00:13:51,344 --> 00:13:52,368
Yes.

169
00:13:52,368 --> 00:13:54,868
I think that's the most important thing.

170
00:13:54,868 --> 00:13:58,368
Of course, I think my own feelings are
important,

171
00:13:58,368 --> 00:14:01,168
but depending on the listener, I can
hide the infinite possibilities.

172
00:14:01,168 --> 00:14:05,168
I can take both, but the rest is up to
you.

173
00:14:05,168 --> 00:14:10,368
I like the lyrics more, so I have a
sense of freedom

174
00:14:10,368 --> 00:14:15,368
and a sense of world of poetry that I
can listen to.

175
00:14:15,368 --> 00:14:18,368
It's abstract, but it's a strong
message.

176
00:14:18,368 --> 00:14:22,368
That's the one thing I care about.

177
00:14:26,618 --> 00:14:31,618
Do you write lyrics in English or
Japanese?

178
00:14:31,618 --> 00:14:34,618
Or do you just write the songs?

179
00:14:34,618 --> 00:14:36,618
I don't really care.

180
00:14:36,618 --> 00:14:41,618
When I choose a language, I choose it by
the sound.

181
00:14:41,618 --> 00:14:44,618
English is a little surprising.

182
00:14:44,618 --> 00:14:50,618
It's been around for almost 100 years,
and it's been in the middle of rock.

183
00:14:50,618 --> 00:14:52,618
It's really popular.

184
00:14:52,618 --> 00:14:54,618
It's a language that fits the sound.

185
00:14:54,624 --> 00:15:01,624
So when we write aggressive songs, we
tend to choose English.

186
00:15:01,624 --> 00:15:06,624
But when we want to give a message to
the main character,

187
00:15:06,624 --> 00:15:10,624
especially Japanese audiences, we are
based in Japan,

188
00:15:10,624 --> 00:15:16,624
and when we write songs like that, we
use Japanese freely.

189
00:15:16,624 --> 00:15:22,752
What was the reaction of the fans after
the release of Focus Light?

190
00:15:22,752 --> 00:15:29,752
This song is a single with a B side to
it.

191
00:15:29,752 --> 00:15:35,752
It's a song that I want to perform live,

192
00:15:35,752 --> 00:15:39,752
and it's a song that makes me want to be
number one or number two.

193
00:15:39,752 --> 00:15:42,960
I was very happy about that.

194
00:15:42,960 --> 00:15:51,960
We thought that was the axis of the
sound mix for the rock band.

195
00:15:51,960 --> 00:16:02,960
But the fans accepted the message of the
song and loved it as a live song.

196
00:16:02,960 --> 00:16:10,752
I was very happy that the fans
understood the message of the song.

197
00:16:10,752 --> 00:16:13,252
I became confident in myself.

198
00:16:13,252 --> 00:16:21,252
I thought that it would be natural for
us to get a sense of empathy by writing
this theme.

199
00:16:21,252 --> 00:16:25,752
I felt that the kindness of the wolfs
was also transmitted.

200
00:16:25,752 --> 00:16:34,252
We say it with our own mouth, but we
understand the truth that we want to see
the inside of the band.

201
00:16:34,252 --> 00:16:37,872
In that case, Japanese poetry is
probably very...

202
00:16:37,872 --> 00:16:41,552
It's a song that gives you the
imagination to write a song.

203
00:16:41,672 --> 00:16:45,072
I think that's why people love it.

204
00:16:45,192 --> 00:16:49,352
What does this song, Focus Light,

205
00:16:49,472 --> 00:16:53,232
mean to you, Mr. Mao?

206
00:16:53,232 --> 00:17:00,384
I've been writing poetry for the past 12
years.

207
00:17:00,384 --> 00:17:04,064
I don't think there are many moments
when you can get a sense of confidence.

208
00:17:04,064 --> 00:17:14,864
But it's not just as a writer, but it's
also the band that's been presenting the
most axis.

209
00:17:14,864 --> 00:17:23,984
I don't know when it's going to end, but
I think this theme will be the most
resonant theme in my world,

210
00:17:23,984 --> 00:17:29,808
and in your world as well.

211
00:17:29,808 --> 00:17:34,808
I want to write a good story and I want
to experience a better story myself.

212
00:17:34,808 --> 00:17:37,808
That's what I want to make a good song.

213
00:17:39,808 --> 00:17:43,808
I think we're mistaken that 1.5 billion
people in the world can make a band with
that.

214
00:17:43,808 --> 00:17:46,808
They focus on music more than we do.

215
00:17:46,808 --> 00:18:00,808
I thought about it while I was writing
it myself, but I wonder if it's a crime.
