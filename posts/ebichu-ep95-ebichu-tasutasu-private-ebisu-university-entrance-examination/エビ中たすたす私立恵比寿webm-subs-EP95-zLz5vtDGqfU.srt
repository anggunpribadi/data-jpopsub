00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
1% of flutter and 99% of heart-pounding

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,000
Congratulations!

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:16,000
This week's Ebichu Tastas will have a
full rotation test

4
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
And then

5
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,000
A face came out from the back of my head

6
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:25,000
Where did she learn this mysterious
knowledge?

7
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:29,088
And also

8
00:00:29,088 --> 00:00:31,088
You can escape from the prison

9
00:00:31,088 --> 00:00:36,088
Ebichu's amazing skills are being shown
one by one

10
00:00:36,088 --> 00:00:37,088
It's folding

11
00:00:37,088 --> 00:00:38,088
It's beautiful

12
00:00:38,088 --> 00:00:41,088
There are many strange things

13
00:00:41,088 --> 00:00:45,088
Ebichu Tastasu Start

14
00:00:58,394 --> 00:01:04,394
I'm crazy about you, I'm a heart-throb

15
00:01:05,394 --> 00:01:10,394

private Ebisu Junior High School!

17
00:01:14,394 --> 00:01:21,402
Ebisu Justice!

18
00:01:21,402 --> 00:01:26,402
This program is brought to you by these
sponsors.

19
00:01:36,194 --> 00:01:38,194
To be continued

20
00:01:38,194 --> 00:01:40,194
The Shiritsu Ebisu University entrance
exam

21
00:01:40,194 --> 00:01:42,194
Challenge Ebichu member

22
00:01:43,024 --> 00:01:47,024
The 4-character idiom quiz

23
00:01:47,024 --> 00:01:51,024
Hanabana Fuuka

24
00:01:51,024 --> 00:01:54,024
Singer song writer

25
00:01:54,024 --> 00:01:56,024
Lack of study

26
00:01:56,024 --> 00:01:58,024
And

27
00:01:58,024 --> 00:02:04,024
Dance with your belly button

28
00:02:04,024 --> 00:02:08,024
The entrance exam is 10 questions each

29
00:02:08,024 --> 00:02:12,024
The line is 80 points or more

30
00:02:12,024 --> 00:02:16,024
Half of the answers are 0 points

31
00:02:16,024 --> 00:02:20,024
The 3rd question is a foreign language

32
00:02:20,024 --> 00:02:22,024
Start

33
00:02:22,024 --> 00:02:25,658
English

34
00:02:25,658 --> 00:02:28,238
Kaioku reveals the grand plot

35
00:02:28,238 --> 00:02:32,578
Miss Nini's Masao's оз

36
00:02:33,178 --> 00:02:35,778
Do it go wrong this time

37
00:02:35,778 --> 00:02:39,778
This is the confident Ebichu member.

38
00:02:40,968 --> 00:02:43,968
The answer is Benkei's crying.

39
00:02:43,968 --> 00:02:46,968
Will everyone get the right answer?

40
00:02:46,968 --> 00:02:48,968
Let's start with Kobayashi.

41
00:02:48,968 --> 00:02:50,968
It's Kodaki-jiji's crying.

42
00:02:50,968 --> 00:02:51,968
I see.

43
00:02:51,968 --> 00:02:52,968
Kodaki-jiji.

44
00:02:52,968 --> 00:02:54,968
What does this mean?

45
00:02:54,968 --> 00:02:56,968
It makes you cry, right?

46
00:02:56,968 --> 00:02:59,968
But he doesn't do it.

47
00:02:59,968 --> 00:03:04,968
He's crying but...

48
00:03:04,968 --> 00:03:06,968
Kobayashi, I'm going to cancel your
payment.

49
00:03:06,968 --> 00:03:08,968
No!

50
00:03:08,968 --> 00:03:11,968
And Nakayama-san, please.

51
00:03:11,968 --> 00:03:13,968
It's Yowane's crying.

52
00:03:13,968 --> 00:03:15,968
What does it mean?

53
00:03:15,968 --> 00:03:17,968
It's the atmosphere of the word.

54
00:03:17,968 --> 00:03:19,968
It's the atmosphere of the word.

55
00:03:19,968 --> 00:03:22,968
Yowane and crying are the same word.

56
00:03:22,968 --> 00:03:26,968
Let's see the other members.

57
00:03:28,968 --> 00:03:30,968
Benkei's crying.

58
00:03:30,968 --> 00:03:32,968
The answer is correct.

59
00:03:32,968 --> 00:03:34,208
Thank you.

60
00:03:35,208 --> 00:03:39,208
Why did you high-five her?

61
00:03:39,208 --> 00:03:42,208
I thought she was going to study.

62
00:03:42,208 --> 00:03:43,208
I see.

63
00:03:43,208 --> 00:03:45,208
Didn't you learn it?

64
00:03:45,208 --> 00:03:48,208
I think she did.

65
00:03:49,208 --> 00:03:51,208
The fourth question is also in Japanese.

66
00:03:51,208 --> 00:03:55,408
She will be challenged to write a short
essay.

67
00:03:56,408 --> 00:03:57,408
Here is the question.

68
00:03:57,408 --> 00:04:01,408
Think of a sentence using the word,
「とどのつまり」

69
00:04:01,408 --> 00:04:10,408
「とどのつまり」 is a word that is often used
when it comes to a conclusion or a point
where you reach a conclusion.

70
00:04:10,408 --> 00:04:15,408
How does Ebichu respond to this
difficult question?

71
00:04:15,408 --> 00:04:17,408
Let's start with Hirota.

72
00:04:17,408 --> 00:04:20,408
The meaning of 「とどのつまり」 in me has been
released.

73
00:04:20,408 --> 00:04:22,408
What do you mean by that?

74
00:04:22,408 --> 00:04:24,408
What does that mean?

75
00:04:24,408 --> 00:04:26,408
It's like a time.

76
00:04:26,408 --> 00:04:28,408
Like a time?

77
00:04:28,408 --> 00:04:30,408
Like a time when you are stuck.

78
00:04:30,408 --> 00:04:32,408
Like a time when you are stuck.

79
00:04:32,408 --> 00:04:34,408
Yes, a time when you are stuck.

80
00:04:34,408 --> 00:04:36,408
So it's like you are released.

81
00:04:36,408 --> 00:04:38,408
Next, Kashiwagi.

82
00:04:40,408 --> 00:04:44,408
My mom's 「とどのつまり」 is not working at all.

83
00:04:44,408 --> 00:04:47,408
「とどのつまり」 is stuck.

84
00:04:47,408 --> 00:04:49,408
Next, Kobayashi.

85
00:04:49,408 --> 00:04:53,408
The meaning of 「とどのつまり」 is stuck in the
way to the venue.

86
00:04:53,408 --> 00:04:55,408
「とどのつまり」 is stuck.

87
00:04:55,408 --> 00:04:58,408
「とどのつまり」 is really stuck.

88
00:04:58,408 --> 00:05:01,408
It's a word that is often used.

89
00:05:01,408 --> 00:05:10,016
Many Ebichu members interpret it as a
word that describes something being
stuck.

90
00:05:11,016 --> 00:05:13,016
Mayama-san, please answer

91
00:05:13,016 --> 00:05:18,016
In short, we have to answer the
questions that the teacher has made

92
00:05:18,016 --> 00:05:21,016
That's correct. Congratulations

93
00:05:21,016 --> 00:05:24,016
I feel like I'm going to throw up

94
00:05:24,016 --> 00:05:26,016
Good luck

95
00:05:26,016 --> 00:05:30,016
Here, the oldest Mayama will show off
her knowledge

96
00:05:31,016 --> 00:05:34,016
The other members will not give up on
the same answer until the end

97
00:05:34,016 --> 00:05:37,888
Challenge the remaining questions

98
00:05:37,888 --> 00:05:40,388
Next is science questions

99
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:45,880
The insect butterfly that flutters in
the sky

100
00:05:45,880 --> 00:05:51,880
Answer the question by changing the
growth process in 4 steps

101
00:05:51,880 --> 00:05:53,880
Let's see

102
00:05:53,880 --> 00:05:55,880
Let's do it together

103
00:05:55,880 --> 00:05:56,880
Please open it

104
00:05:57,880 --> 00:06:00,880
It looks like this

105
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:02,880
Gross

106
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:05,880
Is that the first one?

107
00:06:05,880 --> 00:06:07,880
Is it the egg?

108
00:06:07,880 --> 00:06:09,880
From the egg

109
00:06:09,880 --> 00:06:12,880
It's the egg

110
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:14,880
And Hirota, too

111
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:18,880
The larva, the larva, the egg, and the
larva

112
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:20,880
The shape is the same

113
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:22,880
The egg, the larva, the larva, and the
larva

114
00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:24,880
They are in the right order

115
00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:26,880
Hirota and Hoshina are correct

116
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:28,880
But inside

117
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:33,792
There is a member who drew a butterfly
that has evolved in the world

118
00:06:34,792 --> 00:06:36,792
Yasumoto, is that a peanut?

119
00:06:36,792 --> 00:06:38,792
It's a larva

120
00:06:38,792 --> 00:06:41,792
From a larva, a face comes out

121
00:06:43,792 --> 00:06:45,792
The shell of the larva comes off

122
00:06:45,792 --> 00:06:48,792
and the wings that were closed open

123
00:06:49,792 --> 00:06:51,792
And Mayama's is...

124
00:06:51,792 --> 00:06:53,792
What was the first one? A pizza?

125
00:06:54,792 --> 00:06:58,792
From a larva, it comes out of the soil

126
00:06:58,792 --> 00:07:00,792
and it can make a face

127
00:07:00,792 --> 00:07:03,792
It's very similar

128
00:07:03,792 --> 00:07:06,792
This character is the same

129
00:07:06,792 --> 00:07:09,792
Kashiwagi, is that a symbol?

130
00:07:09,792 --> 00:07:11,792
What was the first one?

131
00:07:11,792 --> 00:07:14,792
It's a leaf with an egg

132
00:07:15,792 --> 00:07:17,792
The egg grows

133
00:07:17,792 --> 00:07:19,792
The egg grows?

134
00:07:21,792 --> 00:07:24,792
And it opens a little

135
00:07:24,792 --> 00:07:26,792
and it becomes a butterfly

136
00:07:26,792 --> 00:07:30,792
So, 3 and 4 are 3 and 4

137
00:07:31,792 --> 00:07:33,792
And Nakayama-san, what is that?

138
00:07:33,792 --> 00:07:35,792
You drew a tree

139
00:07:35,792 --> 00:07:37,792
You drew a tree as the main character

140
00:07:37,792 --> 00:07:39,792
You drew a tree as the main character

141
00:07:39,792 --> 00:07:41,792
A larva

142
00:07:41,792 --> 00:07:43,792
It's far away

143
00:07:43,792 --> 00:07:50,960
Kobayashi, who drew the tree well, is
also incorrect

144
00:07:51,960 --> 00:07:55,960
After that, he cleared the questions
well and as you can see, he got a lot of
points

145
00:07:56,960 --> 00:08:01,960
Can Nakayama, who still has 0 points,
get his revenge?

146
00:08:01,960 --> 00:08:07,960
The 9th question

147
00:08:08,992 --> 00:08:12,512
Marco Polo is a man who is similar to
the Token

148
00:08:12,512 --> 00:08:16,312
He introduced Japan as a country of the
Japanese

149
00:08:16,312 --> 00:08:16,812
I see

150
00:08:16,812 --> 00:08:20,192
Answer the question that is related to
the Japanese

151
00:08:20,192 --> 00:08:20,912
What is it?

152
00:08:20,912 --> 00:08:23,312
Is Marco Polo a person with a big head?

153
00:08:23,312 --> 00:08:24,312
Marco Polo...

154
00:08:24,312 --> 00:08:27,312
It depends on the time of the year

155
00:08:27,312 --> 00:08:29,312
It's a person with a golden hair

156
00:08:29,312 --> 00:08:30,812
It depends on the season

157
00:08:30,812 --> 00:08:32,112
A person with a golden hair?

158
00:08:32,112 --> 00:08:34,312
A person who remembers foreign words by
their hair

159
00:08:35,312 --> 00:08:38,312
I don't remember, but Marco Polo...

160
00:08:38,312 --> 00:08:40,312
The answer is...

161
00:08:40,312 --> 00:08:43,312
The golden country, Jipang

162
00:08:43,312 --> 00:08:46,312
It's a phrase that we've heard once,
but...

163
00:08:46,312 --> 00:08:48,312
During the debut...

164
00:08:48,312 --> 00:08:50,312
First, let's go with Nakayama-san

165
00:08:50,312 --> 00:08:51,312
Yes

166
00:08:51,312 --> 00:08:52,312
Is it the right answer?

167
00:08:52,312 --> 00:08:54,312
I wonder

168
00:08:55,312 --> 00:08:57,312
The country of kindness, Jipang

169
00:08:57,312 --> 00:09:00,312
That's the good thing about Japan

170
00:09:00,312 --> 00:09:02,312
The good thing about Japan?

171
00:09:02,312 --> 00:09:04,312
Kobayashi-shi, what is it?

172
00:09:04,312 --> 00:09:06,312
The mysterious country, Jipang

173
00:09:06,312 --> 00:09:08,312
It's the mysterious country, right?

174
00:09:08,312 --> 00:09:10,312
I think so too

175
00:09:10,312 --> 00:09:12,312
Kashiwagi

176
00:09:12,312 --> 00:09:14,312
The country of gratitude

177
00:09:14,312 --> 00:09:16,312
That's right

178
00:09:16,312 --> 00:09:18,312
Thank you

179
00:09:18,312 --> 00:09:20,312
Thank you, Kashiwagi

180
00:09:20,312 --> 00:09:23,312
When they realized that Japan is a good
country...

181
00:09:23,312 --> 00:09:27,648
Mayama and Hoshina have a wonderful
world

182
00:09:28,148 --> 00:09:31,148
And the final question for Ebi
University News

183
00:09:31,148 --> 00:09:34,148
Hoshina News

184
00:09:34,400 --> 00:09:38,400
We often hear about the brain water,
which is one of the Japanese regulations

185
00:09:38,400 --> 00:09:42,400
Please answer without omitting the word
brain water

186
00:09:42,400 --> 00:09:44,400
This is omitted right?

187
00:09:44,400 --> 00:09:45,400
Yes, brain water

188
00:09:45,400 --> 00:09:47,400
I've never heard of it

189
00:09:47,400 --> 00:09:48,400
I don't know

190
00:09:48,400 --> 00:09:49,400
You've never heard of it?

191
00:09:49,400 --> 00:09:50,400
I've never heard of it

192
00:09:50,400 --> 00:09:52,400
If it's omitted, it means it's long

193
00:09:52,400 --> 00:09:54,400
How long is it?

194
00:09:54,400 --> 00:09:55,400
That's...

195
00:09:56,400 --> 00:09:58,400
It's just an image

196
00:09:58,400 --> 00:09:59,400
You've never heard of it

197
00:09:59,400 --> 00:10:00,400
Yes

198
00:10:00,400 --> 00:10:02,400
I think it's unconsciously in your head

199
00:10:04,288 --> 00:10:12,448
While the members with the highest
grades are running the brush, Nakayama,
who is alone, has a relaxed smile.

200
00:10:12,448 --> 00:10:16,288
The correct answer is the Ministry of
Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries.

201
00:10:16,288 --> 00:10:22,368
It's a problem that you can easily
understand if you touch the news a
little bit.

202
00:10:22,368 --> 00:10:27,688
The oldest, Mayama, and the college
student, Hoshina, were correct.

203
00:10:27,688 --> 00:10:31,904
What about the other members?

204
00:10:32,904 --> 00:10:34,904
Kashiwagi, you were faster than I
thought.

205
00:10:34,904 --> 00:10:35,904
Kashiwagi, please.

206
00:10:35,904 --> 00:10:36,904
Me?

207
00:10:36,904 --> 00:10:38,904
No, maybe.

208
00:10:39,904 --> 00:10:41,904
Agriculture, Aquatic...

209
00:10:41,904 --> 00:10:43,904
Agriculture, Aquatic, Aquatic...

210
00:10:45,904 --> 00:10:48,904
It's like a word that even Kei sensei
can't read.

211
00:10:48,904 --> 00:10:50,904
Next, Nakayama, please.

212
00:10:51,904 --> 00:10:52,904
Agriculture, Aquatic...

213
00:10:52,904 --> 00:10:53,904
Aquatic, right?

214
00:10:53,904 --> 00:10:55,904
What does it mean?

215
00:10:55,904 --> 00:10:57,904
Don't ask me the reason.

216
00:10:57,904 --> 00:10:59,904
It's Kei's mood.

217
00:10:59,904 --> 00:11:01,904
We're listening to such a bad thing.

218
00:11:03,904 --> 00:11:06,904
The other members also wrote answers
with a mood.

219
00:11:07,904 --> 00:11:10,904
Everyone, let's watch more news.

220
00:11:10,904 --> 00:11:12,904
So, that's it.

221
00:11:12,904 --> 00:11:14,904
The exam is over.

222
00:11:15,904 --> 00:11:19,904
Now, the results of the Ebi University
entrance exam are announced.

223
00:11:19,904 --> 00:11:25,690
The results of the Ebi University
entrance exam are announced.

224
00:11:25,690 --> 00:11:30,190
The first place is Hoshina Mirei

225
00:11:30,190 --> 00:11:33,690
But not all of them passed 80 points

226
00:11:33,690 --> 00:11:38,190
The disadvantage is Nakayama

227
00:11:38,190 --> 00:11:39,690
It's a reward, right?

228
00:11:39,690 --> 00:11:40,690
Yes

229
00:11:40,690 --> 00:11:42,190
What are you writing?

230
00:11:43,690 --> 00:11:46,190
But, it's not just this

231
00:11:46,190 --> 00:11:47,190
What is it?

232
00:11:47,190 --> 00:11:50,190
This is just a test for your academic
ability

233
00:11:50,190 --> 00:11:52,690
There is a next test

234
00:11:52,690 --> 00:11:57,690
This is not the end of the entrance exam

235
00:11:57,690 --> 00:12:01,690
They don't know why, but they go to the
next place

236
00:12:04,424 --> 00:12:06,424
Hurry up and go home

237
00:12:07,424 --> 00:12:09,424
What's the temperature?

238
00:12:09,424 --> 00:12:11,424
No, it's cold

239
00:12:12,424 --> 00:12:14,424
Don't talk about the temperature

240
00:12:14,424 --> 00:12:16,424
You can't tell the temperature when
you're watching

241
00:12:17,424 --> 00:12:20,424
The Ebichu members are in a large
meeting room

242
00:12:20,424 --> 00:12:24,424
What are they going to do here?

243
00:12:25,864 --> 00:12:33,864
In this series, Ebi University, there is
a system where you can pass if you have
a good one

244
00:12:35,864 --> 00:12:38,864
So we will do a one-game interview

245
00:12:38,864 --> 00:12:40,864
One-game is easy

246
00:12:41,864 --> 00:12:47,864
If you can show us your good one-game,
you will pass the Ebi University

247
00:12:47,864 --> 00:12:53,864
So we invited a special examiner to do a
one-game interview

248
00:12:54,864 --> 00:13:03,864
After graduating from Tokyo University,
he has a long history of joining a world
class company

249
00:13:04,864 --> 00:13:09,864
He has passed many difficult exams, he
is a professional examiner

250
00:13:10,864 --> 00:13:13,864
For some reason, he is a comedian

251
00:13:13,864 --> 00:13:16,864
He is a very crazy person

252
00:13:17,864 --> 00:13:20,864
Please show us your one-game

253
00:13:22,864 --> 00:13:25,864
I will say something difficult in
English

254
00:13:26,864 --> 00:13:27,864
In English?

255
00:13:28,864 --> 00:13:31,864
Her nagi girl meadomis

256
00:13:31,864 --> 00:13:42,864
After the one-game interview, Ebi
University has started to give out one-
game

257
00:13:43,864 --> 00:13:48,864
The examiner will be given a 10 yen
coin, and you will get 0 to 30 points
for the one-game

258
00:13:48,864 --> 00:13:56,096
If you get 80 points for the one-game,
you will pass the Ebi University

259
00:13:56,096 --> 00:14:00,696
Now, we will start the one-game
admission for the Ebi University

260
00:14:00,696 --> 00:14:02,696
Who wants to go first?

261
00:14:04,196 --> 00:14:06,196
If you raise your hand, the points will
be high

262
00:14:06,196 --> 00:14:07,196
It's high

263
00:14:09,196 --> 00:14:10,696
Let's go, Mayama-san

264
00:14:11,696 --> 00:14:12,696
Good luck

265
00:14:12,696 --> 00:14:16,696
First, Mayama Rika will show her one-
game

266
00:14:18,872 --> 00:14:22,872
I'm Mayama Rika from Shiritsu Ebisu
Junior High School, and I'm here for the
Stardust Promotion

267
00:14:23,872 --> 00:14:27,872
I'll be showing you how to remove the
joint on your left shoulder

268
00:14:28,872 --> 00:14:29,872
The shoulder?

269
00:14:30,872 --> 00:14:33,872
Ishii sensei, please touch this and I'll
remove it

270
00:14:33,872 --> 00:14:35,872
Like you're holding an egg

271
00:14:35,872 --> 00:14:36,872
Can I do it?

272
00:14:36,872 --> 00:14:37,872
Here I go

273
00:14:37,872 --> 00:14:42,872
Ah! That's disgusting!

274
00:14:43,578 --> 00:14:45,578
What? What was that?

275
00:14:47,578 --> 00:14:49,578
Pay attention to Mayama's left shoulder

276
00:14:49,578 --> 00:14:51,578
Pay attention to Mayama's right shoulder

277
00:14:51,578 --> 00:14:53,578
It's easier to see if you look from
behind

278
00:14:57,578 --> 00:15:00,578
Mayama's first game, take off the joint

279
00:15:00,578 --> 00:15:08,544
Pay attention to Mayama's left shoulder

280
00:15:09,544 --> 00:15:10,544
Hurry up and tie it

281
00:15:10,544 --> 00:15:12,544
Wow, you can escape from the prison

282
00:15:13,544 --> 00:15:15,544
You can go into a small space like this

283
00:15:15,544 --> 00:15:16,544
Mayama, does it hurt?

284
00:15:16,544 --> 00:15:18,544
Not at all

285
00:15:18,544 --> 00:15:22,544
But sometimes during a live, when I'm
dancing, it goes like this

286
00:15:22,544 --> 00:15:23,544
It hurts

287
00:15:23,544 --> 00:15:24,544
It comes off?

288
00:15:24,544 --> 00:15:27,544
Yes, it comes off and sometimes I get
stuck in a different place

289
00:15:27,544 --> 00:15:28,544
It hurts

290
00:15:28,544 --> 00:15:30,544
You're stuck in a different place

291
00:15:30,544 --> 00:15:32,544
AAAAthrough

292
00:15:33,880 --> 00:15:35,880
I'm sorry, I don't know how to feel that

293
00:15:37,880 --> 00:15:40,880
So, please give us the score

294
00:15:40,880 --> 00:15:42,880
30 points

295
00:15:44,880 --> 00:15:51,880
Actually, when we have a company's
briefing, the first person to raise
their hand is the person who cares about
the content

296
00:15:51,880 --> 00:15:54,880
That's why they are chosen

297
00:15:54,880 --> 00:15:56,880
That's it

298
00:15:56,880 --> 00:16:01,880
Next, Hoshinaga, who is the first place
in the academic test, will challenge

299
00:16:03,080 --> 00:16:05,080
Hold it like this

300
00:16:06,080 --> 00:16:08,080
and stick it together like this

301
00:16:09,080 --> 00:16:10,080
Can you do it?

302
00:16:11,080 --> 00:16:12,080
No, we can't

303
00:16:12,080 --> 00:16:13,080
Normally, you can't do it

304
00:16:13,080 --> 00:16:18,080
Kiya thinks that it's a game that no one
can imitate

305
00:16:19,688 --> 00:16:22,688
My dad can do it, but there are people
who can't.

306
00:16:22,688 --> 00:16:26,688
Since the test tube is ready, the score
is 20 points.

307
00:16:26,688 --> 00:16:32,688
Next, Hiroto will show off his body.

308
00:16:33,880 --> 00:16:37,880
My mother taught me this technique

309
00:16:37,880 --> 00:16:40,880
I do it often

310
00:16:40,880 --> 00:16:43,880
I can make my tongue smaller than a
human's

311
00:16:45,880 --> 00:16:47,880
Pay attention to Hiroto's mouth

312
00:16:47,880 --> 00:16:50,880
It's smaller than you think

313
00:16:50,880 --> 00:16:51,880
I want to try

314
00:16:51,880 --> 00:16:53,880
Can you show me your eyes?

315
00:16:54,880 --> 00:16:55,880
What is this?

316
00:16:56,880 --> 00:16:58,880
It's folded

317
00:16:58,880 --> 00:16:59,880
It's folded beautifully

318
00:16:59,880 --> 00:17:01,880
It's funny

319
00:17:02,880 --> 00:17:03,880
Can you do this, too?

320
00:17:03,880 --> 00:17:04,880
Yes

321
00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:06,880
My father taught me this

322
00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:12,880
I think this technique will continue to
Hirota's children

323
00:17:13,880 --> 00:17:17,880
Is this technique popular?

324
00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:21,880
There are many strange techniques

325
00:17:21,880 --> 00:17:26,880
Yasumoto finally showed off his unique
skill

326
00:17:28,520 --> 00:17:33,520
It's a technique, but there may be a
trick or trick

327
00:17:33,520 --> 00:17:36,520
There may be no trick or trick, right?

328
00:17:36,520 --> 00:17:38,520
There may be

329
00:17:38,520 --> 00:17:40,520
On the contrary, it's new

330
00:17:41,520 --> 00:17:43,520
It smells bad

331
00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:45,520
Is this already started?

332
00:17:45,520 --> 00:17:47,520
No, no, no

333
00:17:47,520 --> 00:17:48,520
Is this already started?

334
00:17:48,520 --> 00:17:49,520
What should we do?

335
00:17:49,520 --> 00:17:51,520
Please liven up together

336
00:17:51,520 --> 00:17:56,416
Ready, go!

337
00:17:57,096 --> 00:17:58,096
Really Hilarious

338
00:18:03,476 --> 00:18:04,756
More, more, more

339
00:18:05,556 --> 00:18:06,776
Whichever is fine

340
00:18:06,976 --> 00:18:07,976
Oh No!

341
00:18:08,436 --> 00:18:10,436
This is amazing

342
00:18:11,956 --> 00:18:13,936
A sharp move

343
00:18:14,096 --> 00:18:21,916
The TV

344
00:18:23,756 --> 00:18:24,336
Ouch!

345
00:18:24,336 --> 00:18:26,336
That's all.

346
00:18:26,336 --> 00:18:28,336
That's all.

347
00:18:28,336 --> 00:18:30,336
Thank you very much.

348
00:18:30,336 --> 00:18:32,336
I think...

349
00:18:32,336 --> 00:18:36,336
Thank you very much.

350
00:18:36,698 --> 00:18:40,698
If it was a relative's uncle, he would
give me 1000 yen.

351
00:18:40,698 --> 00:18:44,698
The hurdle of getting the first game was
high.

352
00:18:44,698 --> 00:18:50,192
This time, Kobayashi's challenge a game-
like technique.

353
00:18:51,192 --> 00:18:54,192
My hobby is drawing.

354
00:18:55,192 --> 00:18:57,192
I draw a combination of animals.

355
00:18:58,192 --> 00:19:01,192
For example, a dog and a duck.

356
00:19:02,192 --> 00:19:10,192
Kobayashi's one-game, Combination of
Animals, is a technique to draw a three-
dimensional animal by combining two
types of animals.

357
00:19:11,192 --> 00:19:12,192
But...

358
00:19:13,192 --> 00:19:14,192
So, Ishii-sensei, what is it?

359
00:19:15,192 --> 00:19:16,192
I'll draw a peach.

360
00:19:16,192 --> 00:19:18,896
Peach!

361
00:19:19,896 --> 00:19:21,896
Peach!

362
00:19:22,896 --> 00:19:24,896
This is a combined creature drawn by
Kobayashi.

363
00:19:24,896 --> 00:19:26,896
Please edit this part out.

364
00:19:27,896 --> 00:19:29,896
Peach!

365
00:19:30,896 --> 00:19:32,896
And you can draw it on the spot.

366
00:19:32,896 --> 00:19:33,896
It's amazing.

367
00:19:33,896 --> 00:19:35,896
It's very impulsive.

368
00:19:36,896 --> 00:19:37,896
It's an originalist.

369
00:19:38,896 --> 00:19:39,896
It's amazing.

370
00:19:39,896 --> 00:19:41,896
It's amazing.

371
00:19:45,896 --> 00:19:46,896
It's amazing.

372
00:19:46,896 --> 00:19:48,896
There's no under-drawing.

373
00:19:48,896 --> 00:19:49,896
It's amazing.

374
00:19:49,896 --> 00:19:50,896
It's very fast.

375
00:19:50,896 --> 00:19:52,896
It's very TV-oriented.

376
00:19:53,896 --> 00:19:54,896
It's done.

377
00:19:54,896 --> 00:19:55,896
It's done?

378
00:19:55,896 --> 00:19:58,048
It's cute.

379
00:19:59,048 --> 00:20:00,048
It's Zozonga.

380
00:20:00,048 --> 00:20:01,048
What? What?

381
00:20:01,048 --> 00:20:02,048
Zozonga.

382
00:20:03,048 --> 00:20:04,048
The name is already decided.

383
00:20:04,048 --> 00:20:05,048
It's good.

384
00:20:07,048 --> 00:20:10,048
With a great performance, she got 40
points.

385
00:20:10,048 --> 00:20:14,000
She got 40 points.

386
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:17,000
But you finally got the sense of the
first game.

387
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:19,000
Yes, I got the sense of the first game.

388
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:21,000
I want to forget about Tejina.

389
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:25,000
That was a good flow.

390
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:30,000
Kashiwagi is aiming for high score with
this flow.

391
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:37,000
My specialty is to make a sound with my
mouth.

392
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:38,000
With your mouth?

393
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:41,000
Yes, I'll do my best.

394
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:42,000
I'll do my best.

395
00:20:44,680 --> 00:20:45,680
Wow, amazing!

396
00:20:45,680 --> 00:20:47,680
It sounded really good!

397
00:20:47,680 --> 00:20:49,680
It sounded better than I expected!

398
00:20:49,680 --> 00:20:51,680
It's amazing!

399
00:20:51,680 --> 00:20:53,680
I thought you were going to use your
fingers.

400
00:20:53,680 --> 00:20:54,680
Me too!

401
00:20:54,680 --> 00:20:56,680
Can you do it with the music?

402
00:20:56,680 --> 00:20:58,680
I'll do my best.

403
00:20:58,680 --> 00:21:01,680
You can do it like this.

404
00:21:02,680 --> 00:21:04,680
The test is going to be tough.

405
00:21:04,680 --> 00:21:11,888
Can they clear this test?

406
00:21:12,888 --> 00:21:13,888
Yellow

407
00:21:15,888 --> 00:21:16,888
Amazing

408
00:21:18,888 --> 00:21:21,888
Can you show us the previous one?

409
00:21:21,888 --> 00:21:22,888
Can you do it in a row?

410
00:21:22,888 --> 00:21:23,888
I'll do my best

411
00:21:23,888 --> 00:21:24,888
Here I go

412
00:21:27,888 --> 00:21:28,888
Yellow

413
00:21:30,888 --> 00:21:31,888
Amazing

414
00:21:31,888 --> 00:21:32,888
I don't know the answer

415
00:21:33,434 --> 00:21:35,434
That's great. Have you done this at a
live show?

416
00:21:35,434 --> 00:21:37,434
No, at a radio show.

417
00:21:37,434 --> 00:21:38,434
A radio show?

418
00:21:38,434 --> 00:21:40,434
This is for a radio show!

419
00:21:40,434 --> 00:21:41,434
A radio show!

420
00:21:41,434 --> 00:21:44,434
I was born in Japan.

421
00:21:44,434 --> 00:21:48,208
That's great.

422
00:21:49,208 --> 00:21:53,208
The winner of the first game is...

423
00:21:56,208 --> 00:21:59,208
The winner of the first game is...

424
00:21:59,208 --> 00:22:02,208
And the last game is...

425
00:22:04,944 --> 00:22:07,944
The academic test is all wrong.

426
00:22:07,944 --> 00:22:10,944
Nakayama is in a big trouble.

427
00:22:10,944 --> 00:22:14,944
I can see the possibility of a big
reversal.

428
00:22:14,944 --> 00:22:19,856
This game is Nein's true into, Game will
continue at istne Progress theres blind
scan game maybe every vibrating music
will soon stop.

429
00:22:20,856 --> 00:22:22,856
I can sneeze without sound

430
00:22:25,856 --> 00:22:34,856
When I'm talking with my manager, I
can't sneeze in this atmosphere

431
00:22:34,856 --> 00:22:36,856
So your manager doesn't notice?

432
00:22:36,856 --> 00:22:37,856
No

433
00:22:37,856 --> 00:22:39,856
Amazing!

434
00:22:39,856 --> 00:22:47,856
No one has noticed this before,
Nakayama's secret, sneeze without sound,
first time to be shown

435
00:22:49,856 --> 00:22:51,856
I can't show it now

436
00:22:51,856 --> 00:22:58,856
I can't show it now

437
00:23:02,056 --> 00:23:04,056
I'm at level 1 now

438
00:23:05,056 --> 00:23:06,056
You just did it?

439
00:23:07,056 --> 00:23:08,056
It's over?

440
00:23:09,056 --> 00:23:10,056
It's silent

441
00:23:12,056 --> 00:23:13,056
Did you succeed?

442
00:23:14,056 --> 00:23:15,056
Takey, you should listen to it now

443
00:23:16,056 --> 00:23:17,056
Only the members know?

444
00:23:18,056 --> 00:23:19,056
Ah, it's out

445
00:23:22,056 --> 00:23:23,056
Ah, it's a 10

446
00:23:23,056 --> 00:23:24,056
What?

447
00:23:24,056 --> 00:23:29,056
Please pay attention to the small
movements of Nakayama's head

448
00:23:31,248 --> 00:23:34,248
Thanks!

449
00:23:36,416 --> 00:23:41,816
She is not able to say anything about
the game.

450
00:23:41,816 --> 00:23:43,456
She has only 10 points.

451
00:23:43,456 --> 00:23:45,576
I don't want to play anymore.

452
00:23:45,576 --> 00:23:48,496
The final score is.

453
00:23:48,496 --> 00:23:57,216
As you can see, MAYAMA, KASHIWAGI,
HIROTA, HOSHINAGA, and EBIDAI have
passed.

454
00:23:57,216 --> 00:24:02,256
And she is suspended from the game.

455
00:24:02,256 --> 00:24:04,496
I only have 1600 yen.

456
00:24:04,496 --> 00:24:05,816
Is that okay?

457
00:24:05,816 --> 00:24:11,016
The shrimp is soft.

458
00:24:11,016 --> 00:24:14,936
The last player is NAKAYAMA.

459
00:24:14,936 --> 00:24:18,696
Please answer with a strange face.

460
00:24:18,696 --> 00:24:22,528
Please answer with a strange face.

461
00:24:23,528 --> 00:24:24,528
Wait a minute.

462
00:24:28,528 --> 00:24:30,528
I want to eat shrimp, too.

463
00:24:30,528 --> 00:24:34,528
Thank you. See you next week.

464
00:24:36,424 --> 00:24:41,424
Next time, it's Hiro and Aika's birthday
solo live special.

465
00:24:41,424 --> 00:24:44,424
I've got a lot of things that I think
are cute.

466
00:24:44,424 --> 00:24:47,424
It's all my exhibition.

467
00:24:47,424 --> 00:24:49,424
Aiai World is open.

468
00:24:49,424 --> 00:24:53,424
What is a live with a lot of cute
things?

469
00:24:53,424 --> 00:24:55,424
That person from the panda.

470
00:24:56,424 --> 00:25:00,424
I'm going to do a live with a lot of
cute things.

471
00:25:00,424 --> 00:25:06,424
I'll see you next time.

472
00:25:27,226 --> 00:25:32,226
This program was brought to you by these
sponsors.

473
00:25:41,458 --> 00:25:42,318
Oh still alive

474
00:25:42,318 --> 00:25:44,318
I did it!
