Program purpose: Let's add "various things" to the idol group Shiritsu Ebisu Chugaku! Such a throwing experimental program "Ebichu ++ (Tasutasu)" has started! !
Shrimp medium + tissue, shrimp medium + curry, shrimp medium + Indian... Ebichu members collaborated on something and verified the results!
A variety show that unpredictably unfolds every time.
Also, in the program, we will introduce the activities of Ebichu research student "Sakura Ebi-zu"!
In addition, a game project in Shrimp was launched. What will be born from the collaboration between Ebichu and the game? ?

Contents of the program: Ebichu members will be given a surprise academic ability test titled Private Ebisu University Entrance Examination. Hinata Kashiwagi, who showed off her foolishness last year, is horrified by the sudden test. The questions on the academic ability test are at the level of common sense learned in elementary and junior high school, but perhaps due to a lack of preparation, Ebichu keeps giving unusual answers.
In addition, this time we conducted a one-skill test. He gave members the chance to score points not only for their academic ability, but also for their special skills. As a special judge, we invite comedian Terumi Ishii, who graduated from the University of Tokyo and has a unique background of working for a top-notch foreign-affiliated company, to test the special skills of each member. Rika Mayama's shoulder off, Ayaka Yasumoto's magic, and other shocking tricks continue. Which member will pass Ebi University?

EBICHU (TASUTASU)
