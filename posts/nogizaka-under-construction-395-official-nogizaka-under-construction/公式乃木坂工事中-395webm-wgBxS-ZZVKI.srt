1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,200
Lap 9 is coming!

2
00:00:07,952 --> 00:00:11,952
I'm Koji Nogizaka, the host of this
show.

3
00:00:11,952 --> 00:00:14,952
I'm Nogizaka-chan.

4
00:00:18,952 --> 00:00:20,952
What is it?

5
00:00:24,952 --> 00:00:27,952
I'm the first.

6
00:00:28,952 --> 00:00:30,952
You are very slow.

7
00:00:30,952 --> 00:00:31,952
What is it?

8
00:00:31,952 --> 00:00:33,952
I'm not alone today.

9
00:00:33,952 --> 00:00:34,952
Really?

10
00:00:34,952 --> 00:00:36,952
I'm scared.

11
00:00:36,952 --> 00:00:40,952
If I fall down, you will have to
replenish me.

12
00:00:41,952 --> 00:00:44,952
I smell something dangerous.

13
00:00:44,952 --> 00:00:45,952
What is it?

14
00:00:45,952 --> 00:00:46,952
Protect your seniors!

15
00:00:46,952 --> 00:00:48,952
The second game battle!

16
00:00:52,952 --> 00:00:58,952
Nogizaka's seniors and juniors want to
be stronger.

17
00:00:58,952 --> 00:01:04,952
The juniors of the fourth and fifth
generation will compete in various
games.

18
00:01:04,952 --> 00:01:10,952
However, if you lose the game, you will
be punished by the seniors.

19
00:01:10,952 --> 00:01:15,952
The battle to protect the seniors will
begin.

20
00:01:15,952 --> 00:01:18,952
The punishment is severe.

21
00:01:18,952 --> 00:01:20,952
Did you hear that?

22
00:01:20,952 --> 00:01:26,952
If the seniors receive a punishment, the
seniors will do more than that.

23
00:01:26,952 --> 00:01:28,952
What are you doing?

24
00:01:28,952 --> 00:01:30,952
What are you doing?

25
00:01:30,952 --> 00:01:32,952
I'm scared.

26
00:01:32,952 --> 00:01:35,952
You were very excited.

27
00:01:35,952 --> 00:01:37,952
I wasn't laughing.

28
00:01:37,952 --> 00:01:39,952
I was serious.

29
00:01:39,952 --> 00:01:43,952
I'm glad to see that attitude.

30
00:01:43,952 --> 00:01:44,952
What about Akimoto?

31
00:01:44,952 --> 00:01:46,952
I'm the last one.

32
00:01:46,952 --> 00:01:50,952
I want everyone to do their best so that
I don't get a punishment.

33
00:01:50,952 --> 00:01:52,952
That's right.

34
00:01:52,952 --> 00:01:55,952
Akimoto is a living legend.

35
00:01:55,952 --> 00:01:58,952
I'm kind because I'm kind.

36
00:01:58,952 --> 00:02:01,952
Akimoto is the history of Nogizaka.

37
00:02:01,952 --> 00:02:02,952
That's right.

38
00:02:02,952 --> 00:02:04,952
Suzuki is the same.

39
00:02:04,952 --> 00:02:08,952
At first, he was like a doll that didn't
speak.

40
00:02:08,952 --> 00:02:11,952
He is a legend.

41
00:02:11,952 --> 00:02:12,952
Thank you.

42
00:02:12,952 --> 00:02:14,952
I met him yesterday.

43
00:02:14,952 --> 00:02:17,952
I met him at the Yamazaki and Saitochi.

44
00:02:17,952 --> 00:02:20,952
He said, please do Suzuki.

45
00:02:20,952 --> 00:02:23,952
He is a legend.

46
00:02:23,952 --> 00:02:25,952
He is amazing.

47
00:02:25,952 --> 00:02:28,952
He is a generation change.

48
00:02:28,952 --> 00:02:32,952
Himura, let's start the first round.

49
00:02:32,952 --> 00:02:36,952
This is a table cross draw.

50
00:02:36,952 --> 00:02:38,952
I will cross the table.

51
00:02:39,952 --> 00:02:43,952
The junior members will add one more
table every time.

52
00:02:43,952 --> 00:02:45,952
They will challenge a table cross draw.

53
00:02:45,952 --> 00:02:48,952
The difficulty level is increasing.

54
00:02:48,952 --> 00:02:53,952
If they fail, the senior members will be
eliminated.

55
00:02:56,600 --> 00:02:58,600
These four teams will be competing
against each other.

56
00:02:58,600 --> 00:03:00,600
Only one member, Pascal, will be
eliminated.

57
00:03:00,600 --> 00:03:03,600
Who will be the one to take over the
survival pressure challenge?

58
00:03:04,600 --> 00:03:07,600
The atmosphere is getting tense.

59
00:03:07,600 --> 00:03:10,600
It's a little scary when it starts.

60
00:03:10,600 --> 00:03:11,600
Endo.

61
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:12,600
Yes.

62
00:03:12,600 --> 00:03:14,600
Yamashita is the one who's going to be
eliminated.

63
00:03:14,600 --> 00:03:16,600
Because we are Yamashita.

64
00:03:16,600 --> 00:03:17,600
We are Yamashita.

65
00:03:17,600 --> 00:03:18,600
That's true.

66
00:03:18,600 --> 00:03:21,600
There's no way we can let an Asadora
actress take over the challenge.

67
00:03:21,600 --> 00:03:23,600
Say something to Yamashita.

68
00:03:23,600 --> 00:03:27,600
I've been on the junior team before.

69
00:03:27,600 --> 00:03:30,600
I know how nervous you are.

70
00:03:30,600 --> 00:03:32,600
So, don't be nervous.

71
00:03:32,600 --> 00:03:34,600
You just have to fail.

72
00:03:35,600 --> 00:03:36,600
You just have to succeed.

73
00:03:36,600 --> 00:03:38,600
If you don't give good advice, you'll be
eliminated.

74
00:03:38,600 --> 00:03:41,600
She was a good senior until the middle
of the game.

75
00:03:41,600 --> 00:03:42,600
She said something strange at the end.

76
00:03:42,600 --> 00:03:43,600
Tamura.

77
00:03:43,600 --> 00:03:46,600
I'm a senior who's been getting along
with him.

78
00:03:46,600 --> 00:03:49,600
I'm sure I can't let him take over the
challenge.

79
00:03:49,600 --> 00:03:50,600
I believe in him.

80
00:03:50,600 --> 00:03:54,600
She was under a lot of pressure.

81
00:03:54,600 --> 00:03:55,600
I believe in you.

82
00:03:55,600 --> 00:03:56,600
Tsutsui.

83
00:03:56,600 --> 00:03:58,600
I'm confident.

84
00:03:58,600 --> 00:04:02,600
Tsutsui, you have to be calm and calm.

85
00:04:02,600 --> 00:04:04,600
You have to fail.

86
00:04:04,600 --> 00:04:06,600
This is Yoshida.

87
00:04:06,600 --> 00:04:08,600
Is this your first time to be on the
show?

88
00:04:08,600 --> 00:04:09,600
Yes, it is.

89
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:10,600
This is bad.

90
00:04:10,600 --> 00:04:12,600
I've heard this from Hazuki.

91
00:04:12,600 --> 00:04:15,600
I heard that the sound of the bell is
like a pentagon.

92
00:04:15,600 --> 00:04:16,600
A pentagon?

93
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:17,600
That's right.

94
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:20,600
The people who got hit are doing this.

95
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:23,600
Two people are doing this.

96
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:25,600
Only Mukai is doing this.

97
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:29,600
This is Ogawa.

98
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:32,600
Ogawa is the youngest.

99
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:39,600
I promised Kaede that I wouldn't hurt
her butt.

100
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:41,600
Aya is different from me.

101
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:43,600
She doesn't spill or drop things.

102
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:46,600
I'm glad you didn't spill it.

103
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:51,600
Kaede dropped this when she was setting
up.

104
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:54,600
I'm glad you didn't spill it.

105
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:55,600
Rock-paper-scissors.

106
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:59,600
The important order is decided by the
result of rock-paper-scissors.

107
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:01,600
I will go first.

108
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:03,600
Tsutsui is the first to go.

109
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:06,600
She chooses a plate.

110
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:09,600
She may fail.

111
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:11,600
Are you ready?

112
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:14,600
Please draw a tablecloth.

113
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:16,600
Please start.

114
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:21,600
She succeeded.

115
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:24,600
It's dangerous.

116
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:27,600
You should not let it go wild.

117
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:33,600
If it was a cup, you would have been
out.

118
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:35,600
I'm nervous.

119
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:36,600
I was scared to put it in.

120
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:42,832
She also added a plate.

121
00:05:43,832 --> 00:05:44,832
Scary!

122
00:05:44,832 --> 00:05:45,832
Really?

123
00:05:45,832 --> 00:05:46,832
Too scary!

124
00:05:46,832 --> 00:05:48,832
Are you ready?

125
00:05:48,832 --> 00:05:49,832
Yes!

126
00:05:49,832 --> 00:05:50,832
The last table cross-hitting.

127
00:05:50,832 --> 00:05:51,832
Go!

128
00:05:51,832 --> 00:05:58,832
3, 2, 1.

129
00:05:59,066 --> 00:06:01,066
This is good.

130
00:06:01,066 --> 00:06:03,066
This is good.

131
00:06:03,066 --> 00:06:05,066
This is good.

132
00:06:05,066 --> 00:06:07,066
This is good.

133
00:06:07,066 --> 00:06:11,066
You are a professional.

134
00:06:11,066 --> 00:06:15,066
Next, she adds a plate.

135
00:06:17,066 --> 00:06:21,066
This may fall in the first round.

136
00:06:21,066 --> 00:06:23,066
Yamashita.

137
00:06:23,066 --> 00:06:25,066
I just have to drop it.

138
00:06:25,066 --> 00:06:27,066
Let's start.

139
00:06:27,066 --> 00:06:30,066
Please cross the table.

140
00:06:30,066 --> 00:06:34,066
3, 2, 1.

141
00:06:34,066 --> 00:06:36,066
Oh!

142
00:06:36,672 --> 00:06:40,732
You're amazing!

143
00:06:40,794 --> 00:06:42,794
Wow!

144
00:06:42,794 --> 00:06:44,794
She was going wild when she pulled it
out.

145
00:06:44,794 --> 00:06:46,794
It's hard.

146
00:06:46,794 --> 00:06:48,794
That's good.

147
00:06:48,794 --> 00:06:50,794
Ogawa.

148
00:06:50,794 --> 00:06:52,794
What's Ogawa?

149
00:06:52,794 --> 00:06:54,794
I was doing it with a school napkin.

150
00:06:54,794 --> 00:06:56,794
Really?

151
00:06:56,794 --> 00:06:58,794
But I've never succeeded.

152
00:06:58,794 --> 00:07:00,794
Oh, no.

153
00:07:00,794 --> 00:07:02,794
Oh, no.

154
00:07:02,794 --> 00:07:04,794
You can set it up yourself.

155
00:07:04,794 --> 00:07:06,794
Wait a minute.

156
00:07:06,794 --> 00:07:08,794
You've never succeeded, have you?

157
00:07:08,794 --> 00:07:10,794
But, I think

158
00:07:10,794 --> 00:07:12,794
you should attack at least here.

159
00:07:12,794 --> 00:07:14,794
It's a hell when you come here for the
second time.

160
00:07:14,794 --> 00:07:16,794
I'll put pressure on Ayame.

161
00:07:16,794 --> 00:07:18,794
I see.

162
00:07:18,794 --> 00:07:20,794
She's putting pressure on Tsutsui.

163
00:07:20,794 --> 00:07:22,794
She's a good writer.

164
00:07:22,794 --> 00:07:24,794
Are you ready?

165
00:07:24,794 --> 00:07:26,794
I think you'll fail.

166
00:07:26,794 --> 00:07:28,794
Please give me a break.

167
00:07:28,794 --> 00:07:30,794
Let's go.

168
00:07:30,794 --> 00:07:32,794
Ogawa's Table Cross.

169
00:07:32,794 --> 00:07:34,794
3, 2, 1

170
00:07:34,794 --> 00:07:36,794
Go!

171
00:07:36,794 --> 00:07:38,794
Wow!

172
00:07:38,794 --> 00:07:40,794
She did it!

173
00:07:40,794 --> 00:07:42,794
She's good.

174
00:07:42,794 --> 00:07:44,794
She's good.

175
00:07:44,794 --> 00:07:46,794
She's good at sliding.

176
00:07:46,794 --> 00:07:48,794
She's good at it.

177
00:07:48,794 --> 00:07:50,794
The second lap.

178
00:07:50,794 --> 00:07:52,794
Tsutsui is going to attack

179
00:07:52,794 --> 00:07:54,794
with a plate with chicken on it.

180
00:07:54,794 --> 00:07:56,794
Yojida, you were thinking about it

181
00:07:56,794 --> 00:07:58,794
when Ogawa cleared it.

182
00:07:58,794 --> 00:08:00,794
I was afraid of the stability of the
eyebrows

183
00:08:00,794 --> 00:08:02,794
after seeing the rattling of the first
plate.

184
00:08:02,794 --> 00:08:04,794
I see.

185
00:08:04,794 --> 00:08:06,794
But, I believe in you.

186
00:08:06,794 --> 00:08:08,794
Well,

187
00:08:08,794 --> 00:08:10,794
will the first victim appear?

188
00:08:10,794 --> 00:08:12,794
The last table cross.

189
00:08:12,794 --> 00:08:14,794
3, 2, 1

190
00:08:14,794 --> 00:08:17,840
Go!

191
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:19,840
This is no good!

192
00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:21,840
You didn't get through!

193
00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:23,840
You're out!

194
00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:26,840
So, the senpai, Uchida, is out.

195
00:08:26,840 --> 00:08:28,840
Thank you.

196
00:08:28,840 --> 00:08:30,840
Who's turn is it?

197
00:08:30,840 --> 00:08:32,840
I'll say it.

198
00:08:32,840 --> 00:08:34,840
Uchida, you're out.

199
00:08:34,840 --> 00:08:35,840
My hand is stuck.

200
00:08:35,840 --> 00:08:37,840
It hurts a lot.

201
00:08:37,840 --> 00:08:41,840
My butt is exploding and I'm crying.

202
00:08:41,840 --> 00:08:42,840
Let's go.

203
00:08:42,840 --> 00:08:47,840
Please!

204
00:08:47,984 --> 00:08:49,984
Now, Tsutsui!

205
00:08:49,984 --> 00:08:51,984
You finally did it!

206
00:08:51,984 --> 00:08:53,984
Say something to Yoshida.

207
00:08:53,984 --> 00:08:55,984
I'm sorry.

208
00:08:59,984 --> 00:09:00,984
Did it hurt?

209
00:09:00,984 --> 00:09:02,984
The time when I was being teased was the
scariest.

210
00:09:02,984 --> 00:09:03,984
I see.

211
00:09:03,984 --> 00:09:05,984
You should have teased him more.

212
00:09:05,984 --> 00:09:06,984
No, no, no.

213
00:09:06,984 --> 00:09:08,984
I thought it was a little bit, but it
was a big one.

214
00:09:08,984 --> 00:09:09,984
I see.

215
00:09:09,984 --> 00:09:11,984
Everyone was saying that.

216
00:09:11,984 --> 00:09:13,984
I was so scared.

217
00:09:16,328 --> 00:09:20,328
3 people left. How many more dishes will
Tamura add?

218
00:09:20,328 --> 00:09:22,328
It's not a attack.

219
00:09:22,328 --> 00:09:24,328
2 dishes are added.

220
00:09:24,328 --> 00:09:26,328
Amazing.

221
00:09:26,328 --> 00:09:29,328
If you clear this, it's a big deal.

222
00:09:29,328 --> 00:09:31,328
I believe in Mayu.

223
00:09:31,328 --> 00:09:33,328
Are you okay?

224
00:09:33,328 --> 00:09:35,328
What are you doing?

225
00:09:35,328 --> 00:09:38,328
I'm used to this.

226
00:09:38,328 --> 00:09:39,328
I think it's heavy.

227
00:09:39,328 --> 00:09:41,328
I'm nervous.

228
00:09:41,328 --> 00:09:43,328
It's true.

229
00:09:43,328 --> 00:09:45,328
She changed her mind.

230
00:09:45,328 --> 00:09:48,328
She pulled the tablecloth.

231
00:09:48,328 --> 00:09:49,328
Please.

232
00:09:57,328 --> 00:09:59,328
She was saved.

233
00:09:59,328 --> 00:10:03,328
I feel pressure.

234
00:10:03,328 --> 00:10:07,328
If I succeed, I will be attacked by
Endo.

235
00:10:07,328 --> 00:10:10,328
That's right.

236
00:10:10,328 --> 00:10:14,328
Endo's challenge.

237
00:10:14,328 --> 00:10:18,328
I think Endo is winning this game.

238
00:10:18,328 --> 00:10:20,328
No.

239
00:10:20,328 --> 00:10:22,328
Endo doesn't think so.

240
00:10:22,328 --> 00:10:24,328
I always fail.

241
00:10:24,328 --> 00:10:26,328
I will change from this year.

242
00:10:26,328 --> 00:10:29,328
I haven't been able to do anything.

243
00:10:29,328 --> 00:10:31,328
I will change from this year.

244
00:10:31,328 --> 00:10:34,328
I will help Yamashita.

245
00:10:34,328 --> 00:10:37,328
I will be successful.

246
00:10:37,328 --> 00:10:40,328
You are excited.

247
00:10:43,328 --> 00:10:46,328
Endo adds a glass.

248
00:10:46,328 --> 00:10:49,328
It's a formation.

249
00:10:49,328 --> 00:10:51,328
He puts the cup in the cup.

250
00:10:51,328 --> 00:10:53,328
It's beautiful.

251
00:10:53,328 --> 00:10:56,328
Yamashita, if you clear this, it's a big
deal.

252
00:10:56,328 --> 00:10:59,328
I think I can do it.

253
00:10:59,328 --> 00:11:01,328
Can you do it?

254
00:11:01,328 --> 00:11:07,328
Will Endo's formation succeed?

255
00:11:09,754 --> 00:11:11,754
You dropped the cup!

256
00:11:11,754 --> 00:11:13,754
You dropped the cup!

257
00:11:13,754 --> 00:11:15,754
You dropped the cup!

258
00:11:15,754 --> 00:11:17,754
You dropped it!

259
00:11:17,754 --> 00:11:19,754
You dropped it!

260
00:11:19,754 --> 00:11:21,754
You dropped the entire cup!

261
00:11:21,754 --> 00:11:23,754
You can drop it!

262
00:11:23,754 --> 00:11:25,754
You dropped the entire cup!

263
00:11:25,754 --> 00:11:27,754
End.

264
00:11:27,754 --> 00:11:29,754
That's a shame.

265
00:11:29,754 --> 00:11:31,754
Good night.

266
00:11:31,754 --> 00:11:33,754
Good night?

267
00:11:33,754 --> 00:11:35,754
Don't sleep yet.

268
00:11:35,754 --> 00:11:37,754
Don't sleep yet.

269
00:11:37,754 --> 00:11:38,384
I'm sleepy.

270
00:11:39,384 --> 00:11:40,384
I can't do it.

271
00:11:40,384 --> 00:11:42,384
Please do it quickly.

272
00:11:42,384 --> 00:11:44,384
No, no, no.

273
00:11:44,384 --> 00:11:45,384
What should I do?

274
00:11:45,384 --> 00:11:47,384
Do you want me to do it when you put
your hands down?

275
00:11:47,384 --> 00:11:49,384
When I put my hands down?

276
00:11:49,384 --> 00:11:50,384
What do you mean?

277
00:11:50,384 --> 00:11:52,384
Do I have to put my hands down and do
it?

278
00:11:52,384 --> 00:11:53,384
That's a lie.

279
00:11:53,384 --> 00:11:56,384
When should I start the play?

280
00:11:56,384 --> 00:11:57,384
No, no.

281
00:11:57,384 --> 00:11:58,384
That's how it feels.

282
00:11:58,384 --> 00:11:59,384
How does it feel?

283
00:11:59,384 --> 00:12:00,384
Let's do it when I put my hands down.

284
00:12:00,384 --> 00:12:01,384
I put my hands down.

285
00:12:01,384 --> 00:12:02,384
Then...

286
00:12:02,384 --> 00:12:04,384
I'm sleepy.

287
00:12:04,384 --> 00:12:06,384
What should I do?

288
00:12:08,448 --> 00:12:10,948
Ready or not, here I come.

289
00:12:10,948 --> 00:12:12,948
Thank you for watching!

290
00:12:13,280 --> 00:12:19,280
She was able to win.

291
00:12:19,280 --> 00:12:24,280
She was worried about her.

292
00:12:24,280 --> 00:12:26,280
Don't worry about it.

293
00:12:26,280 --> 00:12:27,280
She couldn't protect her senior.

294
00:12:27,280 --> 00:12:29,280
She couldn't protect her senior again.

295
00:12:29,280 --> 00:12:31,280
I'm sorry.

296
00:12:31,280 --> 00:12:32,280
I'm sorry.

297
00:12:32,280 --> 00:12:33,280
I'm sorry.

298
00:12:33,280 --> 00:12:35,280
She has said sorry many times.

299
00:12:35,280 --> 00:12:37,280
She has said sorry many times.

300
00:12:37,280 --> 00:12:38,280
I can't help it.

301
00:12:38,280 --> 00:12:43,280
Finally, they will fight.

302
00:12:43,280 --> 00:12:44,280
The last.

303
00:12:44,280 --> 00:12:47,280
3,2,1

304
00:12:47,280 --> 00:12:54,906
The winner is Yuri.

305
00:12:54,906 --> 00:12:55,906
That's amazing!

306
00:12:55,906 --> 00:12:56,906
I'll do two.

307
00:12:56,906 --> 00:12:58,906
And Tamura, who is doing so well,

308
00:12:58,906 --> 00:13:01,906
adds two more glasses and starts the
game again!

309
00:13:01,906 --> 00:13:02,906
One of them has ice in it.

310
00:13:02,906 --> 00:13:05,906
3, 2, 1

311
00:13:11,906 --> 00:13:12,906
Stable!

312
00:13:12,906 --> 00:13:13,906
Amazing!

313
00:13:13,906 --> 00:13:14,906
You're good!

314
00:13:14,906 --> 00:13:16,906
Iwamoto, you're reliable.

315
00:13:16,906 --> 00:13:18,906
You're my friend.

316
00:13:18,906 --> 00:13:19,906
My friend.

317
00:13:19,906 --> 00:13:20,906
That's amazing!

318
00:13:20,906 --> 00:13:23,906
A heated table-cross battle!

319
00:13:24,906 --> 00:13:27,906
Who will be able to protect their
senpai?

320
00:13:28,906 --> 00:13:29,906
I'll do it again.

321
00:13:29,906 --> 00:13:32,906
Ogawa adds another small plate.

322
00:13:32,906 --> 00:13:35,906
There are 11 plates on the table.

323
00:13:36,906 --> 00:13:39,906
What will happen to Ogawa and his
senpai, Sato?

324
00:13:39,906 --> 00:13:45,120
3, 2, 1

325
00:13:45,900 --> 00:13:47,560
AAUGH!!

326
00:13:47,960 --> 00:13:49,400
YAAAAY!!

327
00:13:49,400 --> 00:13:51,400
Out!

328
00:13:51,898 --> 00:13:52,898
That's right.

329
00:13:52,898 --> 00:13:54,898
The plate is also turned over.

330
00:13:54,898 --> 00:13:55,898
What is that?

331
00:13:55,898 --> 00:13:57,898
It's a big one.

332
00:13:57,898 --> 00:13:58,898
It's going to inflate.

333
00:13:58,898 --> 00:13:59,898
Wait.

334
00:13:59,898 --> 00:14:00,898
It's scary.

335
00:14:00,898 --> 00:14:01,898
Is that your first time to use
electricity?

336
00:14:01,898 --> 00:14:04,898
I did it once in the movie, The Beast.

337
00:14:04,898 --> 00:14:05,898
It's different from that.

338
00:14:05,898 --> 00:14:07,898
This is a weapon.

339
00:14:07,898 --> 00:14:09,898
It's a big one.

340
00:14:09,898 --> 00:14:11,898
It's my first time to use electricity.

341
00:14:11,898 --> 00:14:12,898
Wait.

342
00:14:12,898 --> 00:14:13,898
It's really scary.

343
00:14:13,898 --> 00:14:14,898
It's really scary.

344
00:14:14,898 --> 00:14:15,898
It's very painful.

345
00:14:15,898 --> 00:14:16,898
Wait a minute.

346
00:14:16,898 --> 00:14:17,898
It's painful.

347
00:14:17,898 --> 00:14:18,898
What kind of signal is it?

348
00:14:18,898 --> 00:14:19,898
Is this it?

349
00:14:19,898 --> 00:14:21,898
Let's do it with your hands down.

350
00:14:21,898 --> 00:14:22,898
Yes.

351
00:14:22,898 --> 00:14:24,898
Wait.

352
00:14:24,898 --> 00:14:25,898
This is the last time.

353
00:14:25,898 --> 00:14:26,898
The last time.

354
00:14:26,898 --> 00:14:28,898
I'm sorry.

355
00:14:32,840 --> 00:14:33,840
Wait a minute.

356
00:14:35,840 --> 00:14:36,840
What are you doing?

357
00:14:39,840 --> 00:14:41,840
You can change the timing of the button.

358
00:14:43,840 --> 00:14:44,840
It was fun.

359
00:14:45,840 --> 00:14:46,840
Iwamoto clears.

360
00:14:46,840 --> 00:14:48,840
Iwamoto clears.

361
00:14:52,008 --> 00:14:54,008
I will never let my butt get hurt.

362
00:14:54,008 --> 00:14:56,008
It's the best. Let's go eat.

363
00:14:56,008 --> 00:14:57,008
I'm going.

364
00:15:01,008 --> 00:15:03,008
Let's move on to the next game.

365
00:15:03,008 --> 00:15:04,008
Please, Himura-san.

366
00:15:04,008 --> 00:15:08,800
Surface cooperation

367
00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:10,800
The second round of the competition

368
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:17,800
In a container filled with water, the
junior members pour water into each
other's cups.

369
00:15:17,800 --> 00:15:23,800
The senior who spills the water first
will be punished by a sharp chair.

370
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:26,800
This game is a one-on-one confrontation.

371
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:30,800
Can they protect their seniors while
putting pressure on the other party?

372
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:33,800
Takaguchi and Mukai are the seniors'
seats.

373
00:15:33,800 --> 00:15:36,800
I had the image of Mukai until recently.

374
00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:40,800
Mukai, you look good in an electric
chair.

375
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:42,800
Kanagawa, how do you feel?

376
00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:44,800
This is my first time.

377
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:46,800
I don't want to be punished.

378
00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:49,800
Are you okay? You seem to be shaking
your hands.

379
00:15:49,800 --> 00:15:50,800
I shake my hands a lot.

380
00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:51,800
Because you are an alchemy.

381
00:15:51,800 --> 00:15:53,800
Don't say that.

382
00:15:53,800 --> 00:15:57,800
Yakubo and Kanagawa, you two go to the
store.

383
00:15:57,800 --> 00:15:59,800
I'm not going to do that.

384
00:15:59,800 --> 00:16:00,800
The other party is a bowman.

385
00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:03,800
The bowman seems to be reckless and
scary.

386
00:16:03,800 --> 00:16:06,800
Are you okay? You seem to be in a game.

387
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:08,800
I'm different today.

388
00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:13,800
I'm taking care of my seniors.

389
00:16:13,800 --> 00:16:16,800
I want to do my best to repay them.

390
00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:19,800
Did you support your seniors recently?

391
00:16:19,800 --> 00:16:21,800
I think I had something.

392
00:16:21,800 --> 00:16:23,800
I don't know.

393
00:16:23,800 --> 00:16:24,800
The other party doesn't know.

394
00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:27,800
I'm okay because I'm close to my
seniors.

395
00:16:27,800 --> 00:16:31,800
I have the image that you are going to
play a game.

396
00:16:31,800 --> 00:16:35,800
I think I will definitely win.

397
00:16:35,800 --> 00:16:36,800
Are you ready?

398
00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:38,800
I want you to do it freely.

399
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:42,800
The result of the game is decided by
YUMIKI.

400
00:16:42,800 --> 00:16:43,800
Then.

401
00:16:43,800 --> 00:16:45,800
Wait a minute.

402
00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:51,800
I'm afraid I'll do it.

403
00:16:51,800 --> 00:16:52,800
Are you okay?

404
00:16:52,800 --> 00:16:53,800
I'm okay.

405
00:16:53,800 --> 00:16:55,800
Then let's start.

406
00:16:55,800 --> 00:17:01,370
The game starts.

407
00:17:01,370 --> 00:17:02,070
maybe

408
00:17:04,784 --> 00:17:05,784
I will finish.

409
00:17:05,784 --> 00:17:08,784
You cleared it.

410
00:17:09,944 --> 00:17:13,784
I think you can still do it.

411
00:17:13,784 --> 00:17:14,984
Are you nervous?

412
00:17:14,984 --> 00:17:15,904
I'm shaking.

413
00:17:15,904 --> 00:17:17,904
That's dangerous.

414
00:17:17,904 --> 00:17:19,904
You are shaking.

415
00:17:20,584 --> 00:17:22,424
Please send power.

416
00:17:22,424 --> 00:17:24,424
I will stop shaking.

417
00:17:25,424 --> 00:17:27,424
I will stop shaking.

418
00:17:27,424 --> 00:17:28,704
Don't laugh.

419
00:17:28,704 --> 00:17:29,944
I will stop shaking.

420
00:17:29,944 --> 00:17:31,104
What are you saying?

421
00:17:31,104 --> 00:17:32,784
I will stop shaking.

422
00:17:32,784 --> 00:17:35,784
Please believe me, I will stop shaking.

423
00:17:35,784 --> 00:17:37,104
What are you doing?

424
00:17:37,104 --> 00:17:38,464
Don't make me laugh.

425
00:17:38,464 --> 00:17:41,464
I will stop shaking.

426
00:17:41,464 --> 00:17:44,464
Let's go.

427
00:17:47,322 --> 00:17:49,322
Wow!

428
00:17:49,322 --> 00:17:51,322
Wow!

429
00:17:51,322 --> 00:17:53,322
Are you still going?

430
00:17:53,322 --> 00:17:55,322
It's OK. You can go further.

431
00:17:55,322 --> 00:17:57,322
A little more.

432
00:17:57,322 --> 00:17:59,322
Yes!

433
00:17:59,322 --> 00:18:01,322
Wow!

434
00:18:01,322 --> 00:18:03,322
It's getting exciting!

435
00:18:03,322 --> 00:18:05,322
Wow!

436
00:18:05,322 --> 00:18:07,322
She did her best.

437
00:18:07,322 --> 00:18:09,322
Wow! It's getting exciting!

438
00:18:09,322 --> 00:18:11,322
It's getting exciting!

439
00:18:11,322 --> 00:18:12,320
Wow!

440
00:18:13,320 --> 00:18:16,320
The studio is getting excited, too.

441
00:18:16,320 --> 00:18:18,320
Yubuki is going to try the second shot.

442
00:18:19,320 --> 00:18:21,320
Yubuki, Himura, face straight.

443
00:18:25,320 --> 00:18:27,320
Oh, no. They're staring at each other
like monsters.

444
00:18:28,320 --> 00:18:29,320
Let's go. Start!

445
00:18:35,320 --> 00:18:37,320
Wow, that's a lot.

446
00:18:37,320 --> 00:18:39,320
Wow, that's a lot. Is it okay?

447
00:18:39,320 --> 00:18:41,320
Wow!

448
00:18:42,536 --> 00:18:44,536
I'll stop her!

449
00:18:44,536 --> 00:18:46,536
Wow!

450
00:18:46,536 --> 00:18:48,536
Yumiki, you did it!

451
00:18:48,536 --> 00:18:51,536
If I put pressure on her, she'll lose
her strength.

452
00:18:51,536 --> 00:18:53,536
So I'll do it freely.

453
00:18:53,536 --> 00:18:55,536
I see. Don't say it.

454
00:18:55,536 --> 00:18:57,536
It's getting exciting.

455
00:18:57,536 --> 00:18:59,536
It's getting exciting!

456
00:18:59,536 --> 00:19:01,536
Wow!

457
00:19:01,536 --> 00:19:03,536
Kanata, you're next.

458
00:19:03,536 --> 00:19:05,536
This is dangerous.

459
00:19:05,536 --> 00:19:07,536
Even from here, the surface is getting
exciting.

460
00:19:07,536 --> 00:19:09,536
It's getting exciting.

461
00:19:09,536 --> 00:19:11,536
This is dangerous.

462
00:19:11,536 --> 00:19:13,536
This is a battle.

463
00:19:13,536 --> 00:19:15,536
It's a battle. I didn't expect it to be
this long.

464
00:19:15,536 --> 00:19:17,536
I think you should say what you said
earlier.

465
00:19:18,872 --> 00:19:20,872
I'll stop shaking.

466
00:19:22,872 --> 00:19:24,872
Ganagawa's surface tension is at its
peak.

467
00:19:24,872 --> 00:19:34,144
Start.

468
00:19:35,144 --> 00:19:37,144
Wow, amazing!

469
00:19:39,144 --> 00:19:41,144
This is a one-of-a-kind!

470
00:19:41,144 --> 00:19:43,144
Oh no, what should I do?

471
00:19:43,144 --> 00:19:45,144
It's almost over.

472
00:19:45,144 --> 00:19:46,144
I don't want to!

473
00:19:46,144 --> 00:19:47,144
Thank you!

474
00:19:47,144 --> 00:19:50,144
The party will get even more exciting!

475
00:19:51,424 --> 00:19:55,424
They showed us a high level of
performance, but is it finally reaching
its limit?

476
00:19:55,424 --> 00:19:56,424
OK!

477
00:19:56,424 --> 00:19:57,424
This is scary!

478
00:19:57,424 --> 00:19:59,424
But it's fine to end it with one shot.

479
00:19:59,424 --> 00:20:00,424
Right?

480
00:20:00,424 --> 00:20:01,424
Let's go.

481
00:20:01,424 --> 00:20:02,424
Are you alright?

482
00:20:02,424 --> 00:20:03,424
Yes!

483
00:20:03,424 --> 00:20:07,424
It looks like they don't have much time
left, but can Yumiki make it to the next
stage?

484
00:20:07,424 --> 00:20:09,424
You can do it!

485
00:20:09,424 --> 00:20:14,394
Go for it!

486
00:20:14,394 --> 00:20:19,394
I'm still fine!

487
00:20:19,394 --> 00:20:21,394
I can't do it?

488
00:20:21,394 --> 00:20:23,394
What are you going to do?

489
00:20:23,394 --> 00:20:25,394
I'm going to do it!

490
00:20:25,394 --> 00:20:27,394
You're still going?

491
00:20:27,394 --> 00:20:29,394
Really?

492
00:20:29,394 --> 00:20:31,394
It's coming out!

493
00:20:31,394 --> 00:20:35,104
Yes!

494
00:20:35,104 --> 00:20:37,104
I'm OK.

495
00:20:37,104 --> 00:20:39,104
OK!

496
00:20:39,104 --> 00:20:41,104
That gave pressure to Kanagawa.

497
00:20:41,104 --> 00:20:43,104
Yumiki.

498
00:20:43,104 --> 00:20:45,104
You were very aggressive.

499
00:20:45,104 --> 00:20:47,104
You were very excited.

500
00:20:47,104 --> 00:20:49,104
Are you excited?

501
00:20:49,104 --> 00:20:51,104
Thank you!

502
00:20:52,568 --> 00:20:53,568
Let's go!

503
00:20:54,568 --> 00:20:57,568
The third attempt of Kanagawa, a
breathtaking match!

504
00:20:58,568 --> 00:20:59,568
I'm scared.

505
00:20:59,568 --> 00:21:00,568
She's shaking.

506
00:21:00,568 --> 00:21:01,568
It's okay.

507
00:21:02,568 --> 00:21:03,568
Yes! Okay!

508
00:21:08,568 --> 00:21:09,568
It's a face-to-face match.

509
00:21:09,568 --> 00:21:10,568
It's finally the last chance.

510
00:21:10,568 --> 00:21:13,568
The battle is finally the fourth
attempt.

511
00:21:13,568 --> 00:21:22,568
Who will win?

512
00:21:22,586 --> 00:21:24,586
Seriously?

513
00:21:24,586 --> 00:21:26,586
Are you okay?

514
00:21:26,586 --> 00:21:28,586
It's not going.

515
00:21:28,586 --> 00:21:30,586
I'm going.

516
00:21:30,586 --> 00:21:32,586
It's cold.

517
00:21:32,586 --> 00:21:34,586
I'm scared of heights.

518
00:21:34,586 --> 00:21:36,586
I'm scared of getting stuck.

519
00:21:36,586 --> 00:21:38,586
Wow!

520
00:21:38,586 --> 00:21:40,586
This is amazing!

521
00:21:40,586 --> 00:21:42,586
This is amazing!

522
00:21:42,586 --> 00:21:44,586
This is amazing!

523
00:21:44,586 --> 00:21:45,210
I'm scared!

524
00:21:45,210 --> 00:21:47,210
I can't do it next time.

525
00:21:47,210 --> 00:21:49,210
The atmosphere has changed.

526
00:21:49,210 --> 00:21:51,210
It's getting more exciting.

527
00:21:51,210 --> 00:21:53,210
It's getting more exciting.

528
00:21:53,210 --> 00:21:57,024
Thank you for watching.

529
00:21:58,024 --> 00:22:01,024
A battle that's on the verge of getting
heated up.

530
00:22:01,024 --> 00:22:04,024
Who will be able to save their senpai?

531
00:22:04,024 --> 00:22:06,024
It's already sticking out.

532
00:22:06,024 --> 00:22:07,024
It's sticking out.

533
00:22:07,024 --> 00:22:09,024
I can't see the left side.

534
00:22:09,024 --> 00:22:10,024
It's sticking out.

535
00:22:10,024 --> 00:22:11,024
Now, let's go.

536
00:22:11,024 --> 00:22:21,530
It's on the verge of surface tension.

537
00:22:21,530 --> 00:22:23,530
Wow!

538
00:22:23,530 --> 00:22:24,530
One?

539
00:22:24,530 --> 00:22:25,530
Yes!

540
00:22:25,530 --> 00:22:27,530
Wow!

541
00:22:27,530 --> 00:22:28,698
Wow!

542
00:22:28,698 --> 00:22:30,698
What should I do?

543
00:22:30,698 --> 00:22:32,698
It's already shaking.

544
00:22:32,698 --> 00:22:34,698
It's shaking.

545
00:22:34,698 --> 00:22:43,418
In order to bring assurance from the
released soul, a tythi noise source was
retrieved from the room.

546
00:22:44,418 --> 00:22:45,918
Yes, it's OK.

547
00:22:45,918 --> 00:22:46,418
OK.

548
00:22:46,418 --> 00:22:47,418
It's a draw.

549
00:22:47,418 --> 00:22:48,418
It's a draw.

550
00:22:48,418 --> 00:22:49,418
It's a draw.

551
00:22:49,418 --> 00:22:50,418
It's a draw.

552
00:22:51,418 --> 00:22:55,418
The tension is beyond our expectations
due to their excessive concentration.

553
00:22:56,418 --> 00:22:59,418
What kind of result will this battle
bring?

554
00:23:00,418 --> 00:23:02,418
Mukai Sakaguchi is not a child.

555
00:23:03,418 --> 00:23:03,918
It's amazing.

556
00:23:03,918 --> 00:23:04,918
Let's go, Kanata.

557
00:23:04,918 --> 00:23:05,918
Yes, please.

558
00:23:05,918 --> 00:23:11,770
Giri Giri Homen Choryoku Start!

559
00:23:11,770 --> 00:23:14,770
Can you do it?

560
00:23:14,770 --> 00:23:16,770
Can you?

561
00:23:16,770 --> 00:23:18,770
Really?

562
00:23:23,770 --> 00:23:25,770
Yes!

563
00:23:31,770 --> 00:23:33,770
Kanagawa is out!

564
00:23:33,770 --> 00:23:35,802
Thank you for watching!

565
00:23:35,802 --> 00:23:42,802
I thought I wouldn't lose because Yumiki
was going to win.

566
00:23:42,802 --> 00:23:45,802
Sakaguchi, you can win.

567
00:23:45,802 --> 00:23:48,802
My heart is about to explode.

568
00:23:48,802 --> 00:23:54,802
You may be able to win.

569
00:23:54,802 --> 00:23:56,802
I'm sorry.

570
00:23:56,802 --> 00:23:59,802
Yumiki won.

571
00:23:59,802 --> 00:24:05,802
I'm sorry I lost even though I was
stopped.

572
00:24:05,802 --> 00:24:07,802
No.

573
00:24:07,802 --> 00:24:11,802
Is it just no?

574
00:24:11,802 --> 00:24:15,802
I fought well.

575
00:24:15,802 --> 00:24:18,802
I will go.

576
00:24:18,802 --> 00:24:20,802
I will go if I put my hand down.

577
00:24:20,802 --> 00:24:22,802
You should look at it.

578
00:24:22,802 --> 00:24:26,864
What is this?

579
00:24:26,864 --> 00:24:28,864
Here we go.

580
00:24:42,746 --> 00:24:44,746
I was jealous. It hurt.

581
00:24:44,746 --> 00:24:45,746
It hurt.

582
00:24:45,746 --> 00:24:47,746
This is what you were talking about.

583
00:24:47,746 --> 00:24:48,746
Thank you.

584
00:24:48,746 --> 00:24:49,746
I'm glad.

585
00:24:49,746 --> 00:24:50,746
I'm glad.

586
00:24:50,746 --> 00:24:52,746
But I'm a little jealous.

587
00:24:52,746 --> 00:24:53,746
You don't have a star.

588
00:24:54,746 --> 00:24:59,746
Ten-year birthday live's Blu-ray and DVD
jacket is complete.

589
00:25:01,746 --> 00:25:02,746
This is it.

591
00:25:06,616 --> 00:25:08,616
I'm going to eat this quickly.

592
00:25:08,616 --> 00:25:10,616
I'm not good at eating this.

593
00:25:10,616 --> 00:25:12,616
I'm really eating this.

594
00:25:12,616 --> 00:25:15,616
I'm really eating this.
