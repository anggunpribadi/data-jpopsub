1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
I'm nervous about the dress.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:06,000
I'll take care of it.

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:10,000
Stop it. I want to wear a uniform.

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,000
I want to have the best JK life.

5
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,000
How about 17?

6
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:19,000
I don't know yet.

7
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:24,000
The answer is...

8
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000
The answer is...

9
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:33,000
There are two lies in the world.

10
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:38,000
Choose the real one and leave the lie.

11
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:44,064
If you clear the mission, you'll get a
prize.

12
00:00:45,064 --> 00:00:52,064
I might know the basic idioms, but I
don't know the world idioms.

13
00:00:53,064 --> 00:00:56,064
There are people who think in various
ways.

14
00:00:56,064 --> 00:00:58,064
What is this?

15
00:00:58,064 --> 00:00:59,064
It's like a trick.

16
00:00:59,064 --> 00:01:01,064
It's a deep meaning, but I'll tell you.

17
00:01:01,064 --> 00:01:05,064
I don't know the world idioms.

18
00:01:05,064 --> 00:01:07,064
I'll start with the easiest one.

19
00:01:07,064 --> 00:01:11,064
You have to be careful.

20
00:01:11,064 --> 00:01:16,064
The world idiom I chose is real.

21
00:01:18,064 --> 00:01:19,064
It's a sea shell.

22
00:01:19,064 --> 00:01:22,064
The Japanese idioms have a similar
meaning.

23
00:01:22,064 --> 00:01:24,064
It's a year later, and it's a year
later.

24
00:01:24,064 --> 00:01:25,064
I'm in the 7th grade of junior high
school.

25
00:01:25,064 --> 00:01:28,064
Show me this.

26
00:01:29,064 --> 00:01:30,064
I'll choose this.

27
00:01:30,064 --> 00:01:34,064
There are animals, so I'll choose a
scorpion.

28
00:01:34,064 --> 00:01:36,064
I can't think of a hint.

29
00:01:36,064 --> 00:01:41,064
The world idiom I chose is real.

30
00:01:42,336 --> 00:01:43,936
Wah it's over!

31
00:01:44,112 --> 00:01:47,112
Hit the stone bridge and cross it

32
00:01:47,112 --> 00:01:51,112
Who is the member who hits the stone
bridge and crosses it?

33
00:01:51,112 --> 00:01:52,112
Hinata?

34
00:01:52,112 --> 00:01:54,112
Yes, Hinata

35
00:01:54,112 --> 00:01:56,112
Hinata and Mayama

36
00:01:56,112 --> 00:01:57,112
Mayama is the opposite of me

37
00:01:57,112 --> 00:01:59,112
Mirai-chan is quite a strong person

38
00:02:01,112 --> 00:02:03,112
Hello

39
00:02:03,112 --> 00:02:06,112
Please choose the one you like

40
00:02:06,112 --> 00:02:09,112
I was curious about the one with two
elephants

41
00:02:09,112 --> 00:02:12,112
Then, should we choose from the ones
that we can find?

42
00:02:12,112 --> 00:02:14,112
Yes

43
00:02:14,112 --> 00:02:16,112
Let's go to China

44
00:02:16,112 --> 00:02:17,112
Let's go to China

45
00:02:17,112 --> 00:02:19,112
It's like a game for the country

46
00:02:19,112 --> 00:02:24,112
I thought that the monkey and the
elephant were like the country

47
00:02:24,112 --> 00:02:28,016
The world I chose is the real one

48
00:02:29,016 --> 00:02:30,016
It's India!

49
00:02:30,016 --> 00:02:31,016
No way!

50
00:02:31,016 --> 00:02:32,016
I want to know what it is

51
00:02:32,016 --> 00:02:33,016
It's India?

52
00:02:34,016 --> 00:02:35,016
It's India?

53
00:02:35,016 --> 00:02:36,016
It's a cat-nicovan

54
00:02:36,016 --> 00:02:41,016
General storing is something valuable

55
00:02:41,888 --> 00:02:43,888
I think it's a cat food

56
00:02:43,888 --> 00:02:45,888
It's a win for people but not for me

57
00:02:45,888 --> 00:02:47,888
Isn't there something like that?

58
00:02:47,888 --> 00:02:49,888
Young Corn!

59
00:02:49,888 --> 00:02:51,888
I think so too

60
00:02:51,888 --> 00:02:53,888
I really like Young Corn

61
00:02:53,888 --> 00:02:55,888
I really like it

62
00:02:55,888 --> 00:02:57,888
Other members don't like Young Corn

63
00:02:57,888 --> 00:02:59,888
Everyone gives it to Rina

64
00:02:59,888 --> 00:03:01,888
Everyone around me

65
00:03:01,888 --> 00:03:03,888
is a cat food

66
00:03:03,888 --> 00:03:05,888
Even if I get Young Corn

67
00:03:05,888 --> 00:03:07,888
I don't know much about Young Corn

68
00:03:07,888 --> 00:03:09,888
I know how to get Young Corn

69
00:03:09,888 --> 00:03:11,888
I know how to get Young Corn

70
00:03:11,888 --> 00:03:13,888
Which one do you want to choose?

71
00:03:13,888 --> 00:03:15,888
This one

72
00:03:15,888 --> 00:03:17,888
What is it called?

73
00:03:17,888 --> 00:03:19,888
I want to be a mother

74
00:03:19,888 --> 00:03:21,888
Ok, let's go with this

75
00:03:21,888 --> 00:03:23,888
So fast

76
00:03:23,888 --> 00:03:25,888
So quick

77
00:03:25,888 --> 00:03:27,888
There are people from Italy

78
00:03:27,888 --> 00:03:29,888
There are

79
00:03:29,888 --> 00:03:31,888
There are men who are older than her

80
00:03:31,888 --> 00:03:33,888
They say that girl is cute

81
00:03:33,888 --> 00:03:35,888
Mom!

82
00:03:35,888 --> 00:03:36,640
I want to be a mom

83
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:40,640
The word I chose is real

84
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:45,640
Why? Mom will be happy

85
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:49,640
I thought it was real

86
00:03:49,640 --> 00:03:50,640
It doesn't make sense

87
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:51,640
It doesn't make sense

88
00:03:51,640 --> 00:03:53,552
It's really Fukayomi-chan

89
00:03:54,552 --> 00:03:57,552
I was fooled

90
00:04:02,552 --> 00:04:03,552
Let's wear this

91
00:04:04,552 --> 00:04:05,552
Why did you think this was real?

92
00:04:06,552 --> 00:04:07,552
I don't know, I'm just angry

93
00:04:09,552 --> 00:04:11,552
I don't understand the meaning

94
00:04:12,552 --> 00:04:17,552
We walk the same way, and people say
we're weird, but we're weird too

95
00:04:18,552 --> 00:04:20,552
Oh, so you can't see yourself?

96
00:04:20,552 --> 00:04:21,552
It's like you can't see yourself?

97
00:04:22,552 --> 00:04:23,552
That sounds really possible

98
00:04:23,552 --> 00:04:27,552
The world I chose is real!

99
00:04:29,712 --> 00:04:31,032
Yayyy!

100
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:33,680
I'll look at the picture and do it
again.

101
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:34,680
I knew it.

102
00:04:34,680 --> 00:04:36,680
Please open it.

103
00:04:36,680 --> 00:04:38,680
What is it?

104
00:04:40,680 --> 00:04:41,680
Let's go with this.

105
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:42,680
No way.

106
00:04:42,680 --> 00:04:43,680
No way?

107
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:44,680
No way.

108
00:04:44,680 --> 00:04:45,680
Really?

109
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:46,680
You are brave.

110
00:04:46,680 --> 00:04:47,680
Brave action.

111
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:49,680
I don't know what it is.

112
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:50,680
Is it something to eat?

113
00:04:50,680 --> 00:04:51,680
I don't know.

114
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:52,680
It must be a taste.

115
00:04:52,680 --> 00:04:56,680
The world's phrase I chose is the real
one.

116
00:04:57,680 --> 00:04:58,680
What is it?

117
00:04:58,680 --> 00:04:59,680
What is it?

118
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:01,680
It's a face.

119
00:05:02,680 --> 00:05:03,680
I knew it.

120
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:05,552
I knew it.

121
00:05:05,552 --> 00:05:07,552
I like eating food.

122
00:05:08,552 --> 00:05:09,552
Is it about food?

123
00:05:09,552 --> 00:05:13,552
I think it's about food. In Japan,
people who like birds don't like fish.

124
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:16,880
I see

125
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:20,880
What do you hate?

126
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:21,880
Food?

127
00:05:21,880 --> 00:05:22,880
Insects

128
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:23,880
Insects, gross

129
00:05:23,880 --> 00:05:25,880
And shiitake mushrooms

130
00:05:25,880 --> 00:05:26,880
You eat eggs recently

131
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:27,880
I eat eggs recently

132
00:05:27,880 --> 00:05:28,880
You can eat them now

133
00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:30,880
I can eat oyako-don now

134
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:32,880
I hate the soft ones

135
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:34,880
Shiitake mushrooms are also soft inside

136
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:36,880
What do you hate?

137
00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:39,880
I hate celery and Chinese cabbage

138
00:05:39,880 --> 00:05:43,880
I hate them but if I have to choose one,
I can eat them

139
00:05:43,880 --> 00:05:44,880
I like all of them

140
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:46,880
I like fried chicken

141
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:48,880
I like fried chicken more than takoyaki

142
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:50,880
I see

143
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:52,880
What do you hate?

144
00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:53,880
Hakka-kun

145
00:05:53,880 --> 00:05:54,880
Me too

146
00:05:54,880 --> 00:05:55,880
Me too

147
00:05:55,880 --> 00:05:57,880
I hate them

148
00:05:57,880 --> 00:05:58,880
I hate them

149
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:04,880
I brought them

150
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:05,880
I'll leave it to Ono

151
00:06:05,880 --> 00:06:07,880
This looks like it

152
00:06:07,880 --> 00:06:08,880
This looks like it

153
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:10,880
I'll take this

154
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:12,880
I'll take the senpai

155
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:14,880
I'll take the senpai

156
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:16,880
I'll take this

157
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:18,880
This cloth looks like it

158
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:26,688
The world I chose is real!

159
00:06:27,188 --> 00:06:28,048
Please!

160
00:06:28,388 --> 00:06:29,808
Correct!

161
00:06:30,808 --> 00:06:32,808
Do you have a strong family?

162
00:06:32,808 --> 00:06:34,808
Matsuno's family is strong.

163
00:06:34,808 --> 00:06:37,808
My father is the strongest.

164
00:06:37,808 --> 00:06:40,808
I have an image that the three of us get
along well.

165
00:06:40,808 --> 00:06:43,808
I don't have a strong family.

166
00:06:43,808 --> 00:06:44,808
Look at me.

167
00:06:44,808 --> 00:06:47,808
You are a woman.

168
00:06:47,808 --> 00:06:49,808
I'm a man.

169
00:06:49,808 --> 00:06:50,808
I'm a man.

170
00:06:50,808 --> 00:06:54,808
Mom, me, Moca.

171
00:06:54,808 --> 00:06:56,808
Correct!

172
00:06:56,808 --> 00:06:59,808
I'm a cat.

173
00:06:59,808 --> 00:07:01,808
Dad, bring me juice.

174
00:07:01,808 --> 00:07:03,808
Dad is kind.

175
00:07:03,808 --> 00:07:04,808
He always welcomes me.

176
00:07:04,808 --> 00:07:06,808
Dad, do your best.

177
00:07:06,808 --> 00:07:08,808
Do your best, dad.

178
00:07:08,808 --> 00:07:10,808
Are the two real?

179
00:07:10,808 --> 00:07:11,808
Yes.

180
00:07:11,808 --> 00:07:13,808
Is this a good one?

181
00:07:13,808 --> 00:07:16,808
There are two real ones.

182
00:07:16,808 --> 00:07:18,808
It's a three-year-old.

183
00:07:18,808 --> 00:07:20,808
It's a sweet.

184
00:07:20,808 --> 00:07:21,808
Which one do you want to know?

185
00:07:21,808 --> 00:07:23,808
I don't want to know.

186
00:07:23,808 --> 00:07:24,808
Countdown.

187
00:07:24,808 --> 00:07:28,808
5, 4, 3, 2, 1

188
00:07:28,808 --> 00:07:30,808
I'll go with this.

189
00:07:30,808 --> 00:07:33,808
I can't be disappointed.

190
00:07:33,808 --> 00:07:38,560
