1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
I love boy manga.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,500
I wrote my graduation thesis in Jump.

3
00:00:06,500 --> 00:00:08,500
What?

4
00:00:08,500 --> 00:00:13,000
The best grade manga was YuYu Hakusho.

5
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:18,330
I love boy manga.

6
00:00:18,330 --> 00:00:24,330
Hello, I'm Honoka Akimoto, a member of
Team Shachi.

7
00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:28,340
Where do you think I am now?

8
00:00:28,340 --> 00:00:32,940
I'm at the studio!

9
00:00:32,940 --> 00:00:35,540
Isn't it amazing?

10
00:00:35,540 --> 00:00:39,340
And it's the Jump! Editing Department.

11
00:00:39,340 --> 00:00:43,140
When I was recording the nightclub,

12
00:00:43,140 --> 00:00:48,940
I was told that I love boy manga and
jump.

13
00:00:48,940 --> 00:00:53,340
I was brought here by the studio.

14
00:00:53,340 --> 00:00:55,040
Yay!

15
00:00:55,040 --> 00:00:57,740
I'm so happy!

16
00:00:57,740 --> 00:01:04,240
When I left the elevator,

17
00:01:04,240 --> 00:01:08,540
I saw a dream world.

18
00:01:08,540 --> 00:01:10,540
As far as I can see,

19
00:01:10,540 --> 00:01:15,140
all of these are made here.

20
00:01:15,140 --> 00:01:16,540
I'm impressed.

21
00:01:16,540 --> 00:01:18,540
I came to such a place.

22
00:01:18,540 --> 00:01:24,840
I'm going to talk about Jump.

23
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:27,440
I'm going to call him.

24
00:01:27,440 --> 00:01:31,340
He is Sugito, a member of Dr. Roboco.

25
00:01:31,340 --> 00:01:33,940
Nice to meet you.

26
00:01:33,940 --> 00:01:35,940
Sugito Sugito

27
00:01:35,940 --> 00:01:37,640
I'm so happy.

28
00:01:37,640 --> 00:01:40,540
I read Dr. Roboco every week.

29
00:01:40,540 --> 00:01:44,740
I laugh every week.

30
00:01:44,740 --> 00:01:45,740
Miyazaki-san will be happy.

31
00:01:45,740 --> 00:01:47,740
It's really interesting.

32
00:01:47,740 --> 00:01:49,740
What is it called?

33
00:01:49,740 --> 00:01:52,740
It's not a jump homage.

34
00:01:52,740 --> 00:01:54,740
It's a parody.

35
00:01:54,740 --> 00:01:59,740
A parody that doesn't feel any
discomfort.

36
00:01:59,740 --> 00:02:02,740
It's a lot of fun.

37
00:02:02,740 --> 00:02:06,740
It's not just about One Piece.

38
00:02:06,740 --> 00:02:08,740
There are many things.

39
00:02:08,740 --> 00:02:10,740
The most interesting thing for me was

40
00:02:10,740 --> 00:02:15,740
the model of the human body.

41
00:02:15,740 --> 00:02:17,740
The model is Anmika.

42
00:02:17,740 --> 00:02:19,740
That's the most interesting.

43
00:02:19,740 --> 00:02:21,740
I was impressed.

44
00:02:21,740 --> 00:02:23,740
Anmika was very happy on Instagram.

45
00:02:23,740 --> 00:02:25,740
It's not just that.

46
00:02:25,740 --> 00:02:27,740
It's really interesting.

47
00:02:27,740 --> 00:02:29,740
I came all the way here.

48
00:02:29,740 --> 00:02:32,740
Can I go inside?

49
00:02:32,740 --> 00:02:34,740
I will guide you.

50
00:02:34,740 --> 00:02:37,740
Thank you.

51
00:02:37,740 --> 00:02:38,740
Yay!

52
00:02:38,740 --> 00:02:42,592
I will guide you.

53
00:02:43,592 --> 00:02:46,592
I arrived at Sugita's desk.

54
00:02:46,592 --> 00:02:48,592
Look at this!

55
00:02:48,592 --> 00:02:50,592
There are many Roboco!

56
00:02:50,592 --> 00:02:53,592
I'm really curious about this.

57
00:02:53,592 --> 00:02:57,592
Roboco is really made of many goods.

58
00:02:57,592 --> 00:02:59,592
There are also such things.

59
00:02:59,592 --> 00:03:03,592
Yes, Bandai-san has been making many
things for us.

60
00:03:03,592 --> 00:03:05,592
We have been making a lot of things
since before the anime.

61
00:03:05,592 --> 00:03:07,592
The design is also very good.

62
00:03:07,592 --> 00:03:09,592
Yes, it is.

63
00:03:09,592 --> 00:03:12,592
I'm sorry, I noticed that.

64
00:03:12,592 --> 00:03:16,592
Are you making my design?

65
00:03:16,592 --> 00:03:17,592
Yes, I am.

66
00:03:17,592 --> 00:03:24,592
I wrote Roboco on the third edition of
this magazine.

67
00:03:24,592 --> 00:03:26,592
I wrote it on behalf of the editorial
department.

68
00:03:26,592 --> 00:03:28,592
I'm glad. Thank you.

69
00:03:28,592 --> 00:03:29,592
It was written in 2022.

70
00:03:29,592 --> 00:03:30,592
It's quite recent.

71
00:03:30,592 --> 00:03:31,592
Yes, it is.

72
00:03:31,592 --> 00:03:32,592
It's very recent.

73
00:03:32,592 --> 00:03:36,064
Thank you.

74
00:03:37,536 --> 00:03:40,736
So you're in charge of the Robocop's
fighting scenes now?

75
00:03:40,736 --> 00:03:41,736
Yes.

76
00:03:41,736 --> 00:03:43,736
What did you do before that?

77
00:03:43,736 --> 00:03:46,736
I was in charge of the promised
Neverland.

78
00:03:46,736 --> 00:03:49,736
So that's how you got the promised
Neverland?

79
00:03:49,736 --> 00:03:51,736
Yes, you know it well.

80
00:03:51,736 --> 00:03:54,736
Do you know about the promised
Neverland?

81
00:03:54,736 --> 00:03:58,736
The promised Neverland was made into a
movie.

82
00:03:58,736 --> 00:04:03,736
I'm sure everyone knows about it, like
Keiko Kitagawa.

83
00:04:03,736 --> 00:04:09,736
It's a gag manga that doesn't have any
serious feeling.

84
00:04:09,736 --> 00:04:12,736
Yes, it's a gag manga.

85
00:04:12,736 --> 00:04:14,736
I was in charge of both of them.

86
00:04:14,736 --> 00:04:17,736
I was still a serialized manga artist at
the time.

87
00:04:17,736 --> 00:04:19,736
I see.

88
00:04:19,736 --> 00:04:23,736
That's how Robocop was born.

89
00:04:23,736 --> 00:04:24,736
Yes, Enotachi was...

90
00:04:24,736 --> 00:04:27,736
Yes, I was pretty good at that.

91
00:04:27,736 --> 00:04:30,736
I really loved that.

92
00:04:30,736 --> 00:04:31,736
You know the promised Neverland.

93
00:04:31,736 --> 00:04:33,736
I've been reading it.

94
00:04:33,736 --> 00:04:34,736
I've been reading it.

95
00:04:34,736 --> 00:04:37,736
I've been talking about the promised
Neverland with the people in the editing
department.

96
00:04:37,736 --> 00:04:39,736
Really?

97
00:04:39,736 --> 00:04:41,736
There were people who read it.

98
00:04:41,736 --> 00:04:45,736
Robocop was also in the anime in
December.

99
00:04:45,736 --> 00:04:47,736
Yes, it was in December.

100
00:04:47,736 --> 00:04:50,736
I watched it a little.

101
00:04:50,736 --> 00:04:51,736
It was a PV.

102
00:04:51,736 --> 00:04:53,736
I watched the PV.

103
00:04:53,736 --> 00:04:57,736
I didn't expect the voice actor of
Robocop to be Chocopla.

104
00:04:57,736 --> 00:05:00,736
It was Matsuo from Chocopla.

105
00:05:00,736 --> 00:05:01,736
It was perfect.

106
00:05:01,736 --> 00:05:02,736
Yes.

107
00:05:02,736 --> 00:05:06,736
I was asked to come to Miyazaki-san's
place to record a program on Fuji TV.

108
00:05:06,736 --> 00:05:07,736
I see.

109
00:05:07,736 --> 00:05:13,736
I was told that Robocop's voice was like
Matsuo from Chocopla.

110
00:05:13,736 --> 00:05:16,736
I was told to call me if I was in the
anime.

111
00:05:16,736 --> 00:05:18,736
I auditioned properly.

112
00:05:18,736 --> 00:05:19,736
I see.

113
00:05:19,736 --> 00:05:22,736
I liked the director.

114
00:05:22,736 --> 00:05:24,736
It's a short program, about 5 minutes.

115
00:05:24,736 --> 00:05:25,736
It's a 10-minute program.

116
00:05:25,736 --> 00:05:27,736
Yes, it's a 5-minute program.

117
00:05:27,736 --> 00:05:30,736
It's easy to watch, so please watch it.

118
00:05:30,736 --> 00:05:33,736
I want to say what I like.

119
00:05:33,736 --> 00:05:40,736
Robocop's cover is full of jump lines.

120
00:05:40,736 --> 00:05:42,736
Can I see it?

121
00:05:43,736 --> 00:05:45,736
I really like it.

122
00:05:46,736 --> 00:05:50,736
This is a parody of Chainsaw Man.

123
00:05:50,736 --> 00:05:51,736
Is this a Death Note?

124
00:05:51,736 --> 00:05:52,736
Yes.

125
00:05:52,736 --> 00:05:53,736
This is a Death Note.

126
00:05:53,736 --> 00:05:58,736
This is a foot bath.

127
00:05:58,736 --> 00:06:01,736
It's a jump plus.

128
00:06:02,736 --> 00:06:07,736
I recently watched Hunter x Hunter.

129
00:06:07,736 --> 00:06:09,736
Did you just release it 2 hours ago?

130
00:06:09,736 --> 00:06:10,736
I watched it.

131
00:06:11,736 --> 00:06:15,736
I saw it on the Internet 2 hours ago.

132
00:06:15,736 --> 00:06:16,736
I checked it.

133
00:06:16,736 --> 00:06:22,736
The promised Neverland was also in the
first part, right?

134
00:06:22,736 --> 00:06:23,736
Yes, it was in the second part.

135
00:06:23,736 --> 00:06:27,736
The cover of Neverland was not the first
part.

136
00:06:27,736 --> 00:06:29,736
It was in the third part.

137
00:06:29,736 --> 00:06:31,736
It's a parody of the jump cover.

138
00:06:31,736 --> 00:06:32,736
Jump cover?

139
00:06:32,736 --> 00:06:34,736
Who is this?

140
00:06:34,736 --> 00:06:37,736
This is where my mother was.

141
00:06:38,736 --> 00:06:43,736
I was impressed that I could play with
the cover.

142
00:06:43,736 --> 00:06:45,736
Thank you very much.

143
00:06:45,736 --> 00:06:47,736
I'm addicted to it.

144
00:06:47,736 --> 00:06:49,736
Thank you for promoting it.

145
00:06:49,736 --> 00:06:56,634
I want to see it.

146
00:06:56,634 --> 00:07:00,634
Can I see these details?

147
00:07:01,634 --> 00:07:05,634
Is there anything that motivates you
when you work?

148
00:07:05,634 --> 00:07:06,634
Like, something that motivates you?

149
00:07:06,634 --> 00:07:09,634
Like, something that motivates you to
decorate, or something that motivates
you to do this.

150
00:07:09,634 --> 00:07:10,634
What motivates me?

151
00:07:10,634 --> 00:07:13,634
But I don't have any colors like this.

152
00:07:13,634 --> 00:07:15,634
I was doing this with my teacher.

153
00:07:16,634 --> 00:07:20,634
I was doing this because I thought it
would be nice to have my senpai do it.

154
00:07:20,634 --> 00:07:22,634
But recently, I've been doing a lot of
it.

155
00:07:23,634 --> 00:07:25,634
It's a little messy.

156
00:07:25,634 --> 00:07:27,634
I like that.

157
00:07:28,634 --> 00:07:30,634
I like it when everything is decorated.

158
00:07:30,634 --> 00:07:32,634
I've been liking this Roboco lately.

159
00:07:32,634 --> 00:07:33,634
I like this Roboco.

160
00:07:33,634 --> 00:07:34,634
It's cute.

161
00:07:34,634 --> 00:07:35,634
It's cute.

162
00:07:35,634 --> 00:07:36,634
This Roboco.

163
00:07:36,634 --> 00:07:38,634
And this one that the artist gave me.

164
00:07:38,634 --> 00:07:40,634
Wait, wait, wait.

165
00:07:40,634 --> 00:07:42,634
This is the latest one.

166
00:07:42,634 --> 00:07:43,634
Lux Bell.

167
00:07:43,634 --> 00:07:44,634
Can I have it?

168
00:07:44,634 --> 00:07:45,634
Yes.

169
00:07:46,634 --> 00:07:47,634
Lux Bell.

170
00:07:47,634 --> 00:07:48,634
It makes me happy.

171
00:07:48,634 --> 00:07:49,634
It makes you happy.

172
00:07:49,634 --> 00:07:50,634
It makes me happy.

173
00:07:50,634 --> 00:07:51,634
It makes it interesting.

174
00:07:52,634 --> 00:07:54,634
Is this a snack?

175
00:07:54,634 --> 00:07:55,634
It's a snack.

176
00:07:55,634 --> 00:07:56,634
It's a ramune.

177
00:07:59,634 --> 00:08:05,634
I'm surprised that there are so many
funny elements.

178
00:08:06,634 --> 00:08:09,634
There's a desk.

179
00:08:10,634 --> 00:08:12,634
Do you have more things?

180
00:08:12,634 --> 00:08:13,634
Like editors.

181
00:08:14,634 --> 00:08:22,634
I have a manuscript and a desk.

182
00:08:22,634 --> 00:08:24,634
I have a lot of documents.

183
00:08:24,634 --> 00:08:28,634
It's a weekly serialization.

184
00:08:28,634 --> 00:08:30,634
What kind of time is it?

185
00:08:30,634 --> 00:08:31,634
When will it arrive?

186
00:08:31,634 --> 00:08:32,634
It's a serialization.

187
00:08:32,634 --> 00:08:35,634
But I make it in a week.

188
00:08:36,634 --> 00:08:39,634
Do you check it immediately when it's
sent at night?

189
00:08:39,634 --> 00:08:40,634
That's right.

190
00:08:40,634 --> 00:08:41,634
It's a week.

191
00:08:41,634 --> 00:08:44,634
Otherwise, it's a big day of the week.

192
00:08:45,634 --> 00:08:46,634
It's hard.

193
00:08:47,634 --> 00:08:48,634
That's right.

194
00:08:48,634 --> 00:08:49,634
I'm doing it.

195
00:08:49,634 --> 00:08:53,634
I think it's because I have love.

196
00:08:54,634 --> 00:08:58,634
You are a model for a character called
Black Clover.

197
00:08:58,634 --> 00:08:59,634
That's right.

198
00:08:59,634 --> 00:09:01,634
I think you appeared in it.

199
00:09:01,634 --> 00:09:04,634
I'm a character called Kahono in the
temple.

200
00:09:04,634 --> 00:09:05,634
Thank you.

201
00:09:05,634 --> 00:09:09,634
Today is the day off for the editing
department.

202
00:09:09,634 --> 00:09:12,634
There is a person in charge of Black
Clover.

203
00:09:12,634 --> 00:09:16,634
You can see the manuscript of Black
Clover.

204
00:09:16,634 --> 00:09:18,634
If you like, you can see it.

205
00:09:18,634 --> 00:09:19,634
Is that okay?

206
00:09:19,634 --> 00:09:21,634
I want to see it.

207
00:09:21,634 --> 00:09:22,634
Please.

208
00:09:22,634 --> 00:09:24,634
I'll go and see it.

209
00:09:24,634 --> 00:09:25,634
Thank you.

210
00:09:25,634 --> 00:09:26,634
I'll go and see it.

211
00:09:26,634 --> 00:09:27,634
I'll go and see it.

212
00:09:27,634 --> 00:09:28,634
I'll go and see it.

213
00:09:28,634 --> 00:09:29,634
I'll go and see it.

214
00:09:29,634 --> 00:09:30,426
Thank you for watching.

215
00:09:30,426 --> 00:09:32,426
It's amazing.

216
00:09:32,426 --> 00:09:38,426
Fukuda-kun is preparing the manuscript
now, so please wait a while.

217
00:09:38,426 --> 00:09:39,426
I'm looking forward to it.

218
00:09:39,426 --> 00:09:42,426
I really love the picture of Tobata-
sensei.

219
00:09:42,426 --> 00:09:43,426
He is very good.

220
00:09:43,426 --> 00:09:44,426
It's beautiful, isn't it?

221
00:09:44,426 --> 00:09:46,426
It's overwhelming.

222
00:09:46,426 --> 00:09:47,426
I see.

223
00:09:47,426 --> 00:09:53,426
I was a fan of him before he debuted, or
before he made his debut in Black
Clover.

224
00:09:53,426 --> 00:09:54,426
Is that so?

225
00:09:54,426 --> 00:09:58,608
His picture is very cool.

226
00:09:59,608 --> 00:10:01,608
Have you ever seen it?

227
00:10:02,608 --> 00:10:03,608
No, I haven't.

228
00:10:04,608 --> 00:10:05,608
I saw it in a magazine.

229
00:10:06,608 --> 00:10:07,608
You have it, right?

230
00:10:08,608 --> 00:10:09,608
Yes, I have it at home.

231
00:10:10,608 --> 00:10:12,608
I'll show you the picture of the
serialization.

232
00:10:12,608 --> 00:10:15,608
It's amazing.

233
00:10:17,928 --> 00:10:19,928
Fukuda-kun has prepared it.

234
00:10:20,928 --> 00:10:22,928
Thank you for waiting.

235
00:10:24,928 --> 00:10:27,928
I'm Fukuda, a Japanese chef who is in
charge of Black Clover.

236
00:10:28,928 --> 00:10:32,928
Fukuda-san, I'm Hanoka Akimoto. I'm
getting a lot of energy every week.

237
00:10:33,928 --> 00:10:36,928
Thank you. I can do my best because
Ashita is doing his best.

238
00:10:37,928 --> 00:10:41,928
That's right. Ashita is always doing his
best, so Kaba-sensei is doing his best
every week.

239
00:10:41,928 --> 00:10:45,928
I hope you can see the final of his hard
work.

240
00:10:46,928 --> 00:10:47,928
I prepared about 3 items.

241
00:10:48,928 --> 00:10:50,928
Is it a center column?

242
00:10:51,928 --> 00:10:52,928
That's right.

243
00:10:53,928 --> 00:10:55,928
I will explain as it is.

244
00:10:56,928 --> 00:11:02,928
There was a manuscript that displayed
the verb of the recent jump.

245
00:11:03,928 --> 00:11:07,928
I think I can show you this manuscript
directly.

246
00:11:08,928 --> 00:11:09,928
Wow!

247
00:11:09,928 --> 00:11:13,928
This is the cover.

248
00:11:14,928 --> 00:11:15,928
It's amazing!

249
00:11:16,928 --> 00:11:17,928
It's this size!

250
00:11:18,928 --> 00:11:24,928
It is a manuscript displaying the verb
of the 27th year of the 21st century.

251
00:11:24,928 --> 00:11:29,232
It's cool!

252
00:11:29,232 --> 00:11:31,232
The muscles are amazing!

253
00:11:33,232 --> 00:11:34,232
It's amazing!

254
00:11:34,232 --> 00:11:36,232
Do you want to touch it?

255
00:11:36,232 --> 00:11:37,232
I won't touch it!

256
00:11:38,232 --> 00:11:39,232
I won't touch it!

257
00:11:39,232 --> 00:11:42,232
There is Yuno below.

258
00:11:42,232 --> 00:11:47,232
Yuno is drawn in this size and can be
put on like this.

259
00:11:47,232 --> 00:11:48,232
It's a waste.

260
00:11:49,232 --> 00:11:51,232
I want to show this too!

261
00:11:51,232 --> 00:11:55,232
I made various products with this.

262
00:11:55,232 --> 00:11:56,232
I see.

263
00:11:56,232 --> 00:12:01,232
It's cool!

264
00:12:01,232 --> 00:12:02,232
It's cool!

265
00:12:04,232 --> 00:12:09,232
Recently, I have been drawing with
Copic.

266
00:12:09,232 --> 00:12:14,232
There are many artists who can paint in
analog.

267
00:12:14,232 --> 00:12:18,232
I think he is one of the best artists.

268
00:12:18,232 --> 00:12:21,232
What's going on with the people who
choose this?

269
00:12:23,232 --> 00:12:24,232
I don't know.

270
00:12:24,232 --> 00:12:29,232
Do you draw with a pen?

271
00:12:29,232 --> 00:12:31,232
Yes.

272
00:12:31,232 --> 00:12:32,232
I see.

273
00:12:32,232 --> 00:12:34,232
I was in charge of Oda-sensei.

274
00:12:34,232 --> 00:12:36,232
He is good at analog.

275
00:12:36,232 --> 00:12:39,232
I asked him how to draw.

276
00:12:39,232 --> 00:12:41,232
But I didn't know anything.

277
00:12:42,232 --> 00:12:47,232
I didn't know what he was saying because
he drew in 4 colors.

278
00:12:47,232 --> 00:12:48,232
It's amazing.

279
00:12:48,232 --> 00:12:50,232
I see.

280
00:12:50,232 --> 00:12:52,232
It's amazing.

281
00:12:52,232 --> 00:12:54,232
He is a professional.

282
00:12:54,232 --> 00:12:56,232
It's cool!

283
00:12:58,232 --> 00:13:00,232
I like his facial expression.

284
00:13:00,232 --> 00:13:06,232
Recently, I have been drawing with
Mr.Sawa.

285
00:13:06,232 --> 00:13:08,232
I have been watching his videos.

286
00:13:08,232 --> 00:13:11,232
He is getting closer to recent
illustrations.

287
00:13:11,232 --> 00:13:20,232
He is getting better at drawing
techniques.

288
00:13:20,232 --> 00:13:26,232
I think that's why he is getting better.

289
00:13:27,232 --> 00:13:30,232
I like the battle scene.

290
00:13:30,232 --> 00:13:32,232
It's powerful.

291
00:13:32,232 --> 00:13:34,232
He uses a lot of pieces.

292
00:13:34,232 --> 00:13:36,232
I like that.

293
00:13:36,232 --> 00:13:40,232
Mr.Sawa is very good at battle scenes.

294
00:13:40,232 --> 00:13:46,232
He is always looking for a cool scene on
the screen.

295
00:13:46,232 --> 00:13:52,232
I think that's why I can recommend him.

296
00:13:52,232 --> 00:13:56,232
Magic is something that moves.

297
00:13:56,232 --> 00:14:00,232
I think it's amazing that he can express
it with just a picture.

298
00:14:00,232 --> 00:14:02,232
But it looks like it's moving.

299
00:14:02,232 --> 00:14:04,232
I think so.

300
00:14:04,232 --> 00:14:10,232
You have seen a lot of his
illustrations.

301
00:14:10,232 --> 00:14:12,232
Is he one of the best?

302
00:14:12,232 --> 00:14:14,232
He is one of the best in the world of
manga.

303
00:14:14,232 --> 00:14:16,232
He is the best.

304
00:14:16,232 --> 00:14:18,232
He is proud of himself.

305
00:14:18,232 --> 00:14:23,232
He can draw fantasy manga with a jump.

306
00:14:23,232 --> 00:14:27,232
He is a person with overwhelming drawing
ability.

307
00:14:27,232 --> 00:14:30,232
Is it difficult to draw fantasy manga
with a jump?

308
00:14:30,232 --> 00:14:34,232
But I think everyone is overlooking it.

309
00:14:34,232 --> 00:14:36,232
He doesn't have the ability to express
it.

310
00:14:36,232 --> 00:14:40,232
He is a person who has magic.

311
00:14:40,232 --> 00:14:44,232
He is a person who can draw only with a
black and white pen.

312
00:14:44,232 --> 00:14:47,232
I think he has a lot of drawing ability.

313
00:14:47,232 --> 00:14:49,232
That's amazing.

314
00:14:49,232 --> 00:14:51,232
Thank you.

315
00:14:51,232 --> 00:14:55,232
We have one more question.

316
00:14:55,232 --> 00:15:00,232
The final chapter of Black Rose has
recently been released.

317
00:15:00,232 --> 00:15:06,232
Can you show us the special set color?

318
00:15:11,232 --> 00:15:13,232
That's right.

319
00:15:13,232 --> 00:15:15,232
It's a two-piece set.

320
00:15:15,232 --> 00:15:17,232
I've never seen it before.

321
00:15:17,232 --> 00:15:19,232
It's like this.

322
00:15:23,232 --> 00:15:25,232
It's exciting.

323
00:15:25,232 --> 00:15:31,152
Please subscribe to our channel.

324
00:15:31,152 --> 00:15:37,152
This is the final chapter of the autumn-
winter tour.

325
00:15:37,152 --> 00:15:43,152
This black is the final chapter.

326
00:15:43,152 --> 00:15:45,152
This is it.

327
00:15:45,152 --> 00:15:47,152
This is it.

328
00:15:49,152 --> 00:15:51,152
It's cool.

329
00:15:52,152 --> 00:15:54,152
I don't need this.

330
00:15:55,152 --> 00:15:56,152
This is very rare.

331
00:15:56,152 --> 00:15:58,152
It's a vegetable.

332
00:15:58,152 --> 00:16:00,152
This is a soft one.

333
00:16:01,912 --> 00:16:06,912
By entering the final chapter, we could
see the costumes of the ASTAR and Mio.

334
00:16:06,912 --> 00:16:07,912
Yes, it was.

335
00:16:07,912 --> 00:16:11,072
It was a cool experience.

336
00:16:12,072 --> 00:16:18,072
I was worried about drawing each frame
so beautifully.

337
00:16:18,072 --> 00:16:20,072
It's amazing.

338
00:16:20,072 --> 00:16:26,072
Each background is an artwork.

339
00:16:26,072 --> 00:16:39,072
I think this painting is very convincing
even without a background.

340
00:16:39,072 --> 00:16:45,072
It's amazing that you can draw each
frame in a week.

341
00:16:45,072 --> 00:16:47,072
It's a miracle.

342
00:16:47,072 --> 00:16:49,072
It's a miracle.

343
00:16:49,072 --> 00:16:51,072
It's cool.

344
00:16:51,072 --> 00:16:53,072
You are a Yuno-fan.

345
00:16:53,072 --> 00:16:56,072
I'm sorry.

346
00:16:56,072 --> 00:16:58,072
I didn't say that.

347
00:16:58,072 --> 00:17:00,072
You said that you were a Yuno-fan.

348
00:17:00,072 --> 00:17:02,072
I'm a Yuno-fan.

349
00:17:02,072 --> 00:17:07,072
I'm getting the energy from you.

350
00:17:07,072 --> 00:17:09,072
Yuno is a good person.

351
00:17:09,072 --> 00:17:11,072
He is cool.

352
00:17:11,072 --> 00:17:13,072
He is a genius.

353
00:17:13,072 --> 00:17:15,072
He is a genius.

354
00:17:15,072 --> 00:17:16,072
He is a good person.

355
00:17:16,072 --> 00:17:18,072
He is a genius.

356
00:17:18,072 --> 00:17:21,072
He is born to be a genius.

357
00:17:21,072 --> 00:17:25,072
But he is a good person because he
recognizes you.

358
00:17:25,072 --> 00:17:28,072
I love Yuno who loves you.

359
00:17:28,072 --> 00:17:31,072
That's right.

360
00:17:31,072 --> 00:17:33,072
I love you the most.

361
00:17:33,072 --> 00:17:36,072
I love you who loves me.

362
00:17:36,072 --> 00:17:39,072
I will say that from now on.

363
00:17:39,072 --> 00:17:42,072
Thank you very much.

364
00:17:42,072 --> 00:17:44,072
It's amazing.

365
00:17:44,072 --> 00:17:49,081
Thank you very much.
