The second half of the year-end grand prix will be held during Nogizaka construction this time! The 5th generation members will choose one senior member who helped them the most this year and give them a year-end gift to show their gratitude!

Senior members can run if they think they deserve it! Accept the feelings of your juniors and aim for mutual love! But their feelings are different! More and more members are getting dumped! ? And the tears of the juniors who can't relate to each other can't stop crying! ? 

Studio in great turmoil! Will they make a wonderful couple? ?

Appearance
Bananaman Nogizaka46
