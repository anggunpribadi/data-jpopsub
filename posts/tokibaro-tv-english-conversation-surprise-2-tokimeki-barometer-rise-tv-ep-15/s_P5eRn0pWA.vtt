00:02.000 --> 00:04.000
 Next is...

00:04.000 --> 00:08.000
 Kanamin and Oharu's prank.

00:08.000 --> 00:11.000
 I was the last one to get pranked.

00:11.000 --> 00:12.000
 Oh, yeah.

00:12.000 --> 00:14.000
 We haven't done the one where we watch.

00:15.000 --> 00:16.000
 I'm looking forward to it.

00:16.000 --> 00:17.000
 I wonder how it will be.

00:17.000 --> 00:19.000
 Kanamin and Oharu's...

00:19.000 --> 00:25.000
 I'm looking forward to seeing Kanamin's
natural beauty.

00:25.000 --> 00:26.000
 Be careful.

00:26.000 --> 00:27.000
 Be careful.

00:28.000 --> 00:29.000
 It's coming.

00:29.000 --> 00:29.664
 Please watch it.

00:29.664 --> 00:32.664
 We are not passing by each other.

00:37.216 --> 00:41.216
 Oh, I'm sorry. I think this is my room.

00:41.216 --> 00:42.216
 Oh!

00:42.216 --> 00:46.216
 I think so. I have a meeting here.

00:46.216 --> 00:48.216
 Later.

00:48.216 --> 00:52.216
 Yeah, later. I have a meeting here. I
think later.

00:52.216 --> 01:09.216
 Do you have a meeting here?

01:10.560 --> 01:14.560
 This program is a program where six
people who are active to promote
something exciting

01:14.560 --> 01:20.560
 are challenged to various things and
raise the excitement barometer in the
world.

01:40.000 --> 01:44.800
でも歯を食いしばってる

01:45.100 --> 01:48.060
 そうがましゃらに

01:51.860 --> 01:54.000
 Your Japanese Idol

02:03.792 --> 02:05.792
 I'm going to promote a lot at the
Olympics

02:33.792 --> 02:35.792
 Meaning?

02:35.792 --> 02:37.792
 Promote something exciting

02:45.168 --> 02:47.168
 I can't say anything.

03:16.168 --> 03:17.868
 Public?

03:17.868 --> 03:23.868
 What is tokimeki? Tokimeki means
publicity.

03:25.664 --> 03:27.664
 Yes!

03:27.664 --> 03:29.664
 Yes!

03:29.664 --> 03:31.664
 So Kimetsu Kisen de means publicity.

03:31.664 --> 03:33.664
 Publicity.

03:33.664 --> 03:37.664
 Okay, this is your group.

03:37.664 --> 03:39.664

 So, your color is blue.

04:42.568 --> 04:43.568
 Blue.

04:43.568 --> 04:45.568
 Is that your favorite color?

04:45.568 --> 04:47.552
 Pink.

04:47.552 --> 04:49.552
 Oh, that's your color.

04:50.552 --> 04:52.552
 What's your favorite color?

04:52.552 --> 04:54.552
 I like black.

04:56.552 --> 04:58.552
 But nobody's black.

04:58.552 --> 05:00.552
 It's not, it's not bright.

05:01.552 --> 05:04.552
 Okay, wait, so what's your hobby?

 I think it's a hobby.

05:20.464 --> 05:22.464
 I play guitar.

05:22.464 --> 05:24.464
 Oh really? In the group?

05:24.464 --> 05:26.464
 In the band?

05:26.464 --> 05:28.464
 Ummm...

05:28.464 --> 05:30.464
 Ummm...

05:30.464 --> 05:32.464
 How do I say it?

05:32.464 --> 05:34.464
 Ummm...

05:34.464 --> 05:36.464
 Yes.

05:36.464 --> 05:38.464
 In the band?

05:38.464 --> 05:40.464
 Oh, cool.

05:40.464 --> 05:42.464
 Okay, what's your hobby?

05:42.464 --> 05:44.464
 Swimming.

05:44.464 --> 05:45.040
 Swimming.

05:45.040 --> 05:48.440
 Oh, swimming? Do you swim in the music
video?

05:48.440 --> 05:50.440
 No.

05:50.440 --> 05:54.040
 No? But you play the guitar in the
music video.

05:54.040 --> 05:54.540
 Yes.

05:54.540 --> 05:56.540
 No, music video, no.

05:56.540 --> 05:58.040
 There's no music video?

05:58.040 --> 05:58.540
 Yes.

05:58.540 --> 06:02.040
 What's your everyday routine?

06:03.040 --> 06:04.540
 Everyday?

06:04.540 --> 06:08.540
 What do you do everyday? What's your
everyday routine?

06:08.540 --> 06:10.540
 Everyday...

06:10.540 --> 06:12.540
 What do you do?

06:12.540 --> 06:13.040
 No.

06:13.056 --> 06:15.936
 What does Kana mean to you? Everyday
routine?

06:19.056 --> 06:23.376
 Like in the morning, in the afternoon,
at night time?

06:23.376 --> 06:24.736
 Everyday.

06:24.736 --> 06:26.336
 Everyday.

06:31.136 --> 06:32.096
 Dance?

06:32.096 --> 06:34.976
 Wow, really? Everyday?

06:34.976 --> 06:36.976
 Everyday dancing?

06:36.976 --> 06:38.976
 For this group?

06:38.976 --> 06:40.976
 Wow, everyday.

06:40.976 --> 06:42.160
 Uh...

06:42.160 --> 06:47.160
 By the way, do you know that right now
this is a prank?

06:47.160 --> 06:49.160
 Now, right now.

06:49.160 --> 06:51.160
 This is a prank.

06:51.160 --> 06:53.160
 Prank?

06:53.160 --> 06:55.160
 Like a trick.

06:55.160 --> 06:57.160
 But it's okay. I'll explain.

06:57.160 --> 06:59.160
 I don't think you know.

06:59.160 --> 07:01.160
 I'll explain later.

07:01.160 --> 07:03.160
 Sorry.

07:03.160 --> 07:05.160
 Back to what kind of song?

07:05.160 --> 07:07.160
 What songs do you sing?

07:07.160 --> 07:09.160
 I like music.

07:09.160 --> 07:12.160
 Music?

07:14.874 --> 07:16.874
 Spring Good

07:42.912 --> 07:44.912
 Wait, one more time.

07:54.912 --> 07:56.912
 Okay, that's cool.

07:56.912 --> 07:59.912
 What's your dream? Your future dream?

07:59.912 --> 08:00.912
 Dream?

08:00.912 --> 08:01.912
 Dream.

08:03.912 --> 08:05.912
 Go to Budokan.

08:05.912 --> 08:06.912
 What's Budokan?

08:06.912 --> 08:10.448
 Nippon Budokan Live at Home.

08:11.448 --> 08:14.448
 Oh, there's a big performance.

08:14.448 --> 08:16.448
 Yes, yes, yes.

08:16.448 --> 08:17.448
 Oh, okay.

08:25.818 --> 08:27.878
 They got it right!

08:30.336 --> 08:32.336
 Speak? Speak in English?

08:32.336 --> 08:34.336
 No!

08:34.336 --> 08:36.336
 No!

08:36.336 --> 08:38.336
 No?

08:38.336 --> 08:40.336
 Kanami, no!

08:40.336 --> 08:42.336
 Suimin,

08:42.336 --> 08:44.336
 What did you say?

08:44.336 --> 08:46.336
 What did I say?

08:46.336 --> 08:48.336
 What was it?

08:48.336 --> 08:50.336
 Oharu can speak English,

08:50.336 --> 08:52.336
 so I wanted to attack Kanami,

08:52.336 --> 08:54.336
 but Oharu is smart,

08:54.336 --> 08:56.336
 so I wanted to help her.

08:56.336 --> 08:58.336
 She's not smart,

08:58.336 --> 09:00.336
 so I thought I should attack her.

09:12.080 --> 09:17.080
 It's a dream co-star.

09:22.080 --> 09:25.080
 I might be caught if I go in here.

09:26.080 --> 09:28.080
 I'm climbing up.

09:29.080 --> 09:34.080
 It's been 3 years since I met Nacchan.

09:35.080 --> 09:36.080
 3 years?

09:37.080 --> 09:39.080
 It's my first time.

09:39.080 --> 09:41.080
 It's my first time.

09:42.080 --> 09:45.080
 She bought it for my birthday.

09:46.080 --> 09:51.080
 She prepared it for me.

09:52.080 --> 09:53.080
 It's cool.

09:56.080 --> 09:57.080
 It's a match.

10:04.080 --> 10:07.080
 She was upside down.

10:07.080 --> 10:12.080
 We all helped her.

10:13.080 --> 10:14.080
 Thank you.

10:14.080 --> 10:16.080
 This is normal.

10:16.080 --> 10:17.080
 It's beautiful.

10:21.080 --> 10:23.080
 I'll eat it.

10:24.080 --> 10:25.080
 It hurts.

10:26.080 --> 10:28.080
 It's soft.

10:28.080 --> 10:29.080
 I'll eat it.

10:29.080 --> 10:32.080
 It's elastic.

10:34.080 --> 10:37.080
 It tastes like matcha.

10:38.080 --> 10:39.080
 It's smooth.

10:40.080 --> 10:42.080
 It's not too sweet.

10:43.080 --> 10:44.080
 Thank you.

10:44.080 --> 11:02.080
