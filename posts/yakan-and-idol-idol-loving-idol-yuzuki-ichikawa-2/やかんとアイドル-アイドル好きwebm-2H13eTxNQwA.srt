00:00:15,314 --> 00:00:17,314
Thank you!

8
00:00:19,130 --> 00:00:23,930
Now, it's time to introduce the three
elements that make up Yuzuki Ichikawa.

9
00:00:24,030 --> 00:00:29,530
Let's learn more about our guest idol.

10
00:00:29,630 --> 00:00:32,730
Can you tell us the three elements?

11
00:00:32,830 --> 00:00:34,430
Yes, I'm ready.

12
00:00:35,230 --> 00:00:35,730
Ready?

13
00:00:35,830 --> 00:00:36,830
Yes, please.

14
00:00:36,930 --> 00:00:38,330
Here we go.

15
00:00:38,430 --> 00:00:39,230
Ta-da!

16
00:00:39,330 --> 00:00:40,330
Ta-da!

17
00:00:40,830 --> 00:00:42,230
The first element is...

18
00:00:42,330 --> 00:00:43,030
talking.

19
00:00:43,130 --> 00:00:44,030
Talking.

20
00:00:44,130 --> 00:00:45,630
The second element is...

21
00:00:45,730 --> 00:00:46,230
friends.

22
00:00:46,330 --> 00:00:47,230
Friends.

23
00:00:47,230 --> 00:00:49,072
The third element is...

24
00:00:50,072 --> 00:00:52,072
That's it.

25
00:00:52,072 --> 00:00:56,072
Then, please explain one by one.

26
00:00:56,072 --> 00:01:01,072
Thank you for watching.

27
00:01:01,466 --> 00:01:04,466
The first is talking.

28
00:01:04,466 --> 00:01:12,466
I have the image that you talk a lot and
do various things on the spot, but do
you really like talking?

29
00:01:12,466 --> 00:01:18,466
I like talking, not being good at MC,
but I really like talking.

30
00:01:18,466 --> 00:01:21,466
I want to talk to someone all the time.

31
00:01:21,466 --> 00:01:29,466
I'm talking to someone all the time
during my break time.

32
00:01:29,466 --> 00:01:33,466
Who is the one who talks the most in the
group?

33
00:01:33,466 --> 00:01:36,466
Who is it?

34
00:01:36,466 --> 00:01:38,466
Is it a secret?

35
00:01:38,466 --> 00:01:41,466
Aira talks a lot, too.

36
00:01:41,466 --> 00:01:46,466
I like talking, so I talk to her during
my break time.

37
00:01:46,466 --> 00:01:51,466
Hana likes to play jokes, so we play
jokes while talking together.

38
00:01:51,466 --> 00:01:53,466
Moeka is quiet.

39
00:01:53,466 --> 00:01:55,466
I'm not talking.

40
00:01:55,466 --> 00:02:00,466
I'm laughing at that.

41
00:02:00,466 --> 00:02:04,466
What do you talk about?

42
00:02:04,466 --> 00:02:11,466
I'm talking about things that I can't
remember forever.

43
00:02:11,466 --> 00:02:14,466
I'm not good at silence.

44
00:02:14,466 --> 00:02:15,466
I'm not good at silence.

45
00:02:15,466 --> 00:02:19,466
I'm not good at that scene.

46
00:02:19,466 --> 00:02:22,466
I'm afraid of that scene every time.

47
00:02:22,466 --> 00:02:30,466
I'm afraid of the 1-2 second scene.

48
00:02:30,466 --> 00:02:35,466
I'm afraid of looking back on the
broadcast.

49
00:02:35,466 --> 00:02:40,466
I'm worried about that scene, so I talk
a lot.

50
00:02:40,466 --> 00:02:45,466
Do you talk to your fans at the special
event?

51
00:02:45,466 --> 00:02:50,466
There is a rule that the special event
is held for a few seconds.

52
00:02:50,466 --> 00:02:53,466
I don't have enough time to talk.

53
00:02:53,466 --> 00:02:54,466
I see.

54
00:02:54,466 --> 00:02:57,466
I want you to wait.

55
00:02:57,466 --> 00:03:01,466
I don't have enough time to talk, but
I'm going home because I'm told I'm
late.

56
00:03:01,466 --> 00:03:04,466
I want you to wait a little.

57
00:03:04,466 --> 00:03:08,466
It's not bad for the audience.

58
00:03:08,466 --> 00:03:12,466
I want to talk to you and the audience.

59
00:03:12,466 --> 00:03:15,466
The audience looks very unpleasant.

60
00:03:15,466 --> 00:03:16,466
I've never heard of that.

61
00:03:16,466 --> 00:03:20,466
I'm going home with a bad face because
I'm told I'm late.

62
00:03:20,466 --> 00:03:24,466
I'm talking all the time, so the staff
is late.

63
00:03:24,466 --> 00:03:26,466
The staff is late.

64
00:03:26,466 --> 00:03:33,466
I was scolded by the staff because I was
talking on Twitter.

65
00:03:33,466 --> 00:03:36,466
That's the worst spiral.

66
00:03:36,466 --> 00:03:38,466
I'm sorry.

67
00:03:38,466 --> 00:03:40,466
I'm sorry I said I was late.

68
00:03:40,466 --> 00:03:44,466
I'm sorry I talked to you all the time.

69
00:03:44,466 --> 00:03:46,466
I was scolded by the staff, so I said,
stop.

70
00:03:46,466 --> 00:03:53,616
I talk so much that the audience hates
me.

71
00:03:54,616 --> 00:03:56,616
But Mario Kart is good.

72
00:03:56,616 --> 00:03:58,616
Oh, is that so? Then it's okay.

73
00:03:58,616 --> 00:03:59,616
Can I go?

74
00:03:59,616 --> 00:04:01,616
If Mario Kart is okay, it's okay.

75
00:04:04,616 --> 00:04:06,616
This program is

76
00:04:07,616 --> 00:04:09,616
Pyonpyon Mano-chan

77
00:04:10,616 --> 00:04:12,616
Yuzu-chan Toshikazu

78
00:04:13,616 --> 00:04:15,616
Naoto Osaka

79
00:04:15,616 --> 00:04:18,960
Kamugichi-san

80
00:04:18,960 --> 00:04:21,960
This video is brought to you by Myon-no-
shi.

81
00:04:21,960 --> 00:04:27,061
Thank you very much.
