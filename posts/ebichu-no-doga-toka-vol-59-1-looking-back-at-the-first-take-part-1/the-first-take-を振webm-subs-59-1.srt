1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Ebichu's videos!

2
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:18,000
I was a fan of First Take, so I was very
happy to see Ebichu.

3
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:22,000
At the same time, I had a question.

4
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:28,000
I was really curious about First Take.

5
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:33,000
When I recorded it, it was really the
first take.

6
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:36,000
I was so nervous.

7
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:42,000
I thought I'd never been so nervous.

8
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:46,000
I was sweating like crazy.

9
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
I was really nervous.

10
00:00:48,000 --> 00:01:00,000
I didn't expect to be able to
participate in a wonderful project
called First Take with six people.

11
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:11,000
I'm glad that I was able to finish it in
the form that will remain in the form of
the last six people.

12
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:14,000
How was it to be able to participate in
the first take?

13
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:20,000
The period of time I was able to
participate with six people was probably
short.

14
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:24,000
I couldn't show it in a proper way.

15
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:35,000
In that sense, I think it was a very
long period of time because I was
particular about the number six because
the period of time I was able to
participate with six people was short.

16
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:41,000
And I was happy to show it to you at the
end.

17
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:50,000
I was able to participate with six
people.

18
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:55,000
It was similar to how I felt when I was
shooting my graduation album.

19
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,000
How did you feel when you were able to
participate in the first take?

20
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:08,000
Ayaka was able to take a breath when she
was able to participate in the first
take.

21
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:11,000
I was very happy at that moment.

22
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:16,000
I was happier than when I was singing.

23
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
How did you feel when you were able to
participate in the first take?

24
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:26,000
I was very impressed that many people
kept the shrimp-chewed in their hearts.

25
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:29,000
I was very happy.

26
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:41,000
I was able to participate in the first
take because of everyone's support.

27
00:02:41,346 --> 00:02:54,706
I was so happy to hear that they were
all saying that the path we are
supporting is such a wonderful idol.

28
00:02:54,706 --> 00:03:00,146
I felt everyone's power.

29
00:03:00,146 --> 00:03:02,446
How do you feel about the new team?

30
00:03:02,446 --> 00:03:12,146
The new team is actually starting, but
the 3 of us will be recording our first
performance at the fan meeting.

31
00:03:12,146 --> 00:03:14,906
I want to be like this.

32
00:03:14,906 --> 00:03:21,586
It's a story of the 6th generation, but
there's no clear goal in Ebichu.

33
00:03:21,586 --> 00:03:24,306
I want to make it.

34
00:03:24,306 --> 00:03:31,606
We had a meeting and then we talked
about not aiming for Meiji Jingu.

35
00:03:31,606 --> 00:03:37,146
I think it's a very clear path for an
idol to understand.

36
00:03:37,146 --> 00:03:38,786
Is there a song program you want to
appear on?

37
00:03:38,786 --> 00:03:42,006
Or is there a venue you want to perform
at?

38
00:03:42,006 --> 00:03:46,846
I think it's a very clear goal that I
wanted to give them.

39
00:03:46,846 --> 00:03:50,086
I want to perform at Jingu Stadium.

40
00:03:50,086 --> 00:03:54,886
And for that, I want to work more hard
next year.

41
00:03:54,886 --> 00:04:02,786
I think this year will be the year of
the seeding.

42
00:04:02,786 --> 00:04:12,286
First of all, I want to make the fan
meeting successful and make everyone say
that the 9 members of Ebichu are also
fun.

43
00:04:12,286 --> 00:04:29,386
And if we can share fun and happiness
with everyone at the live performance,
we will be able to become a better
group.

44
00:04:29,386 --> 00:04:42,686
I hope that we can go to Meiji Jingu
Stadium with everyone in Ebichu Family.

45
00:04:42,686 --> 00:04:48,286
I thought about Akarin's warehouse at
the music festival, but it's really hot
in the evening.

46
00:04:48,286 --> 00:04:56,786
First of all, I want to take good care
of my health and perform carefully so
that I don't get sick.

47
00:04:56,786 --> 00:05:00,486
I would be happy if I could share fun
with everyone.

48
00:05:00,486 --> 00:05:04,486
What is your plan for the live
performance?

49
00:05:04,486 --> 00:05:09,586
At first, I didn't plan to return to the
stage.

50
00:05:09,586 --> 00:05:12,786
I was planning to return to the stage at
the live performance.

51
00:05:12,786 --> 00:05:12,834
Thank you for your viewing.

52
00:05:12,834 --> 00:05:17,914
I talked to the star Sonny and Fujii

53
00:05:17,914 --> 00:05:24,434
and decided to try it or enter the
competition.

54
00:05:24,434 --> 00:05:31,074
I didn't think that would be the return
line.

55
00:05:31,074 --> 00:05:38,354
At first, I felt the pressure.

56
00:05:38,354 --> 00:05:43,754
But I've always wanted to appear on this
channel.

57
00:05:43,754 --> 00:05:46,914
I was looking forward to it.

58
00:05:46,914 --> 00:05:49,154
How was it to enter the competition?

59
00:05:49,154 --> 00:05:54,434
I wasn't nervous that day.

60
00:05:54,434 --> 00:06:06,394
I was happy that I could go to a place
where the fans could finally listen to
my song.

61
00:06:06,394 --> 00:06:13,594
I was very happy when I imagined the
faces of the listeners.

62
00:06:13,594 --> 00:06:18,154
I was excited all day.

63
00:06:18,154 --> 00:06:22,754
It's been a long time since I've been
nervous.

64
00:06:22,754 --> 00:06:26,794
I wanted to experience that moment.

65
00:06:26,794 --> 00:06:30,834
I was happy to experience that moment.

66
00:06:30,834 --> 00:06:36,274
I was excited and nervous.

67
00:06:36,274 --> 00:06:38,274
What was the most memorable moment?

68
00:06:38,274 --> 00:06:42,754
The first word we said when we were six.

69
00:06:42,754 --> 00:06:45,674
It was the word PRIDE.

70
00:06:45,674 --> 00:06:49,074
PRIDE is a word that fits very well.

71
00:06:49,074 --> 00:06:55,834
We were very proud of ourselves.

72
00:06:55,834 --> 00:06:59,794
We were very confident about ourselves.

73
00:06:59,794 --> 00:07:03,794
We were able to show our strength.

74
00:07:03,794 --> 00:07:10,074
We were very popular.

75
00:07:10,074 --> 00:07:12,194
What is the most memorable moment?

76
00:07:12,194 --> 00:07:19,354
I saw the trend on SNS.

77
00:07:19,354 --> 00:07:30,234
I saw the name of the channel and the
words on my finger.

78
00:07:30,234 --> 00:07:35,034
I was very impressed.

79
00:07:35,034 --> 00:07:39,754
I still feel strange.

80
00:07:39,754 --> 00:07:43,074
But for me anyway...

81
00:07:43,074 --> 00:07:55,234
I was the happiest when I received the
message from the fans who believed in me
and waited for me.

82
00:07:55,234 --> 00:07:57,514
I was hoping for that.

83
00:07:57,514 --> 00:08:07,354
I think that's how I was able to spread
the message to the fans.

84
00:08:07,354 --> 00:08:16,594
The fans worked hard to spread the
message we sang.

85
00:08:16,594 --> 00:08:21,994
They were happy to be able to appear in
the same video as me.

86
00:08:21,994 --> 00:08:30,474
I felt that we had a long bond with the
fans.

87
00:08:30,474 --> 00:08:34,514
I was happy to be friends with the fans.

88
00:08:34,514 --> 00:08:36,634
What was the most important thing to
you?

89
00:08:36,634 --> 00:08:42,074
I was able to meet the three of them and
have a lesson with them.

90
00:08:42,074 --> 00:08:49,314
I was also able to receive a lot of
encouragement and energy.

91
00:08:49,314 --> 00:08:57,754
I think it's a good time for me to level
up.

92
00:08:57,754 --> 00:09:04,594
I'm looking forward to seeing how the
three of them will change.

93
00:09:04,594 --> 00:09:06,594
What do you want to do in the future?

94
00:09:06,594 --> 00:09:11,754
I want to appear in the video as soon as
possible.

95
00:09:11,754 --> 00:09:16,994
I think the explosive power of the live
performance will be amazing.

96
00:09:16,994 --> 00:09:23,394
I realized that I really like singing
while I was on the flight.

97
00:09:23,394 --> 00:09:30,074
I'm looking forward to singing in front
of the fans.

98
00:09:30,074 --> 00:09:37,074
I haven't tasted the air for more than
half a year.

99
00:09:37,074 --> 00:09:40,714
I want to feel it soon.

100
00:09:40,714 --> 00:09:44,594
What are you doing to take care of your
throat?

101
00:09:44,594 --> 00:09:48,554
I've been taking care of my throat since
the day before yesterday.

102
00:09:48,554 --> 00:09:52,154
I'm trying to take care of my throat.

103
00:09:52,154 --> 00:09:57,674
I've been using all the items I need to
take care of my throat.

104
00:09:57,674 --> 00:10:04,074
I was nervous in the morning.

105
00:10:04,074 --> 00:10:05,354
I was excited.

106
00:10:05,354 --> 00:10:13,314
I'm trying to take care of my throat.

107
00:10:13,314 --> 00:10:17,154
I tried to add more to the first take

108
00:10:17,154 --> 00:10:21,214
I think I was doing one by one

109
00:10:21,214 --> 00:10:23,314
What was the most nervous thing about
the first take?

110
00:10:23,314 --> 00:10:27,514
That was the most nervous thing

111
00:10:27,514 --> 00:10:32,554
I was really surprised when I was told
that the first take would come out

112
00:10:32,554 --> 00:10:37,334
I hope that everyone will always be one
of the top songs

113
00:10:37,334 --> 00:10:41,534
I hope that the song will be the Ebitune
song

114
00:10:41,534 --> 00:10:44,874
But it's the most wishful thinking, and
if I don't get into it

115
00:10:44,874 --> 00:10:48,414
I'm going to be on the first take

116
00:10:48,414 --> 00:10:55,854
I think that's what made me a little
nervous

117
00:10:55,854 --> 00:10:57,794
What was the most impressive thing about
the first take?

118
00:10:57,794 --> 00:11:00,694
I was so moved

119
00:11:00,694 --> 00:11:06,394
I read each comment one by one

120
00:11:06,394 --> 00:11:12,674
I'm really happy that I'm getting more
and more comments every time I open it

121
00:11:12,674 --> 00:11:17,474
It's all warm words

122
00:11:17,474 --> 00:11:24,754
I don't know the face of the person who
hit me

123
00:11:24,754 --> 00:11:31,754
There are so many warm messages that you
can hear

124
00:11:31,754 --> 00:11:38,394
It's not just about cheering, it's
really a member of the group in the
Ebitune

125
00:11:38,394 --> 00:11:45,594
I feel that you are supporting us again

126
00:11:45,594 --> 00:11:47,674
What was the most impressive thing about
the first take?

127
00:11:47,674 --> 00:11:55,634
I was a member of Ayaka before the first
take

128
00:11:55,634 --> 00:12:01,314
Ayaka has gotten better and I was
concerned

129
00:12:01,314 --> 00:12:11,954
I was meeting Ayaka, but I was able to
perform with six people, including
Ayaka, in front of various people

130
00:12:11,954 --> 00:12:14,354
It's been a long time since I've done it

131
00:12:14,354 --> 00:12:21,134
Ayaka fought against this disease

132
00:12:21,134 --> 00:12:27,634
I'm so happy that I can recover so
quickly

133
00:12:27,634 --> 00:12:38,514
The first take is the song we believe in

134
00:12:38,514 --> 00:12:44,034
These six will send the most hearts with
content

135
00:12:44,034 --> 00:12:52,354
I'm so grateful that I can deliver that
Ayaka has revived.

136
00:12:52,354 --> 00:13:04,114
I've been doing this with this member
for a long time, so I'm sure we'll
follow each other when we have
something.

137
00:13:04,114 --> 00:13:22,354
I think these six are the best friends
in my life. I think I'm living with
people who think those words are really
appropriate.

138
00:13:22,354 --> 00:13:29,634
I really love this member. I've overcome
various trials.

139
00:13:29,634 --> 00:13:37,074
I've been with six people, and I've been
happy and happy.

140
00:13:37,074 --> 00:13:45,234
I've been hoping for this moment for a
long time.

141
00:13:45,234 --> 00:13:51,714
I was able to accept that we had made a
mistake.

142
00:13:51,714 --> 00:13:54,914
That's what I'm most happy about.

143
00:13:54,914 --> 00:13:58,274
What is the most important thing about
Ayaka?

144
00:13:58,274 --> 00:14:06,674
We're going to make a new member do what
we should do.

145
00:14:06,674 --> 00:14:13,874
We're going to make a new member do what
we should do.

146
00:14:13,874 --> 00:14:18,434
I think that's how we'll be born.

147
00:14:18,434 --> 00:14:33,954
We're a group that can show each of our
nine colors. We're going to make sure
that we don't ruin the image of the new
members.

148
00:14:33,954 --> 00:14:40,674
I hope we can see the new members live
and say,

149
00:14:40,674 --> 00:14:49,474
That's the best thing about Ayaka. I
hope we can continue to be that kind of
group.

150
00:14:49,474 --> 00:14:53,954
I'm going to make a live show that makes
you think,

151
00:14:53,954 --> 00:14:57,634
I've been out for a year, but I'm sure
this is it.

152
00:14:57,634 --> 00:15:01,954
We have two days, so I want to make sure
everyone is in good health.

153
00:15:01,954 --> 00:15:05,154
I want to make a live show that makes
everyone say,

154
00:15:05,154 --> 00:15:08,354
I had a lot of fun with a smile until
the end.

155
00:15:08,354 --> 00:15:13,154
Thank you for watching.
