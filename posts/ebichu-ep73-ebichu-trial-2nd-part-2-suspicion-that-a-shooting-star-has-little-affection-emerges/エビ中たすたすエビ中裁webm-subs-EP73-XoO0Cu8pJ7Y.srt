00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
This week's Ebichu Tastas continues from
last week.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:08,000
Ebichu Tastas trial part 2

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:09,000
Are you sleepy?

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:10,000
Yes

5
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:13,000
You are a user

6
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:19,000
Who will be judged tonight?

7
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Ebichu Tastas start

8
00:00:30,746 --> 00:00:34,746
100 times more exciting emotions

9
00:00:34,746 --> 00:00:35,746
TORO!

10
00:00:35,746 --> 00:00:39,746
I'm so into you that I can't stand it

11
00:00:39,746 --> 00:00:44,746
What should I do with the heart of the
jubilee?

12
00:00:44,746 --> 00:00:49,746
Moratorium, Moratorium, Moratorium,
middle school student

13
00:00:49,746 --> 00:00:54,746
Add various things to your private Ebisu
middle school

14
00:00:54,746 --> 00:00:59,746
Ebichu Tastas

15
00:01:01,306 --> 00:01:06,306
This program is brought to you by the
following sponsors.

16
00:01:15,418 --> 00:01:22,598
Tonight, Castasves'救再犯 gets decided by a
cast of members.

17
00:01:23,072 --> 00:01:28,472
In this trial, Kenji is the prosecutor,
and Kaiki is the lawyer.

18
00:01:28,472 --> 00:01:32,992
The members will decide whether they are
guilty or not.

19
00:01:32,992 --> 00:01:36,792
The judge will give the verdict.

20
00:01:37,992 --> 00:01:41,152
Today, Hirota and Nakayama will be
judged.

21
00:01:41,152 --> 00:01:45,992
And the fate of that person?

22
00:01:45,992 --> 00:01:50,072
Now, let's begin the trial!

23
00:01:50,072 --> 00:01:55,072
The next case is this one.

24
00:01:55,072 --> 00:01:59,072
The cute one is too low.

25
00:01:59,072 --> 00:02:01,072
What is that?

26
00:02:01,072 --> 00:02:04,072
The defendant, Hirota Aikawa, is the
judge.

27
00:02:04,072 --> 00:02:07,920
What is that?

28
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:09,920
I don't know what it is.

29
00:02:09,920 --> 00:02:13,056
Cute? The hurdle is too low.

30
00:02:13,056 --> 00:02:15,056
Hirota's suspicion.

31
00:02:15,056 --> 00:02:19,056
The hurdle of being cute is too low.

32
00:02:19,056 --> 00:02:21,056
The defendant, Hirota Aikawa,

33
00:02:21,056 --> 00:02:25,056
has a tendency to say that everything
she sees is cute.

34
00:02:25,056 --> 00:02:30,056
Of course, if she really thinks so, it's
not a bad thing.

35
00:02:30,056 --> 00:02:25,436
But there are many cases where she can't
say that it's a

36
00:02:25,436 --> 00:02:30,056
It's not a bad thing if she really
thinks so.

37
00:02:30,056 --> 00:02:31,056
But there are many cases where she can't
say that it's a

38
00:02:31,056 --> 00:02:34,056
It's not a bad thing if she really
thinks so.

39
00:02:34,056 --> 00:02:38,056
So, she's going to base it on the hurdle
of being cute being too low.

40
00:02:38,056 --> 00:02:40,352
Oh!

41
00:02:40,352 --> 00:02:42,352
That's amazing!

42
00:02:42,352 --> 00:02:46,352
You've been saying that Chuu-Ei's face
is cute.

43
00:02:46,352 --> 00:02:49,352
That's all I can say at this point.

44
00:02:49,352 --> 00:02:51,352
I'm not cute.

45
00:02:51,352 --> 00:02:53,352
You're cute!

46
00:02:53,352 --> 00:02:55,352
You're cute!

47
00:02:55,352 --> 00:02:57,352
I feel bad.

48
00:02:57,352 --> 00:03:02,352
So, here's the proof of VTR.

49
00:03:02,352 --> 00:03:04,352
Please watch.

50
00:03:04,352 --> 00:03:07,352
How low is the hurdle of being cute?

51
00:03:07,352 --> 00:03:10,352
Here's the proof.

52
00:03:15,930 --> 00:03:16,930
Touch it.

53
00:03:16,930 --> 00:03:17,930
Okay.

54
00:03:19,930 --> 00:03:20,930
It's cute!

55
00:03:20,930 --> 00:03:22,930
It's not cute.

56
00:03:23,930 --> 00:03:24,930
It's not cute.

57
00:03:28,930 --> 00:03:31,930
There was a question mark.

58
00:03:31,930 --> 00:03:33,930
It's cute.

59
00:03:34,930 --> 00:03:35,930
It's cute.

60
00:03:36,930 --> 00:03:37,930
It's cute.

61
00:03:37,930 --> 00:03:42,528
It's cute.

62
00:03:42,528 --> 00:03:44,528
I'm counting.

63
00:03:44,528 --> 00:03:49,528
I'll be watching the game.

64
00:03:49,528 --> 00:03:53,528
You say it's cute no matter what.

65
00:03:53,528 --> 00:03:56,528
The standard of cuteness is strange.

66
00:03:56,528 --> 00:04:00,528
I want to check the standard of
cuteness.

67
00:04:00,528 --> 00:04:02,528
Let's evaluate.

68
00:04:02,528 --> 00:04:05,528
Hirota says it's cute no matter what.

69
00:04:05,528 --> 00:04:08,528
Where is her standard of cuteness?

70
00:04:08,528 --> 00:04:12,096
Let's verify it.

71
00:04:12,096 --> 00:04:14,096
Let's start with the first one.

72
00:04:14,096 --> 00:04:17,440
Isn't this OK?

73
00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:19,040
Oh, it's a cucumber.

74
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:20,040
I like the color.

75
00:04:20,040 --> 00:04:21,040
This is cute.

76
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:22,040
This is cute?

77
00:04:22,040 --> 00:04:23,040
Wait a minute.

78
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:25,040
Which one is cute?

79
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:26,040
This is not cute.

80
00:04:26,040 --> 00:04:27,040
This is not cute.

81
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:28,040
This is cute.

82
00:04:28,040 --> 00:04:32,040
This is not cute because it's thick.

83
00:04:32,040 --> 00:04:34,040
All of these are better.

84
00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:37,040
I like this one.

85
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:39,040
I like the color.

86
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:41,040
This is cute.

87
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:42,040
This is cute.

88
00:04:42,040 --> 00:04:49,040
It looks like the same cucumber, but
Hirota thinks this one looks cute.

89
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:54,040
Can he get closer to the truth of the
cuteness that Hirota thinks?

90
00:04:54,040 --> 00:04:57,040
He will further examine the criteria.

91
00:04:57,040 --> 00:04:58,040
I will go.

92
00:05:00,040 --> 00:05:01,040
Is this a bonito?

93
00:05:01,040 --> 00:05:03,040
This is a canna.

94
00:05:03,040 --> 00:05:04,040
This is a canna.

95
00:05:04,040 --> 00:05:05,040
Is this a tree?

96
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:06,040
Yes.

97
00:05:06,040 --> 00:05:07,040
How is it?

98
00:05:07,040 --> 00:05:09,040
It may be different in cuteness, but I
want it normally.

99
00:05:09,040 --> 00:05:11,040
This is not cute.

100
00:05:11,040 --> 00:05:12,040
I see.

101
00:05:12,040 --> 00:05:15,040
Canna is not cute.

102
00:05:15,040 --> 00:05:17,040
This is a mass-produced type.

103
00:05:17,040 --> 00:05:18,040
Mass-produced type.

104
00:05:18,040 --> 00:05:19,040
I see.

105
00:05:19,040 --> 00:05:21,040
I want you to tell me the
characteristics.

106
00:05:21,040 --> 00:05:24,256
To be continued.

107
00:05:24,256 --> 00:05:25,256
Let's go.

108
00:05:27,256 --> 00:05:29,256
This is amazing.

109
00:05:29,256 --> 00:05:37,888
The three types of screws that Hirota
has in front of him are slightly
different in shape and size.

110
00:05:37,888 --> 00:05:38,888
There are many types.

111
00:05:38,888 --> 00:05:40,888
Cute, cute.

112
00:05:40,888 --> 00:05:41,888
Cute?

113
00:05:41,888 --> 00:05:42,888
Which one?

114
00:05:42,888 --> 00:05:43,888
Which one?

115
00:05:43,888 --> 00:05:44,888
I don't know.

116
00:05:44,888 --> 00:05:45,888
Which one is cute?

117
00:05:45,888 --> 00:05:49,888
The tools are mass-produced, but I like
it.

118
00:05:49,888 --> 00:05:51,888
There are many variations, so I like it.

119
00:05:51,888 --> 00:05:52,888
Which one is cute?

120
00:05:52,888 --> 00:05:57,888
Well, if I say it's cute, it's
definitely this one.

121
00:05:57,888 --> 00:05:58,888
Definitely this one.

122
00:05:58,888 --> 00:06:00,888
If you say it's cute, it's definitely
this one.

123
00:06:00,888 --> 00:06:01,888
Definitely this one.

124
00:06:01,888 --> 00:06:03,888
This is cute.

125
00:06:03,888 --> 00:06:05,888
This is cute, right?

126
00:06:05,888 --> 00:06:07,888
The blue one is cute.

127
00:06:07,888 --> 00:06:08,888
The blue one is cute, right?

128
00:06:08,888 --> 00:06:10,888
There's a blue one, right?

129
00:06:10,888 --> 00:06:13,888
If it's among these, it's like this in
terms of ranking.

130
00:06:13,888 --> 00:06:14,888
1, 2, 3.

131
00:06:14,888 --> 00:06:15,888
Yes.

132
00:06:15,888 --> 00:06:16,888
What's the cuteness?

133
00:06:16,888 --> 00:06:17,888
It's all cute.

134
00:06:17,888 --> 00:06:19,888
But if you say it's your favorite, it's
like this.

135
00:06:19,888 --> 00:06:20,888
It changes.

136
00:06:20,888 --> 00:06:21,888
If you say it's cute, it's cute.

137
00:06:21,888 --> 00:06:23,888
If you say it's cute, it's like this.

138
00:06:23,888 --> 00:06:24,888
This is the top.

139
00:06:24,888 --> 00:06:25,888
I see.

140
00:06:25,888 --> 00:06:28,888
That's all.

141
00:06:28,888 --> 00:06:36,888
To find out Hirota's cute standard, I
showed him various things, but the
mystery only deepened.

142
00:06:36,888 --> 00:06:43,616
So, I decided to ask him about his
particularity once again.

143
00:06:43,616 --> 00:06:51,116
I think it's strange that people who
have decided on this thing called
cuteness, not based on the criteria of
cuteness.

144
00:06:52,116 --> 00:07:01,116
I think that each person has their own
cuteness, and I don't think it's
something that should be said.

145
00:07:01,616 --> 00:07:02,616
Well done.

146
00:07:06,616 --> 00:07:08,616
Now, the verdict.

147
00:07:08,616 --> 00:07:12,976
Is Hirota's cuteness a crime or not?

148
00:07:12,976 --> 00:07:14,976
Here we go!

149
00:07:14,976 --> 00:07:15,976
Innocent! Innocent! Innocent!

150
00:07:15,976 --> 00:07:21,976
Innocent 7 votes, Innocent 0 votes, so
the defendant Hirota is innocent!

151
00:07:27,976 --> 00:07:35,976
In the end, the cute standard of Hirota
remains a mystery, but it seems that he
has a strong commitment, so as a result
of his innocence...

152
00:07:35,976 --> 00:07:41,976
Next, the second trial today

153
00:07:42,592 --> 00:07:49,592
Next, the third trial, the court of
Ebisu Junior High School

154
00:07:50,592 --> 00:07:52,592
Do you know this?

155
00:07:53,592 --> 00:07:55,592
The judge

156
00:07:55,592 --> 00:07:57,136
Next, the fourth trial, the court of
Ebisu Junior High School

157
00:07:57,136 --> 00:08:02,136
I will read the basic documents of the
case.

158
00:08:02,136 --> 00:08:04,136
What is this script?

159
00:08:04,136 --> 00:08:05,136
It's strange.

160
00:08:05,136 --> 00:08:07,136
What is this script?

161
00:08:07,136 --> 00:08:09,136
Anyone can read the basic documents,
right?

162
00:08:09,136 --> 00:08:11,136
I admit it.

163
00:08:11,136 --> 00:08:14,136
The two of you, the defendant and the
scriptwriter,

164
00:08:14,136 --> 00:08:18,136
have been doing the program with Ebichu
for many years,

165
00:08:18,136 --> 00:08:23,136
but you don't have any affection for
Ebichu.

166
00:08:23,136 --> 00:08:31,136
I think you only want a business-like
relationship.

167
00:08:31,136 --> 00:08:34,800
The Te Knowledge Show

168
00:08:34,800 --> 00:08:37,680
Robinson & Co presents

169
00:08:37,780 --> 00:08:40,100
Now it's time to execute personification

170
00:08:40,620 --> 00:08:42,000
on kinds of public school

171
00:08:42,420 --> 00:08:36,620
The

172
00:08:44,340 --> 00:08:45,140
Time of Juk Ryu

173
00:08:45,888 --> 00:08:47,888
No, no, no, no, this is strange

174
00:08:48,888 --> 00:08:51,888
A sudden shock of suspicion

175
00:08:52,888 --> 00:08:56,888
From here, Hirota will be the judge, and
Ogata will be the prosecutor

176
00:08:56,888 --> 00:08:59,888
To pursue the crime of shooting stars

177
00:09:00,888 --> 00:09:03,888
The other day, there was a tour final in
Ebichu

178
00:09:04,888 --> 00:09:07,888
I also stood on the same stage

179
00:09:07,888 --> 00:09:12,888
But the two of them couldn't come to the
venue

180
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:17,200
They couldn't come.

181
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:19,200
It's their job.

182
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:21,200
It can't be helped.

183
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:26,200
The last day of the Ebitu HALT TOUR,
where O-gata Kaiki also participated.

184
00:09:26,200 --> 00:09:38,768
The shooting star who was working in
Kansai on the same day couldn't come to
the cheering.

185
00:09:38,768 --> 00:09:43,768
In the midst of that, you two sent
flowers to the venue.

186
00:09:43,768 --> 00:09:45,768
Yes, we couldn't go.

187
00:09:45,768 --> 00:09:47,768
We sent flowers.

188
00:09:47,768 --> 00:09:49,768
I also saw the flowers.

189
00:09:50,768 --> 00:09:55,048
However, the flowers are the evidence to
support the

190
00:09:55,048 --> 00:09:56,768
thin-willed suspicion.

191
00:09:56,768 --> 00:09:59,768
What is the meaning of this?

192
00:09:59,768 --> 00:10:04,768
When the shooting star actually checked
the flowers he sent to the Ebi-cho,

193
00:10:04,768 --> 00:10:07,768
Look, there are nice flowers, cute
flowers.

194
00:10:07,768 --> 00:10:09,768
They are totally nice.

195
00:10:09,768 --> 00:10:10,768
Look.

196
00:10:10,768 --> 00:10:12,768
What?

197
00:10:12,768 --> 00:10:14,768
What?

198
00:10:14,768 --> 00:10:16,282
What?

199
00:10:16,282 --> 00:10:19,282
Look at this!

200
00:10:19,282 --> 00:10:20,282
What?

201
00:10:20,282 --> 00:10:23,282
Shiritu Ebisu Junior High School?

202
00:10:23,282 --> 00:10:26,282
What? Where is that group?

203
00:10:26,282 --> 00:10:29,282
It's not there!

204
00:10:29,282 --> 00:10:31,282
But this is really...

205
00:10:31,282 --> 00:10:32,282
When you send flowers,

206
00:10:32,282 --> 00:10:33,282
I'm serious.

207
00:10:33,282 --> 00:10:36,282
The person who sends flowers is the
wrong person.

208
00:10:36,282 --> 00:10:39,282
We said Shiritu Ebisu Junior High
School.

209
00:10:39,282 --> 00:10:40,282
Hey!

210
00:10:40,282 --> 00:10:41,282
Look!

211
00:10:41,282 --> 00:10:44,282
Do you blame Manegi-san?

212
00:10:44,282 --> 00:10:46,282
Please tell him this.

213
00:10:46,282 --> 00:10:48,282
I can't go to Ebichu's live show.

214
00:10:48,282 --> 00:10:51,282
I have to send flowers.

215
00:10:51,282 --> 00:10:52,282
Then I said, okay.

216
00:10:52,282 --> 00:10:54,282
Chuei said, I'll tell you.

217
00:10:54,282 --> 00:10:57,282
You're dirty!

218
00:10:57,282 --> 00:10:58,282
That's right.

219
00:10:58,282 --> 00:11:00,282
You're dirty!

220
00:11:00,282 --> 00:11:03,282
Maybe this guy is in Ebisu Junior High
School.

221
00:11:03,282 --> 00:11:05,282
I said Shiritu Ebisu Junior High School.

222
00:11:05,282 --> 00:11:07,282
If this guy says that,

223
00:11:07,282 --> 00:11:11,282
I didn't make it after it was over.

224
00:11:11,282 --> 00:11:14,282
You said that, didn't you?

225
00:11:14,282 --> 00:11:15,282
That's right.

226
00:11:15,282 --> 00:11:16,282
That's right.

227
00:11:16,282 --> 00:11:19,282
Chuei didn't make it to the live show.

228
00:11:19,282 --> 00:11:22,282
He was rushing to the venue in Tokyo
from Hyogo

229
00:11:22,282 --> 00:11:25,282
just to make up for the members.

230
00:11:25,282 --> 00:11:26,282
Good job!

231
00:11:26,282 --> 00:11:28,698
Good job!

232
00:11:28,698 --> 00:11:30,698
But I want to say this.

233
00:11:30,698 --> 00:11:32,698
You really didn't make it.

234
00:11:32,698 --> 00:11:34,698
I'll tell you the truth.

235
00:11:34,698 --> 00:11:41,232
I wanted to eat Akashi-yaki, so I took a
train.

236
00:11:41,232 --> 00:11:48,232
I can eat shrimp, but I can't eat
Akashi-yaki.

237
00:11:48,232 --> 00:11:53,232
I can't go to Kansai.

238
00:11:53,232 --> 00:11:59,232
I found a more shocking photo.

239
00:11:59,232 --> 00:12:02,232
Can you see it?

240
00:12:02,232 --> 00:12:05,232
What is this?

241
00:12:05,232 --> 00:12:08,232
This is...

242
00:12:08,232 --> 00:12:14,232
After the concert, I drank with Ogata
and Hiya.

243
00:12:14,232 --> 00:12:16,232
Why?

244
00:12:16,232 --> 00:12:23,232
Why didn't you come to the party with
me?

245
00:12:23,232 --> 00:12:26,232
It's not the time to call me.

246
00:12:26,232 --> 00:12:31,546
I'm angry.

247
00:12:31,546 --> 00:12:33,546
You're angry!

248
00:12:33,546 --> 00:12:35,546
You're angry!

249
00:12:35,546 --> 00:12:37,546
I don't have any excuses.

250
00:12:37,546 --> 00:12:41,546
Please give the defendant the final
sentence.

251
00:12:41,546 --> 00:12:43,546
Did you see that?

252
00:12:45,546 --> 00:12:53,546
So, the final sentence of the defendant
who has never felt love for shrimp.

253
00:12:53,546 --> 00:12:57,312
I really have love.

254
00:12:57,312 --> 00:13:00,312
I will go to your concert.

255
00:13:00,312 --> 00:13:03,312
I will do it.

256
00:13:04,312 --> 00:13:07,312
I will go to your concert.

257
00:13:07,312 --> 00:13:09,312
That's all.

258
00:13:10,312 --> 00:13:11,312
The verdict.

259
00:13:11,312 --> 00:13:16,312
Is the action against the shrimp in the
pot guilty or not?

260
00:13:16,312 --> 00:13:21,312
Everyone, please raise your hand.

261
00:13:21,312 --> 00:13:23,312
I believe in myself.

262
00:13:23,312 --> 00:13:25,808
The verdict is...

263
00:13:25,808 --> 00:13:27,808
・・・I'm sorry.

264
00:13:27,808 --> 00:13:28,808
Hey!

265
00:13:28,808 --> 00:13:30,808
What are you talking about?

266
00:13:30,808 --> 00:13:36,808
自分、彼国的な信仰を、エビチュー愛を証明するため、

267
00:13:36,808 --> 00:13:41,808
一個月以内にエビチューの歌とダンスを完璧に覚えてくれたいもの。

268
00:13:41,808 --> 00:13:43,808
マジで?

269
00:13:43,808 --> 00:13:46,016
Thank you very much.

270
00:13:46,016 --> 00:13:55,016
The song is called 春休みモラトリアの違う。 何で? マジで?

271
00:13:55,016 --> 00:13:58,016
Thank you very much.

272
00:14:02,016 --> 00:14:06,016
It's been a month and it's been a lot.

273
00:14:06,016 --> 00:14:09,808
Really?

274
00:14:09,808 --> 00:14:14,808
After this, Nakayama will be judged for
that crime

275
00:14:14,808 --> 00:14:16,808
But before that...

276
00:14:19,808 --> 00:14:22,808
Ebi-Chuu, the narrow path to becoming a
lyricist

277
00:14:23,808 --> 00:14:26,808
This project is a project where Ebi-Chuu
challenges lyrics

278
00:14:26,808 --> 00:14:32,400
To be used in a new song

279
00:14:32,400 --> 00:14:36,900
Tonight, we have a big development
related to the future of the project

280
00:14:36,900 --> 00:14:38,400
What is it?

281
00:14:38,400 --> 00:14:41,400
This time, what we are going to do is

282
00:14:41,400 --> 00:14:43,400
We want to write lyrics

283
00:14:43,400 --> 00:14:46,400
But the theme of the lyrics has not been
decided yet

284
00:14:46,400 --> 00:14:47,400
It is a big premise

285
00:14:47,400 --> 00:14:50,400
What is the theme of the song?

286
00:14:51,400 --> 00:14:56,400
Up to now, we have learned about writing
lyrics in various ways

287
00:14:56,400 --> 00:15:02,400
The final goal of this project is to be
adopted as a song during the debut

288
00:15:04,570 --> 00:15:12,570
So first of all, let's think about the
theme of the song that the members will
write.

289
00:15:13,570 --> 00:15:15,570
The theme is important.

290
00:15:15,570 --> 00:15:20,570
If it goes well, we can add the song and
make it a proper song.

291
00:15:20,570 --> 00:15:22,570
Please think seriously.

292
00:15:24,570 --> 00:15:28,570
So, let's announce the theme that each
member wants to write.

293
00:15:28,570 --> 00:15:32,570
First, from Mayama.

294
00:15:32,848 --> 00:15:34,848
Yes, Hikari.

295
00:15:34,848 --> 00:15:36,848
What does this mean?

296
00:15:36,848 --> 00:15:40,848
Hikari is always in our lives, right?

297
00:15:40,848 --> 00:15:41,848
Yes.

298
00:15:41,848 --> 00:15:45,848
So, simply, if it's us, we can be
thankful to Shoumei-san.

299
00:15:45,848 --> 00:15:48,848
During the live...

300
00:15:48,848 --> 00:15:51,848
Wait, thankful to Shoumei-san?

301
00:15:51,848 --> 00:15:55,848
Or, we can be thankful to CYRIUM during
the live.

302
00:15:55,848 --> 00:15:59,848
If it's like, you are my Hikari, we can
do that.

303
00:15:59,848 --> 00:16:02,848
We can do that.

304
00:16:02,848 --> 00:16:04,848
We connected it forcibly.

305
00:16:04,848 --> 00:16:06,976
This is Nakayama.

306
00:16:06,976 --> 00:16:08,976
I was like, is this the meaning of it?

307
00:16:09,976 --> 00:16:11,976
It's like a talk theme.

308
00:16:11,976 --> 00:16:13,976
What does it mean?

309
00:16:13,976 --> 00:16:18,976
I don't really understand the song, but
at the end, I made her think, oh!

310
00:16:18,976 --> 00:16:22,976
You made her think, what is she singing?

311
00:16:22,976 --> 00:16:23,976
I see.

312
00:16:23,976 --> 00:16:26,976
So, the listener is wondering what she
is singing.

313
00:16:26,976 --> 00:16:28,976
So, it's about 3 minutes.

314
00:16:28,976 --> 00:16:32,816
Next is Yasumoto.

315
00:16:32,816 --> 00:16:33,816
The gap.

316
00:16:34,816 --> 00:16:36,816
The gap? What do you mean?

317
00:16:36,816 --> 00:16:41,816
For example, if you are in the middle of
the movie, you are between an adult and
a child.

318
00:16:41,816 --> 00:16:43,816
In this age, you are a high school
student.

319
00:16:43,816 --> 00:16:49,816
Or if your home is between Yoyogi Uehara
and Yoyogi Park,

320
00:16:49,816 --> 00:16:54,816
you may be wondering which station is
the nearest.

321
00:16:54,816 --> 00:16:55,816
There are some stations.

322
00:16:55,816 --> 00:17:00,816
I think there are many people who are
wondering which station to use.

323
00:17:00,816 --> 00:17:02,816
I just got a second one.

324
00:17:02,816 --> 00:17:03,816
I thought of Paton.

325
00:17:03,816 --> 00:17:05,816
Paton is not living in the movie.

326
00:17:05,816 --> 00:17:08,816
So, if you are in the middle of the
movie, you are between Yoyogi Park and
Yoyogi Park.

327
00:17:08,816 --> 00:17:11,816
You may be wondering which station to
use.

328
00:17:11,816 --> 00:17:14,816
Wait a minute. Why did you go to my
house?

329
00:17:14,816 --> 00:17:16,816
I was about to cry.

330
00:17:16,816 --> 00:17:20,272
Next is Matsuno.

331
00:17:20,272 --> 00:17:22,272
Everyone's favorite food song.

332
00:17:23,272 --> 00:17:25,272
You're going to buy food, right?

333
00:17:25,272 --> 00:17:27,272
If it's me, Young Con.

334
00:17:28,272 --> 00:17:29,272
It's a bit difficult.

335
00:17:29,272 --> 00:17:34,272
I'm just going to say what I like to
eat.

336
00:17:34,272 --> 00:17:40,272
For example, if you had a favorite food
that pops up in your head, what would
you choose?

337
00:17:40,272 --> 00:17:41,272
Ramen.

338
00:17:41,272 --> 00:17:44,272
Ramen, ramen, ramen.

339
00:17:44,272 --> 00:17:46,272
And Yasumoto?

340
00:17:46,272 --> 00:17:47,272
Tomato.

341
00:17:47,272 --> 00:17:49,272
Ramen, ramen, ramen.

342
00:17:49,272 --> 00:17:52,272
Mixing various things and making it into
one rhythm.

343
00:17:52,272 --> 00:17:53,272
I want to try it.

344
00:17:53,272 --> 00:17:54,272
Let's try it.

345
00:17:55,272 --> 00:18:01,272
So, if you all choose your favorite
food, will it be like a song?

346
00:18:01,272 --> 00:18:03,272
Matsuno will do it.

347
00:18:03,272 --> 00:18:04,272
Let's all do it together.

348
00:18:04,272 --> 00:18:06,272
1, 2, 3, 4.

349
00:18:06,272 --> 00:18:09,272
Young Con, Young Con, Young Con.

350
00:18:09,272 --> 00:18:11,272
It's a very unique melody.

351
00:18:11,272 --> 00:18:13,272
Young Con, Young Con, Young Con.

352
00:18:13,272 --> 00:18:14,272
Let's do it.

353
00:18:14,272 --> 00:18:16,272
Young Con, Young Con, Young Con.

354
00:18:16,272 --> 00:18:17,272
It's good.

355
00:18:17,272 --> 00:18:20,272
Ramen, ramen, ramen.

356
00:18:20,272 --> 00:18:22,272
Mixing various things and making it into
one rhythm.

357
00:18:22,272 --> 00:18:24,272
What are you saying?

358
00:18:24,272 --> 00:18:25,272
What?

359
00:18:25,272 --> 00:18:27,272
It's a different song.

360
00:18:27,272 --> 00:18:28,272
That's what I'm saying.

361
00:18:28,272 --> 00:18:30,272
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

362
00:18:30,272 --> 00:18:31,272
It's good.

363
00:18:31,272 --> 00:18:32,272
Thank you, thank you.

364
00:18:32,272 --> 00:18:33,272
Thank you.

365
00:18:33,272 --> 00:18:35,272
It's a very unique melody.

366
00:18:35,272 --> 00:18:37,272
It's really good.

367
00:18:37,272 --> 00:18:38,272
How did you say it?

368
00:18:38,272 --> 00:18:40,272
Let's start with Matsuno.

369
00:18:40,272 --> 00:18:42,272
Young, Young Con, Con.

370
00:18:42,272 --> 00:18:43,272
No, no.

371
00:18:43,272 --> 00:18:48,272
Young Con, Young Con, Young Con.

372
00:18:48,304 --> 00:18:51,304
Please don't make a different version.

373
00:18:52,304 --> 00:18:56,304
They are supposed to decide the theme of
the lyrics, but they are just having a
discussion.

374
00:18:56,304 --> 00:18:59,304
Will they be able to decide the theme
like this?

375
00:18:59,304 --> 00:19:01,304
Let's continue to the next episode.

376
00:19:02,304 --> 00:19:06,304
After this, finally, it's time for the
trial of Nakayama.

377
00:19:06,304 --> 00:19:08,304
I'm the one who's not good at this.

378
00:19:08,304 --> 00:19:14,490
The quickly feverish

379
00:19:14,490 --> 00:19:17,490
The next basic case is this one.

380
00:19:18,490 --> 00:19:21,490
The moment when an adult suddenly
responds.

381
00:19:22,490 --> 00:19:23,490
I think I know.

382
00:19:23,490 --> 00:19:24,490
That girl?

383
00:19:24,490 --> 00:19:26,490
It was that girl.

384
00:19:26,490 --> 00:19:35,130
The defendant, Mariko Nakayama, is in
the front.

385
00:19:35,130 --> 00:19:37,130
Are you sleepy?

386
00:19:37,130 --> 00:19:38,130
Yes.

387
00:19:40,130 --> 00:19:42,130
You are a hero.

388
00:19:42,130 --> 00:19:45,130
The suspicion that Nakayama made.

389
00:19:45,130 --> 00:19:48,130
The moment when she suddenly responded
to adult.

390
00:19:48,130 --> 00:19:51,130
According to the member's report,

391
00:19:51,130 --> 00:19:56,130
Riko Nakayama, the defendant, has
recently become an adult.

392
00:19:56,130 --> 00:19:59,130
There are things that people can't
follow.

393
00:19:59,130 --> 00:20:03,130
So she suddenly responds to adult too
much.

394
00:20:03,130 --> 00:20:05,130
What?

395
00:20:05,296 --> 00:20:06,296
Adult?

396
00:20:06,296 --> 00:20:09,296
There is also a proof video.

397
00:20:09,296 --> 00:20:13,296
Please see the moment when you suddenly
become an adult.

398
00:20:14,296 --> 00:20:18,296
Nakayama was asked where she wanted to
go abroad.

399
00:20:18,296 --> 00:20:20,296
Aurora.

400
00:20:20,296 --> 00:20:22,296
I want to see the aurora.

401
00:20:22,296 --> 00:20:23,296
It's written.

402
00:20:23,296 --> 00:20:25,296
Did you say something every time?

403
00:20:25,296 --> 00:20:29,296
I said a lot before, but I don't think
it will come true.

404
00:20:29,296 --> 00:20:31,296
You still give up.

405
00:20:31,296 --> 00:20:35,296
You suddenly give up.

406
00:20:35,296 --> 00:20:37,296
Don't make me sad.

407
00:20:37,296 --> 00:20:39,296
You still have a chance.

408
00:20:39,296 --> 00:20:40,296
I will not give up.

409
00:20:40,296 --> 00:20:46,224
Nakayama asked if she liked the stars.

410
00:20:46,224 --> 00:20:48,224
Nakayama is doing her best.

411
00:20:48,224 --> 00:20:49,224
You like the stars?

412
00:20:49,224 --> 00:20:50,224
Yes.

413
00:20:50,224 --> 00:20:51,224
Everyone likes the stars.

414
00:20:51,224 --> 00:20:53,224
I don't know much about them.

415
00:20:53,224 --> 00:20:55,224
You're suddenly talking about them.

416
00:20:55,224 --> 00:20:57,224
Nakayama has become an adult.

417
00:20:57,224 --> 00:20:59,472
They kind of passionately talk about her

418
00:20:59,472 --> 00:21:02,072
Yes, that's right. Did you understand?

419
00:21:02,072 --> 00:21:03,072
I understood.

420
00:21:03,072 --> 00:21:07,072
Right? If you suddenly think that you
are the one who is eating, you suddenly
talk about it.

421
00:21:07,072 --> 00:21:08,072
In an adult's way.

422
00:21:08,072 --> 00:21:09,072
Yes.

423
00:21:09,072 --> 00:21:12,072
Yes, yes, yes. It's like, suddenly it's
realistic.

424
00:21:12,072 --> 00:21:14,472
It's a little bit exciting for us.

425
00:21:14,472 --> 00:21:16,272
How about you?

426
00:21:16,272 --> 00:21:19,072
Do you have any real feelings?

427
00:21:19,072 --> 00:21:22,688
I don't know anything. I really don't
know anything.

428
00:21:22,688 --> 00:21:24,688
I'm not sure.

429
00:21:24,688 --> 00:21:30,688
But I'm still doing it because I feel
like it.

430
00:21:31,688 --> 00:21:39,688
Nakayama claims that it is not the cold
that suddenly responds to adult.

431
00:21:40,688 --> 00:21:44,688
By the way, how many people do you think
Nakayama is a mood maker?

432
00:21:44,688 --> 00:21:47,200
I don't know.

433
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:50,200
ーShe is doing it by herself. ーYes.

434
00:21:50,200 --> 00:21:53,200
ーDo you have any specific story? ー

435
00:21:53,200 --> 00:21:55,200
ーLike, you don't feel good. ー

436
00:21:55,200 --> 00:21:58,200
ーBut, I think... ー

437
00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:04,200
ーYasumoto's testimony is going to change
the whole story. ー

438
00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:09,200
ーI'm not happy when I'm being eaten by
someone. ー

439
00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:11,200
ーWhat? ー

440
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:14,704
ーI'm sorry. ー

441
00:22:14,704 --> 00:22:17,704
I think it's a burning point.

442
00:22:17,704 --> 00:22:20,704
When you suddenly show off your
tsundere.

443
00:22:20,704 --> 00:22:22,704
I think it's popular.

444
00:22:22,704 --> 00:22:26,704
Do you feel lonely when you're pushed
around?

445
00:22:26,704 --> 00:22:31,704
I do, but I don't feel the joy when I
come.

446
00:22:32,704 --> 00:22:34,704
You feel twice as happy.

447
00:22:34,704 --> 00:22:37,704
I feel twice as happy.

448
00:22:37,704 --> 00:22:39,704
What do you feel?

449
00:22:39,704 --> 00:22:44,704
I don't know. I don't know.

450
00:22:44,704 --> 00:22:46,704
I see.

451
00:22:46,704 --> 00:22:48,704
I didn't know that.

452
00:22:48,704 --> 00:22:50,704
I was troubled by N-1.

453
00:22:50,704 --> 00:22:58,192
Yasumoto says that when Nakayama is
down, it's a burning point.

454
00:22:58,192 --> 00:23:04,192
So, we'll give him a cucumber of his
favorite food and see if he can burn it.

455
00:23:08,832 --> 00:23:13,832
I like it with vinegar.

456
00:23:13,832 --> 00:23:15,832
No!

457
00:23:15,832 --> 00:23:20,832
It's not cucumber, it's vinegar.

458
00:23:20,832 --> 00:23:23,832
This animal is difficult.

459
00:23:23,832 --> 00:23:26,832
I heard it was a herb.

460
00:23:26,832 --> 00:23:28,832
I heard it was a herb.

461
00:23:28,832 --> 00:23:30,832
What do you think?

462
00:23:30,832 --> 00:23:32,832
Can I say this?

463
00:23:32,832 --> 00:23:33,832
Please, lawyer.

464
00:23:33,832 --> 00:23:36,832
She is very particular.

465
00:23:36,832 --> 00:23:39,832
It's a human being.

466
00:23:40,048 --> 00:23:42,048
I said it.

467
00:23:42,048 --> 00:23:44,048
I said it.

468
00:23:46,048 --> 00:23:48,048
I wanted to do it suddenly.

469
00:23:50,048 --> 00:23:52,048
The decision is made.

470
00:23:52,048 --> 00:23:56,048
Is it a crime for NAKAYAMA to respond to
an adult suddenly?

471
00:23:56,048 --> 00:23:58,048
Or is it innocent?

472
00:23:59,048 --> 00:24:01,048
Members, please raise your cards at
once.

473
00:24:01,048 --> 00:24:04,752
Please.

474
00:24:04,752 --> 00:24:07,392
Innocent, innocent, innocent, innocent,
innocent, innocent,

475
00:24:07,392 --> 00:24:10,392
Innocent 7 votes, guilty 0 votes.

476
00:24:10,392 --> 00:24:12,392
The defendant, Nakayama, is innocent!

477
00:24:17,672 --> 00:24:09,212
In the end, Nakayama was judged to be
just a

478
00:24:09,212 --> 00:24:23,932
fortune teller, and was acquitted.

479
00:24:23,968 --> 00:24:29,968
The next episode will be more and more
heated up.

480
00:24:29,968 --> 00:24:32,968
The final episode of the TAS TAS trial.

481
00:24:32,968 --> 00:24:35,968
The suspicions of shock are coming one
after another.

482
00:24:35,968 --> 00:24:37,968
Isn't it already a sexual harassment?

483
00:24:37,968 --> 00:24:39,968
Takayama-san doesn't hate it.

484
00:24:39,968 --> 00:24:41,968
He's used to it.

485
00:24:41,968 --> 00:24:45,968
And the combination of Yasumoto and
Kobayashi.

486
00:24:45,968 --> 00:24:48,968
The suspicions that never change are
discovered.

487
00:24:48,968 --> 00:24:53,968
And the outcome of the trial is...

488
00:24:55,770 --> 00:25:00,770
