Today's daily duty: Rina Matsuno

Contents: The theme this time is “Ebichu + Daikeien”. So, what is Daikeien? In fact, this is a place that Ebichu has visited while filming a video for a concert. Matsuno, the day's direct MC, explained Daikeien, but she still couldn't tell what kind of place it was.　
　Proceeding into the park, it turns out to be a huge amusement park. Therefore, the Matsuno team and the Yasumoto team split up to face off in various games at Daikeien. Members compete in various attractions such as sumo wrestling games and dynamic visual acuity judgment games. And in the goldfish scooping competition, Matsuno shows an unexpected talent! ? A game battle that shows a messy development this time! As expected destination of victory or defeat! ?
