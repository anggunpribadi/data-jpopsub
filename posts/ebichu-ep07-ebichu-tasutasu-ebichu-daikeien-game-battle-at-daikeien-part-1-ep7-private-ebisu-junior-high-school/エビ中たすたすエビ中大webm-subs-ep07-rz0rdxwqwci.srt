1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Ebichu Tastas has started!

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:08,000
Tonight, they will deliver a big show
from a big house

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:12,000
They are excited at a mysterious huge
facility

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:24,000
The first guest of the day is a big fan
of Ebichu Tastas

5
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:32,000
The first guest of the day is a big fan
of Ebichu Tastas

6
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,106
The first guest of the day is a big fan
of Ebichu Tastas

7
00:00:34,106 --> 00:00:36,026
Bingo! Happy birthday!

8
00:00:36,026 --> 00:00:38,026
To you, middle schooler!

9
00:00:38,026 --> 00:00:40,026
Elementary schoolers

10
00:00:40,026 --> 00:00:44,026
Now it's time for the final exam!

11
00:00:44,026 --> 00:00:46,026
Bingo! Happy birthday!

12
00:00:46,026 --> 00:00:48,026
Until the end of the world!

13
00:00:48,026 --> 00:00:50,026
High schoolers

14
00:00:50,026 --> 00:00:52,026
And high schoolers

15
00:00:52,026 --> 00:00:54,026
Let's go!

16
00:00:54,026 --> 00:00:56,026
Never ending

17
00:00:56,026 --> 00:00:59,552
Bingo! Happy birthday!

18
00:00:59,552 --> 00:01:03,552
Bingo! Happy birthday!

19
00:01:04,552 --> 00:01:08,552
Add many things to your private Ebisu
junior high!

20
00:01:08,552 --> 00:01:10,552
Ebisu Justus!

21
00:01:10,552 --> 00:01:26,552
This program is brought to you by the
following sponsors.

22
00:01:27,962 --> 00:01:32,962
I, Masu, will be the MC for this show.

23
00:01:33,962 --> 00:01:35,962
Thank you.

24
00:01:35,962 --> 00:01:38,962
What is the theme of today's show?

25
00:01:38,962 --> 00:01:41,962
It's a very bright and sunny day,

26
00:01:41,962 --> 00:01:46,962
but I'll do my best to be as bright as
the sun.

27
00:01:46,962 --> 00:01:48,962
Thank you.

28
00:01:48,962 --> 00:01:49,962
Thank you.

29
00:01:49,962 --> 00:01:52,962
Is that your task?

30
00:01:52,962 --> 00:01:54,962
My task?

31
00:01:54,962 --> 00:01:57,962
It's a personal task.

32
00:01:57,962 --> 00:01:59,962
I see.

33
00:01:59,962 --> 00:02:01,962
Are you okay?

34
00:02:01,962 --> 00:02:03,962
I'm worried about you.

35
00:02:03,962 --> 00:02:04,962
Are you okay?

36
00:02:04,962 --> 00:02:06,962
What are you waiting for?

37
00:02:06,962 --> 00:02:08,962
Are you sleepy?

38
00:02:08,962 --> 00:02:10,962
It's very bright.

39
00:02:10,962 --> 00:02:12,962
You're very bright today.

40
00:02:12,962 --> 00:02:15,962
What is the theme of today's show?

41
00:02:15,962 --> 00:02:17,962
What is it?

42
00:02:17,962 --> 00:02:18,962
What is it?

43
00:02:18,962 --> 00:02:21,824
The theme of today's show is...

44
00:02:21,824 --> 00:02:23,824
It's a big park.

45
00:02:23,824 --> 00:02:25,824
It's a big park.

46
00:02:25,824 --> 00:02:27,824
Big park.

47
00:02:27,824 --> 00:02:31,824
What is a big park?

48
00:02:31,824 --> 00:02:33,824
The big park is here.

49
00:02:35,824 --> 00:02:37,824
Is it a parking lot?

50
00:02:37,824 --> 00:02:41,824
I don't know because there is only a
parking lot.

51
00:02:41,824 --> 00:02:45,824
The big park is a place to play.

52
00:02:45,824 --> 00:02:47,824
Do you know what Hoshino is?

53
00:02:47,824 --> 00:02:49,824
I know.

54
00:02:49,824 --> 00:02:51,824
I know something.

55
00:02:51,824 --> 00:02:53,824
Have you been here before?

56
00:02:53,824 --> 00:02:55,824
Who has been here?

57
00:02:55,824 --> 00:02:59,824
Have you been to Hoshino-yama at Kashua-
ge-matsu?

58
00:02:59,824 --> 00:03:01,824
What did you come here for?

59
00:03:01,824 --> 00:03:05,824
We came to shoot the OPV of Saitama
Super Arena.

60
00:03:05,824 --> 00:03:07,824
OPV?

61
00:03:07,824 --> 00:03:11,824
We came here to introduce ourselves
before the show.

62
00:03:11,824 --> 00:03:13,824
Is it like an opening video?

63
00:03:13,824 --> 00:03:15,824
Is that what OPV is?

64
00:03:15,824 --> 00:03:19,824
It's OPAPI.

65
00:03:21,824 --> 00:03:29,824
The opening video of Saitama Super Arena
was shot here.

66
00:03:29,824 --> 00:03:35,824
Mayama, Hoshino, Tashiwagi, and Matsuno
participated in the shooting.

67
00:03:35,824 --> 00:03:39,824
What kind of facility is it?

68
00:03:39,824 --> 00:03:43,824
What is the name of the place where you
have been to?

69
00:03:43,824 --> 00:03:49,824
It's a place where rich people run.

70
00:03:49,824 --> 00:03:53,824
Are you talking about the management?

71
00:03:53,824 --> 00:03:57,824
It's a dream wonderland.

72
00:03:57,824 --> 00:04:01,824
It's a dream wonderland run by rich
people.

73
00:04:01,824 --> 00:04:07,824
Let's go to the dream wonderland.

74
00:04:07,824 --> 00:04:11,824
It's amazing.

75
00:04:11,824 --> 00:04:15,824
It's like an American park.

76
00:04:15,824 --> 00:04:17,824
Wait a minute.

77
00:04:17,824 --> 00:04:19,824
It's a basketball player.

78
00:04:19,824 --> 00:04:21,824
That's too much.

79
00:04:21,824 --> 00:04:23,824
What is that person?

80
00:04:23,824 --> 00:04:27,824
Is that KAIKI?

81
00:04:27,824 --> 00:04:29,824
Everyone, I was waiting for you.

82
00:04:29,824 --> 00:04:31,824
Please decide the shot once.

83
00:04:31,824 --> 00:04:33,824
Of course.

84
00:04:33,824 --> 00:04:40,112
Please look at it.

85
00:04:40,112 --> 00:04:43,616
M-Z 2016

86
00:04:43,616 --> 00:04:44,616
Welcome!

87
00:04:44,616 --> 00:04:45,616
No, it's not welcome

88
00:04:46,616 --> 00:04:51,616
The member who still doesn't know where
to stand, the member who is good at TAS-
TAS, Kaiki Ogata

89
00:04:52,616 --> 00:04:58,616
Kaiki-san, according to the rumors, you
are a very serious person

90
00:04:58,616 --> 00:05:03,616
So this time, you came to Daiken in
advance and took a lot of materials

91
00:05:03,616 --> 00:05:04,616
That's right

92
00:05:04,616 --> 00:05:05,616
Of course

93
00:05:05,616 --> 00:05:06,616
It seems that you have looked into it

94
00:05:06,616 --> 00:05:08,616
What is Daiken?

95
00:05:08,616 --> 00:05:14,616
This is the amusement park that
Ichikawa-shi represents

96
00:05:14,616 --> 00:05:16,616
Giant amusement park

97
00:05:16,616 --> 00:05:18,672
Amusement park?

98
00:05:18,672 --> 00:05:22,672
I think the American style and kanji are
not matched.

99
00:05:22,672 --> 00:05:23,672
Is that so?

100
00:05:23,672 --> 00:05:25,672
What does the giant amusement park mean?

101
00:05:25,672 --> 00:05:27,672
The meaning?

102
00:05:27,672 --> 00:05:30,672
Let's think about the meaning together.

103
00:05:30,672 --> 00:05:31,672
You don't know?

104
00:05:31,672 --> 00:05:33,672
Let's think about it together.

105
00:05:34,672 --> 00:05:39,672
Without much information, they go inside
the giant amusement park.

106
00:05:39,672 --> 00:05:42,672
This is my favorite.

107
00:05:42,672 --> 00:05:45,672
It's a big amusement park.

108
00:05:46,672 --> 00:05:49,672
It looks like a fun game.

109
00:05:49,672 --> 00:05:51,672
I want to play this.

110
00:05:51,672 --> 00:05:54,336
Please subscribe to our channel.

111
00:05:54,336 --> 00:06:00,336
This is Daikei-en amusement park in
Chiba prefecture.

112
00:06:00,336 --> 00:06:06,336
There are game centers, baseball
stadiums, and karaoke boxes in this huge
place.

113
00:06:06,336 --> 00:06:10,336
This is a 24-hour business, the
Wonderland of dreams.

114
00:06:10,336 --> 00:06:14,336
Matsuno-san, what are you going to do
here?

115
00:06:14,336 --> 00:06:18,816
What are you going to do?

116
00:06:18,816 --> 00:06:19,816
I know!

117
00:06:19,816 --> 00:06:25,600
Today, we will be divided into two teams
and battle!

118
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:29,600
So, this is the game battle!

119
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:31,600
The teams are here!

120
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:36,600
The people who have come and the people
who haven't will be divided into two
teams and the small team will also
participate.

121
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:41,600
I would like to ask you about your
enthusiasm for the match.

122
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:44,600
Matsuno team, how is your enthusiasm?

123
00:06:44,600 --> 00:06:47,600
These two are good at games.

124
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:49,600
I have such a talent.

125
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:50,600
You are good at games!

126
00:06:50,600 --> 00:06:55,600
I'm not good at games.

127
00:06:55,600 --> 00:06:58,600
I don't like to lose.

128
00:06:58,600 --> 00:07:01,600
I know Daiken.

129
00:07:01,600 --> 00:07:03,600
I have no advantage.

130
00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:04,600
I don't lose.

131
00:07:04,600 --> 00:07:09,600
Team Yasumoto, who doesn't know Daiken,
please give us your enthusiasm.

132
00:07:10,600 --> 00:07:11,600
Go!

133
00:07:11,600 --> 00:07:12,600
Go!

134
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:14,032
Go!

135
00:07:14,032 --> 00:07:16,032
Go!

136
00:07:21,032 --> 00:07:24,032
Wait a minute. Why do you say Mayama?

137
00:07:24,032 --> 00:07:26,032
It doesn't matter. This is different.

138
00:07:26,032 --> 00:07:29,032
But this game is more fun.

139
00:07:29,032 --> 00:07:30,032
Let's go!

140
00:07:30,032 --> 00:07:31,032
Go!

141
00:07:31,032 --> 00:07:34,714
Go!

142
00:07:34,714 --> 00:07:36,714
It doesn't matter from here.

143
00:07:36,714 --> 00:07:38,714
Why did you say Kaiki-san is also a
magician?

144
00:07:38,714 --> 00:07:40,714
It's not a good thing.

145
00:07:40,714 --> 00:07:45,714
By the way, the winning team will
receive a luxurious prize.

146
00:07:45,714 --> 00:07:49,978
The prize is here!

147
00:07:49,978 --> 00:07:56,978
The winner team will get a new original
jumper

148
00:07:58,978 --> 00:08:00,978
Look at the back

149
00:08:00,978 --> 00:08:02,978
Original jumper

150
00:08:02,978 --> 00:08:04,978
Who is it?

151
00:08:04,978 --> 00:08:06,978
Whose face is this?

152
00:08:08,978 --> 00:08:10,978
The manager, Mr. Takahashi

153
00:08:10,978 --> 00:08:13,978
He is rich

154
00:08:13,978 --> 00:08:14,978
He is a commuter

155
00:08:14,978 --> 00:08:16,978
He is rich

156
00:08:16,978 --> 00:08:19,978
Please use it

157
00:08:22,978 --> 00:08:26,978
Let's start the game battle

158
00:08:27,978 --> 00:08:31,978
The first game is here

159
00:08:31,978 --> 00:08:34,978
Let's play this

160
00:08:34,978 --> 00:08:39,978
The famous sumo game

161
00:08:39,978 --> 00:08:43,248
It's a compact but a famous one

162
00:08:43,248 --> 00:08:45,248
It's a compact but a famous one

163
00:08:45,248 --> 00:08:47,248
It's a compact but a famous one

164
00:08:47,248 --> 00:08:49,248
It's a compact but a famous one

165
00:08:49,248 --> 00:08:51,248
It's a compact but a famous one

166
00:08:51,248 --> 00:08:57,504
So, let's start the battle with a snow
game!

167
00:08:57,504 --> 00:09:02,504
One representative of each team will
challenge a snow game!

168
00:09:02,504 --> 00:09:06,504
Ok, so first, the Matt team! Who will go
first?

169
00:09:06,504 --> 00:09:08,504
I will go first!

170
00:09:08,504 --> 00:09:11,504
Matsuno, you will go first? Why?

171
00:09:11,504 --> 00:09:15,504
I was told by Ogata-san to show the
spirit of the two-legged race.

172
00:09:15,504 --> 00:09:16,504
Today is the two-legged race.

173
00:09:16,504 --> 00:09:17,504
That's right.

174
00:09:17,504 --> 00:09:20,504
Ok, the Yasumoto team! Who will go
first?

175
00:09:20,504 --> 00:09:21,504
Yes!

176
00:09:21,504 --> 00:09:23,504
Yasumoto will go first! Why?

177
00:09:23,504 --> 00:09:26,504
Because I'm a rock!

178
00:09:26,504 --> 00:09:31,504
The first battle is Matsuno vs Yasumoto!

179
00:09:31,504 --> 00:09:33,504
Everyone, step on the snow!

180
00:09:33,504 --> 00:09:34,504
Oh, that's good!

181
00:09:34,504 --> 00:09:35,504
That's good!

182
00:09:35,504 --> 00:09:37,504
That's a good one!

183
00:09:37,504 --> 00:09:39,504
But it's kind of small.

184
00:09:39,504 --> 00:09:42,504
That's right. It's a good game in terms
of size.

185
00:09:42,504 --> 00:09:44,504
That's good, Matsuno!

186
00:09:44,504 --> 00:09:47,504
Matsuno will challenge!

187
00:09:47,504 --> 00:09:49,504
It hasn't started yet!

188
00:09:50,504 --> 00:09:51,504
It's moving!

189
00:09:51,504 --> 00:09:52,504
It's moving!

190
00:09:52,504 --> 00:09:53,504
It's moving!

191
00:09:53,504 --> 00:09:56,504
It's moving!

192
00:09:56,504 --> 00:09:57,504
Did you win?

193
00:09:57,504 --> 00:09:58,504
What?

194
00:09:58,504 --> 00:09:59,290
It's moving!

195
00:09:59,290 --> 00:10:06,290
It seems that he won

196
00:10:08,282 --> 00:10:10,282
What are you doing?

197
00:10:10,282 --> 00:10:12,282
I don't know

198
00:10:12,282 --> 00:10:14,282
Can I ask you something?

199
00:10:14,282 --> 00:10:16,282
If it's too far, I can't see anything

200
00:10:18,282 --> 00:10:20,282
I thought it would move more

201
00:10:20,282 --> 00:10:25,466
The distance is this much

202
00:10:25,466 --> 00:10:27,466
Did you win the result?

203
00:10:27,466 --> 00:10:28,466
Yes

204
00:10:28,466 --> 00:10:30,466
Matsuno won

205
00:10:30,466 --> 00:10:31,466
Matsuno won

206
00:10:31,466 --> 00:10:33,466
Yes

207
00:10:34,466 --> 00:10:37,466
Next, Yasumoto challenges

208
00:10:38,466 --> 00:10:40,466
I'm happy

209
00:10:40,466 --> 00:10:42,466
Yasumoto, you can do it

210
00:10:42,466 --> 00:10:43,466
Let her do it

211
00:10:43,466 --> 00:10:45,466
Good

212
00:10:45,466 --> 00:10:46,466
Good

213
00:10:46,466 --> 00:10:48,466
You can do it

214
00:10:48,466 --> 00:10:49,466
Good

215
00:10:49,466 --> 00:10:50,466
You can do it

216
00:10:50,466 --> 00:10:52,466
You can do it

217
00:10:52,466 --> 00:10:53,466
You can do it

218
00:10:53,466 --> 00:10:55,466
Good

219
00:10:55,466 --> 00:10:57,466
Nice

220
00:10:59,466 --> 00:11:01,466
You can do it

221
00:11:01,466 --> 00:11:02,466
Go

222
00:11:02,466 --> 00:11:03,466
You can do it

223
00:11:03,466 --> 00:11:05,466
Go

224
00:11:05,466 --> 00:11:07,466
Good

225
00:11:07,466 --> 00:11:09,466
You can do it

226
00:11:09,466 --> 00:11:10,466
Yasumoto

227
00:11:10,466 --> 00:11:11,466
You can do it

228
00:11:11,466 --> 00:11:12,466
I won

229
00:11:12,466 --> 00:11:13,466
I won

230
00:11:13,466 --> 00:11:15,466
I won

231
00:11:15,466 --> 00:11:16,922
Matsuno won

232
00:11:16,922 --> 00:11:19,922
Well, this is...

233
00:11:19,922 --> 00:11:23,922
I won, but I don't feel like I won at
all

234
00:11:23,922 --> 00:11:25,922
I'm happy

235
00:11:27,922 --> 00:11:31,922
In the end, the game ended without
knowing the result

236
00:11:31,922 --> 00:11:40,608
Anyway, both of them won, so they got 50
points

237
00:11:40,608 --> 00:11:44,608
The next game is this one, the body
sight game

238
00:11:47,608 --> 00:11:50,608
The second battle is the body sight game

239
00:11:51,608 --> 00:11:56,608
In 30 seconds, press the button that
glows one by one to compete for the body
sight

240
00:11:58,608 --> 00:12:02,608
If you are in your teens, 37 points or
more will be the standard score

241
00:12:02,608 --> 00:12:05,608
One representative from each team will
challenge

242
00:12:05,608 --> 00:12:09,608
Who will go first?

243
00:12:10,608 --> 00:12:12,608
Mayamo, who will go first?

244
00:12:12,608 --> 00:12:13,608
The reason is?

245
00:12:13,608 --> 00:12:16,608
The reason is? It seems fun

246
00:12:16,608 --> 00:12:21,608
I was playing soccer, so I thought I had
a reflex

247
00:12:21,608 --> 00:12:24,608
I see, you have a reflex for soccer

248
00:12:24,608 --> 00:12:25,608
I thought so

249
00:12:25,608 --> 00:12:26,608
I see, I understand

250
00:12:26,608 --> 00:12:29,608
Who will go first?

251
00:12:32,608 --> 00:12:34,608
What is it, Sakurai?

252
00:12:34,608 --> 00:12:35,608
The first is...

253
00:12:35,608 --> 00:12:37,608
It's not decided yet

254
00:12:37,608 --> 00:12:39,608
Mayamo, Mayamo, Mayamo

255
00:12:39,608 --> 00:12:41,608
Mayamo, you are alone

256
00:12:41,608 --> 00:12:45,608
Mayamo, what? You want to enter this
team from the beginning

257
00:12:45,608 --> 00:12:49,608
You are going to enter the soccer team

258
00:12:49,608 --> 00:12:53,608
And the Yasumoto team is decided to go
to Nakayama

259
00:12:53,608 --> 00:12:55,808
I have done it before

260
00:12:55,808 --> 00:12:56,808
I have done it once

261
00:12:56,808 --> 00:12:57,808
You are experienced

262
00:12:57,808 --> 00:13:02,808
I am experienced but I couldn't do it
once

263
00:13:02,808 --> 00:13:04,808
Then why Nakayama?

264
00:13:04,808 --> 00:13:05,808
You have to win

265
00:13:05,808 --> 00:13:13,408
The oldest in the team, Mayama VS The
youngest, Nakayama

266
00:13:13,408 --> 00:13:19,408
Mayama is the first. Can she beat
Nakayama's youth with the skills she
learned in soccer?

267
00:13:21,408 --> 00:13:25,408
3, 2, 1, start!

268
00:13:25,408 --> 00:13:35,408
Nakayama is the first. Can she beat
Nakayama's youth with the skills she
learned in soccer?

269
00:13:38,192 --> 00:13:48,192
Nakayama is the first to beat Nakayama's
youth with the skills she learned in
soccer.

270
00:13:48,192 --> 00:13:57,786
Nakayama is the first to beat Nakayama's
youth with the skills she learned in
soccer.

271
00:13:57,786 --> 00:14:03,786
Mayama's score is only 19 points

272
00:14:03,786 --> 00:14:06,786
Her body sight is over 60 years old

273
00:14:06,786 --> 00:14:09,786
She is in her 48th year of middle school

274
00:14:09,786 --> 00:14:10,786
It's difficult

275
00:14:10,786 --> 00:14:12,786
Mayama, try it

276
00:14:12,786 --> 00:14:13,786
It's difficult

277
00:14:13,786 --> 00:14:14,786
It's difficult

278
00:14:14,786 --> 00:14:16,786
It's difficult

279
00:14:17,786 --> 00:14:19,786
It's difficult

280
00:14:19,786 --> 00:14:20,786
It's difficult

281
00:14:20,786 --> 00:14:21,786
I see

282
00:14:21,786 --> 00:14:23,786
Next, the Kesson team

283
00:14:23,786 --> 00:14:24,786
Mayama

284
00:14:24,786 --> 00:14:25,786
Go, Mayama

285
00:14:25,786 --> 00:14:27,786
Go for it

286
00:14:27,786 --> 00:14:31,786
Next, the youngest, 14 years old,
Nakayama

287
00:14:31,786 --> 00:14:33,786
It's easy

288
00:14:34,786 --> 00:14:35,786
Nakayama, let's go

289
00:14:35,786 --> 00:14:38,786
3, 2, 1

290
00:14:39,786 --> 00:14:40,786
Go

291
00:14:40,786 --> 00:14:41,786
Go

292
00:14:41,786 --> 00:14:42,786
Go

293
00:14:42,786 --> 00:14:43,786
Go

294
00:14:43,786 --> 00:14:44,786
Go

295
00:14:44,786 --> 00:14:45,786
Go

296
00:14:45,786 --> 00:14:46,786
Go

297
00:14:46,786 --> 00:14:47,786
Go

298
00:14:47,786 --> 00:14:48,786
Go

299
00:14:48,786 --> 00:14:49,786
Go

300
00:14:49,786 --> 00:14:50,786
Go

301
00:14:50,786 --> 00:14:51,786
Go

302
00:14:51,786 --> 00:14:52,786
Go

303
00:14:52,786 --> 00:14:53,786
Go, Nakayama

304
00:14:53,786 --> 00:14:54,786
Go

305
00:14:54,786 --> 00:14:55,786
Go

306
00:14:57,114 --> 00:15:00,114
I'm not doing it.

307
00:15:00,114 --> 00:15:03,114
I'm not doing it.

308
00:15:03,114 --> 00:15:06,114
I'm not doing it.

309
00:15:06,114 --> 00:15:09,114
I'm not doing it.

310
00:15:09,114 --> 00:15:12,114
I'm not doing it.

311
00:15:12,114 --> 00:15:14,114
I'm not doing it.

312
00:15:14,114 --> 00:15:18,114
Nakayama also got 19 points, just like
Mayama.

313
00:15:18,114 --> 00:15:22,288
In other words, her body has a history
of more than 60 years.

314
00:15:22,288 --> 00:15:24,288
Nakayama, how was it?

315
00:15:24,288 --> 00:15:27,288
It was fun. I was going like this.

316
00:15:27,288 --> 00:15:29,288
You were wrong.

317
00:15:29,288 --> 00:15:31,288
You were going like this.

318
00:15:32,288 --> 00:15:36,288
So, the team got a draw for a low-level
battle.

319
00:15:36,288 --> 00:15:41,008
No team score.

320
00:15:41,008 --> 00:15:45,008
By the way, who is the most athletic
among the members?

321
00:15:46,008 --> 00:15:47,008
Matsuno

322
00:15:47,008 --> 00:15:48,008
Matsuno?

323
00:15:48,008 --> 00:15:49,008
I heard you are a big fat person

324
00:15:49,008 --> 00:15:50,008
Oh my god

325
00:15:50,008 --> 00:15:51,008
Oh my god

326
00:15:51,008 --> 00:15:52,008
I'm so big fat

327
00:15:52,008 --> 00:15:54,008
How do you feel?

328
00:15:54,008 --> 00:15:56,008
I can move around in a place where there
is nothing

329
00:15:56,008 --> 00:16:00,008
And I'm big fat in the whole movement

330
00:16:00,008 --> 00:16:01,008
The whole movement

331
00:16:02,008 --> 00:16:05,008
Certainly, today is the opening shooting
day

332
00:16:05,008 --> 00:16:07,008
Everyone is gathered, but Matsuno walks
slowly

333
00:16:07,008 --> 00:16:12,008
Everyone is running, gathering, and
Matsuno

334
00:16:12,008 --> 00:16:15,008
I don't want to do something that is
useless

335
00:16:15,008 --> 00:16:16,008
It's useless

336
00:16:16,008 --> 00:16:17,008
Everyone is gathered

337
00:16:17,008 --> 00:16:20,008
It doesn't matter if you play this game,
you are already in your 60s

338
00:16:21,008 --> 00:16:25,008
Well, let's go

339
00:16:25,008 --> 00:16:26,008
What are you talking about?

340
00:16:28,008 --> 00:16:29,008
Let's go

341
00:16:29,008 --> 00:16:30,008
Let's go

342
00:16:30,008 --> 00:16:31,008
Please go

343
00:16:32,008 --> 00:16:33,008
Let's go

344
00:16:33,008 --> 00:16:37,008
Matsuno also challenges the dynamic
eyesight game

345
00:16:39,008 --> 00:16:43,008
3, 2, 1, start

346
00:16:43,008 --> 00:16:49,760
The result of the shock is

347
00:16:49,760 --> 00:16:51,760
test the appendectomy ofを

I do not

351
00:16:59,460 --> 00:17:01,460
Start!

352
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:08,600

tue

356
00:17:28,760 --> 00:17:29,664
Thank you for watching!

357
00:17:34,298 --> 00:17:37,298
The highest score ever

358
00:17:42,298 --> 00:17:44,298
It's the same as the game we played
before

359
00:17:45,298 --> 00:17:47,298
It was about to break

360
00:17:47,298 --> 00:17:48,298
Amazing

361
00:17:49,298 --> 00:17:50,298
Amazing

362
00:17:50,298 --> 00:17:52,298
This is the highest score ever

363
00:17:52,298 --> 00:17:53,298
Yay

364
00:17:53,298 --> 00:17:54,298
Amazing

365
00:17:54,298 --> 00:17:55,298
Amazing

366
00:17:56,298 --> 00:17:58,298
Matsuno got the highest score

367
00:17:58,298 --> 00:18:01,298
But her physical ability is over 40
years old

368
00:18:01,298 --> 00:18:05,104
That's it. original

369
00:18:05,104 --> 00:18:07,104
I want to go out.

370
00:18:07,104 --> 00:18:11,104
Everyone, here it is.

371
00:18:11,104 --> 00:18:13,104
What is it?

372
00:18:13,104 --> 00:18:15,104
It says it's a big system.

373
00:18:15,104 --> 00:18:19,104
Please come in here.

374
00:18:19,104 --> 00:18:21,104
It's like a festival.

375
00:18:23,104 --> 00:18:25,104
There's a goldfish.

376
00:18:25,104 --> 00:18:27,104
It's a goldfish rescue.

377
00:18:27,104 --> 00:18:29,104
That's great.

378
00:18:29,104 --> 00:18:31,104
A goldfish rescue battle.

379
00:18:31,104 --> 00:18:33,104
That's great.

380
00:18:33,104 --> 00:18:37,104
The third battle is a goldfish rescue.

381
00:18:37,104 --> 00:18:39,104
Everyone, here it is.

382
00:18:39,104 --> 00:18:41,104
It's a competition.

383
00:18:41,104 --> 00:18:45,104
How many goldfish can you rescue in one
minute?

384
00:18:45,104 --> 00:18:49,104
Each team will compete.

385
00:18:51,104 --> 00:18:53,104
The first is the Matsuno team.

386
00:18:55,104 --> 00:18:57,104
Ready, start.

387
00:18:57,104 --> 00:19:01,104
What if you break your voice?

388
00:19:01,104 --> 00:19:03,104
Good luck.

389
00:19:03,104 --> 00:19:10,928
Everyone is broken in an instant.

390
00:19:10,928 --> 00:19:12,928
At that moment, Mayama said...

391
00:19:12,928 --> 00:19:14,928
I'm sorry.

392
00:19:14,928 --> 00:19:18,928
Mayama is gone.

393
00:19:18,928 --> 00:19:20,928
10 seconds left.

394
00:19:20,928 --> 00:19:22,928
Everyone, do your best.

395
00:19:22,928 --> 00:19:24,928
You can't stop.

396
00:19:24,928 --> 00:19:26,928
Mayama is amazing.

397
00:19:26,928 --> 00:19:28,928
End.

398
00:19:28,928 --> 00:19:31,088
Everyone is broken.

399
00:19:31,088 --> 00:19:35,088
2 of them. 2 of them.

400
00:19:35,088 --> 00:19:37,088
Mayama got 2 of them.

401
00:19:37,088 --> 00:19:39,088
Amazing.

402
00:19:39,088 --> 00:19:41,088
Amazing, Mayama.

403
00:19:41,088 --> 00:19:47,872
As a result, Matsuno team only got 2
Mayama.

404
00:19:47,872 --> 00:19:50,872
Now, this is Yasumoto team.

405
00:19:51,872 --> 00:19:54,872
Next, we are Yasumoto team.

406
00:19:55,872 --> 00:19:57,872
There is something I want to say.

407
00:19:57,872 --> 00:20:08,912
If goldfish is put in the orange world,
it will be surprised.

408
00:20:08,912 --> 00:20:10,912
Hey, you are going to go again.

409
00:20:10,912 --> 00:20:11,912
Right?

410
00:20:11,912 --> 00:20:19,856
If goldfish is put in the green world,
the world will change.

411
00:20:19,856 --> 00:20:21,856
It's a story of goldfish.

412
00:20:21,856 --> 00:20:23,856
It's a story of goldfish.

413
00:20:23,856 --> 00:20:25,856
What should I do?

414
00:20:25,856 --> 00:20:27,856
I'll ask the director later.

415
00:20:27,856 --> 00:20:29,856
I'll ask the director later.

416
00:20:29,856 --> 00:20:31,856
Listen to me.

417
00:20:31,856 --> 00:20:33,856
One minute.

418
00:20:33,856 --> 00:20:35,856
Come on.

419
00:20:35,856 --> 00:20:37,856
Listen to me.

420
00:20:37,856 --> 00:20:39,856
It's wet.

421
00:20:41,856 --> 00:20:43,856
Good luck.

422
00:20:43,856 --> 00:20:45,856
10 seconds.

423
00:20:45,856 --> 00:20:47,856
One goldfish.

424
00:20:47,856 --> 00:20:49,856
Put water in it.

425
00:20:49,856 --> 00:20:51,856
Put water in it.

426
00:20:51,856 --> 00:20:53,856
Kaho, Kaho, you're in trouble.

427
00:20:53,856 --> 00:20:55,856
Kaho, Kaho.

428
00:20:55,856 --> 00:20:57,856
Kaho, Kaho, you're in trouble.

429
00:20:57,856 --> 00:20:59,856
The goldfish is torn.

430
00:20:59,856 --> 00:21:01,856
5

431
00:21:01,856 --> 00:21:03,856
4

432
00:21:03,856 --> 00:21:05,856
3

433
00:21:05,856 --> 00:21:07,856
2

434
00:21:07,856 --> 00:21:09,018
1

435
00:21:09,018 --> 00:21:10,018
Amazing

436
00:21:10,018 --> 00:21:12,018
So, the race is over

437
00:21:13,018 --> 00:21:15,018
The result is one

438
00:21:15,018 --> 00:21:19,280
Matsuno team wins

439
00:21:19,280 --> 00:21:21,280
However

440
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:23,280
This is really big

441
00:21:23,280 --> 00:21:25,280
Please give me a lot of points

442
00:21:25,280 --> 00:21:27,280
This is the one I mentioned before

443
00:21:27,280 --> 00:21:29,280
The small one is the second one

444
00:21:29,280 --> 00:21:31,280
Small

445
00:21:31,280 --> 00:21:33,280
This is certainly a big one

446
00:21:33,280 --> 00:21:35,280
This is special

447
00:21:35,280 --> 00:21:40,538
Let's give them the same score

448
00:21:40,538 --> 00:21:44,538
So, the challenge continues.

449
00:21:44,538 --> 00:21:47,538
The challenge starts with the Yasumoto
team.

450
00:21:48,538 --> 00:21:50,538
First, we will go to the Yasumoto team.

451
00:21:50,538 --> 00:21:52,538
Ready, start!

452
00:21:53,538 --> 00:21:54,538
Hey, hey!

453
00:21:54,538 --> 00:21:56,538
Hey, hey!

454
00:21:56,538 --> 00:21:57,538
What's that?

455
00:21:57,538 --> 00:21:59,538
In 5 seconds!

456
00:21:59,538 --> 00:22:03,538
Nakayama is out in 5 seconds.

457
00:22:04,538 --> 00:22:05,538
What?

458
00:22:05,538 --> 00:22:08,144
In 5 seconds!

459
00:22:08,144 --> 00:22:13,664
And next to him, Yasumoto and Hirota
also fall

460
00:22:16,624 --> 00:22:18,624
In the meantime, Chuei...

461
00:22:18,624 --> 00:22:20,624
He's getting it!

462
00:22:20,624 --> 00:22:22,624
He got one!

463
00:22:22,624 --> 00:22:24,624
He's getting it!

464
00:22:24,624 --> 00:22:27,328
Awesome!

465
00:22:27,328 --> 00:22:28,328
Awesome!

466
00:22:28,328 --> 00:22:31,328
As a result, there are 2 Chuei!

467
00:22:33,328 --> 00:22:36,328
Somehow, Chuei managed to save 2 Chuei

468
00:22:38,328 --> 00:22:41,328
Next, the Matsuno team's challenge

469
00:22:41,328 --> 00:22:49,210
The Matsuno team, ready, start!

470
00:22:49,210 --> 00:22:51,210
Amazing!

471
00:22:51,210 --> 00:22:53,210
Ah!

472
00:22:53,210 --> 00:22:55,210
The bridge is broken!

473
00:22:55,210 --> 00:23:04,400
Bye bye!

474
00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:08,400
On the other hand, Matsuno is acting
suspiciously

475
00:23:09,400 --> 00:23:10,400
Then...

476
00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:14,400
Oh! Matsuno is going too!

477
00:23:15,400 --> 00:23:17,400
Furthermore...

478
00:23:17,400 --> 00:23:19,400
He gave up!

479
00:23:19,400 --> 00:23:21,400
He's going to lose!

480
00:23:21,400 --> 00:23:23,400
Wait! This is scary!

481
00:23:23,400 --> 00:23:25,400
Kashiwagi too!

482
00:23:25,400 --> 00:23:27,400
He's going to lose!

483
00:23:27,400 --> 00:23:29,400
He's going to lose!

484
00:23:29,400 --> 00:23:31,400
Matsuno is amazing!

485
00:23:31,400 --> 00:23:33,400
Matsuno is amazing!

486
00:23:33,400 --> 00:23:35,400
Matsuno is amazing!

487
00:23:35,616 --> 00:23:37,616
Oh, I got it!

488
00:23:37,616 --> 00:23:39,616
That was unexpected!

489
00:23:39,616 --> 00:23:41,616
All of a sudden!

490
00:23:41,616 --> 00:23:43,616
As the Yasumoto team stands up...

491
00:23:45,616 --> 00:23:51,616
As a result, Kashiwagi got one, Ogata
got three, and Matsuno got four.

492
00:23:51,616 --> 00:23:54,848
They got a lot of them!

493
00:23:54,848 --> 00:23:57,848
Team Katsunoki won!

494
00:23:59,848 --> 00:24:01,848
It's my first time to win this much!

495
00:24:01,848 --> 00:24:03,848
Katsunoki, you suddenly woke up!

496
00:24:03,848 --> 00:24:04,848
I'm so happy!

497
00:24:04,848 --> 00:24:05,848
How are you feeling?

498
00:24:05,848 --> 00:24:07,848
It's my first time to win this much!

499
00:24:07,848 --> 00:24:08,848
How did you do it?

500
00:24:08,848 --> 00:24:10,848
I was sleeping on the top of the car all
the time.

501
00:24:10,848 --> 00:24:12,848
I thought I was going to win, so I got
up.

502
00:24:12,848 --> 00:24:14,848
Ms. Kaiki, you're done.

503
00:24:14,848 --> 00:24:15,848
But I didn't lose.

504
00:24:15,848 --> 00:24:16,848
Please let me win the big one.

505
00:24:16,848 --> 00:24:17,848
I see.

506
00:24:17,848 --> 00:24:21,848
Ms. Kaiki hasn't lost yet.

507
00:24:21,848 --> 00:24:24,848
I thought you were going to drink it.

508
00:24:24,848 --> 00:24:25,848
I'm scared.

509
00:24:25,848 --> 00:24:26,848
I'm scared.

510
00:24:26,848 --> 00:24:27,848
I'm scared.

511
00:24:27,848 --> 00:24:28,848
I'm scared.

512
00:24:29,848 --> 00:24:32,848
The third battle is the victory of the
Matsuno team.

513
00:24:32,848 --> 00:24:38,448
The final score is 50 points.

514
00:24:38,448 --> 00:24:44,448
So, if you add a large circle in the
middle of the shrimp,

515
00:24:44,448 --> 00:24:50,448
the result is 20 point username.

516
00:24:50,448 --> 00:24:53,348
