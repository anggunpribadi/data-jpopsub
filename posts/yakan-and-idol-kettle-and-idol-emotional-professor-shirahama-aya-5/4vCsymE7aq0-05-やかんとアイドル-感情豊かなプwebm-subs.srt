7
00:00:14,256 --> 00:00:19,256
Could you tell us about the event?

8
00:00:19,256 --> 00:00:20,256
Yes!

9
00:00:20,256 --> 00:00:23,256
There is a VOLT One-One Live!

10
00:00:23,256 --> 00:00:29,256
On December 23, the LUNA Festival will
be held at Yokohama Bay Hall!

11
00:00:30,256 --> 00:00:31,256
That's right!

12
00:00:31,256 --> 00:00:35,256
It's a one-one live for Luna's birthday.

13
00:00:35,256 --> 00:00:42,256
We always do the LUNA Festival every
year.

14
00:00:42,256 --> 00:00:46,256
Luna is planning the event.

15
00:00:46,256 --> 00:00:52,256
She always thinks about us even though
it's her birthday.

16
00:00:52,256 --> 00:00:53,256
Really?

17
00:00:53,256 --> 00:00:56,256
Luna thinks about us. Chi-chan, think
about us.

18
00:00:56,256 --> 00:00:58,256
Chi-chan is thinking about us.

19
00:00:58,256 --> 00:01:00,256
Don't talk about that!

20
00:01:01,256 --> 00:01:03,256
Sorry, I'm sorry.

21
00:01:03,256 --> 00:01:05,256
Chi-chan is thinking about us.

22
00:01:05,256 --> 00:01:14,256
Chi-chan was already doing it last year,
but she was playing drums.

23
00:01:14,256 --> 00:01:17,256
She was playing a new song.

24
00:01:17,256 --> 00:01:23,256
Chi-chan is not saying that she is bad.

25
00:01:23,256 --> 00:01:28,256
There are many things to do together.

26
00:01:28,256 --> 00:01:30,256
You can't follow everything.

27
00:01:30,256 --> 00:01:34,256
I'm sorry.

28
00:01:34,256 --> 00:01:41,256
We are happy to have you here.

29
00:01:41,256 --> 00:01:44,256
I was saved by a junior high school
student.

30
00:01:44,256 --> 00:01:46,256
There is one more thing.

31
00:01:46,256 --> 00:01:52,256
VOLT's 4th single will be released on
December 14.

32
00:01:52,256 --> 00:02:06,256
The first limited edition Blu-ray will
record the 3rd anniversary live and the
tour final.

33
00:02:06,256 --> 00:02:10,256
I hope you are looking forward to it.

34
00:02:10,256 --> 00:02:16,256
The release event is also in progress.

35
00:02:16,256 --> 00:02:20,256
Please come to the event.

36
00:02:20,256 --> 00:02:25,256
Please check the official site of VOLT.

37
00:02:25,256 --> 00:02:31,256
I pray for you next year.

38
00:02:31,256 --> 00:02:34,256
I want you to drink tea from me.

39
00:02:34,256 --> 00:02:37,256
Thank you.

40
00:02:38,256 --> 00:02:43,256
Today is Shizuoka tea.

41
00:02:43,256 --> 00:02:46,256
I drink Shizuoka tea for the first time.

42
00:02:46,256 --> 00:02:47,256
Really?

43
00:02:47,256 --> 00:02:49,344
Yes.

44
00:02:49,344 --> 00:02:51,344
Wow!

45
00:02:51,344 --> 00:02:53,344
The tea smells good.

46
00:02:53,344 --> 00:03:00,698
Thank you for your watching.

47
00:03:00,698 --> 00:03:02,698
It's delicious.

48
00:03:02,698 --> 00:03:04,698
It's delicious.

49
00:03:04,698 --> 00:03:10,698
I feel relaxed when drinking tea.

50
00:03:10,698 --> 00:03:15,698
I want to have a tea time with Yakan-kun
at VOLT.

51
00:03:15,698 --> 00:03:17,698
Thank you.

52
00:03:17,698 --> 00:03:19,698
I feel warm.

53
00:03:19,698 --> 00:03:25,698
Please say goodbye to the camera.

54
00:03:25,698 --> 00:03:30,698
Please say goodbye to the camera.

55
00:03:30,698 --> 00:03:37,698
Thank you for watching until the end.

56
00:03:37,698 --> 00:03:39,698
I'm advertising.

57
00:03:39,698 --> 00:03:43,698
I'm also doing Instagram.

Bye bye.
