1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
I want to be an old idol like THE IDOL.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:27,000
I want to do everything I can.

3
00:00:27,674 --> 00:00:33,674
I'm not qualified to love you

4
00:00:35,674 --> 00:00:39,674
The reason why my parents met me was

5
00:00:39,674 --> 00:00:43,674
I listened to my dad's song and my mom
fell in love with it

6
00:00:43,674 --> 00:00:46,674
and got married

7
00:00:46,674 --> 00:00:49,674
That's how much I love my parents' songs

8
00:00:49,674 --> 00:00:54,674
My parents raised me by singing a lot at
home

9
00:00:54,674 --> 00:00:56,928
That's why I love singing

10
00:00:56,928 --> 00:01:05,928
I have a habit of singing a lot at home
and outside

11
00:01:10,202 --> 00:01:18,202
When I was in elementary school, I was
playing tennis in the first grade of
elementary school.

12
00:01:18,202 --> 00:01:21,202
I was like a sports girl with a dark
skin.

13
00:01:21,202 --> 00:01:25,202
I had short hair and black tan.

14
00:01:25,202 --> 00:01:28,202
I was mistaken for a boy.

15
00:01:29,202 --> 00:01:36,202
I thought that this kind of appearance
would be dangerous when I was in junior
high school.

16
00:01:36,202 --> 00:01:39,696
I was mistaken for a girl.

17
00:01:39,696 --> 00:01:44,096
I tried to look as red as possible.

18
00:01:44,096 --> 00:01:47,296
My skin turned a little white.

19
00:01:47,296 --> 00:01:55,056
I met a musical when I was in the second
grade of junior high school.

20
00:01:55,056 --> 00:02:01,216
I went to see a musical that my friend
was in.

21
00:02:01,216 --> 00:02:06,816
I was so absorbed in singing and
dancing.

22
00:02:06,816 --> 00:02:08,304
I was so absorbed in singing and
dancing.

23
00:02:08,304 --> 00:02:18,304
I was so interested in how different
people could express themselves.

24
00:02:18,304 --> 00:02:24,304
I watched the musical and told my mom
that I wanted to be in it.

25
00:02:24,304 --> 00:02:28,304
I joined a musical troupe.

26
00:02:28,304 --> 00:02:33,304
I was still not confident in myself at
first.

27
00:02:33,304 --> 00:02:36,912
I thought I couldn't do it.

28
00:02:36,912 --> 00:02:42,412
I thought I could express myself better.

29
00:02:42,412 --> 00:02:46,792
I thought I could reach the audience.

30
00:02:46,792 --> 00:02:51,092
I felt like my color was broken.

31
00:02:51,092 --> 00:02:56,052
I thought I should try as much as I
could.

32
00:02:56,052 --> 00:03:00,052
I wanted to learn more from myself.

33
00:03:00,052 --> 00:03:06,240
I wanted to be cuter.

34
00:03:06,240 --> 00:03:15,040
If I hadn't been in a musical, I
wouldn't be standing here today.

35
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:23,160
I think I would have lived without
confidence.

36
00:03:23,160 --> 00:03:30,080
I've only lived for 17 years, but I
think it was the turning point of my
life.

37
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:37,560
That's where I changed.

38
00:03:37,658 --> 00:03:42,658
I'm RIO SHIMIZU, 17 years old, from
SHIWA.

39
00:03:42,658 --> 00:03:46,658
I met HINATATAKA46 when I was in the
first year of high school.

40
00:03:46,658 --> 00:03:49,658
I wanted to shine in this group.

41
00:03:49,658 --> 00:03:53,658
I wanted to attract people who are
watching and make them smile.

42
00:03:53,658 --> 00:03:58,658
I tried a lot of singing, dancing, and
self-reflecting.

43
00:03:58,658 --> 00:04:01,658
When I first saw them,

44
00:04:01,658 --> 00:04:07,658
I was inspired by the energy and
freshness of other groups.

45
00:04:07,728 --> 00:04:11,728
I was inspired by the energy of other
groups.

46
00:04:11,728 --> 00:04:19,728
Many people told me that I was energetic
and good.

47
00:04:19,728 --> 00:04:22,728
I thought I could shine here.

48
00:04:23,728 --> 00:04:27,728
I've been listening to this song a lot
during the exam.

49
00:04:27,728 --> 00:04:31,728
This is my favorite song.

50
00:04:31,728 --> 00:04:37,536
I'm trying to tell people to do their
best.

51
00:04:37,536 --> 00:04:43,036
I think I've been pushed back by that.

52
00:04:43,036 --> 00:04:47,536
I've been listening to 《Seishun no
Uma》for a long time,

53
00:04:47,536 --> 00:04:50,536
and I decided to take the audition.

54
00:04:50,536 --> 00:04:55,036
I thought it would be over if I gave up
here.

55
00:04:55,036 --> 00:05:00,536
I decided to take the audition after
listening to 《Seishun no Uma》.

56
00:05:00,536 --> 00:05:06,192
I didn't think I'd make it, but I did my
best.

57
00:05:06,192 --> 00:05:08,692
I didn't think I'd make it.

58
00:05:09,392 --> 00:05:11,692
Number 2, Rio Shimizu.

59
00:05:13,492 --> 00:05:17,892
The moment I heard my name, I couldn't
believe it.

60
00:05:17,892 --> 00:05:19,692
I couldn't cry.

61
00:05:21,692 --> 00:05:26,292
I couldn't cry much. I was so shocked.

62
00:05:26,292 --> 00:05:29,492
I wanted to be in the team forever.

63
00:05:29,492 --> 00:05:33,992
I'm still in the starting line.

64
00:05:33,992 --> 00:05:35,328
From now on...

65
00:05:35,328 --> 00:05:42,328
I hope I can keep my first year of being
a member of the team.

66
00:05:42,328 --> 00:05:54,328
I think the time will come when the 4th
generation will lead the team.

67
00:05:54,328 --> 00:06:03,024
I want to be a person who can lead the
team.

68
00:06:03,024 --> 00:06:07,024
The first day of the rehearsal

69
00:06:07,024 --> 00:06:09,024
I wonder if we can finish it.

70
00:06:09,024 --> 00:06:11,024
It's been three days.

71
00:06:11,024 --> 00:06:14,024
But the moment we finished it, it was
amazing.

72
00:06:14,024 --> 00:06:18,024
I talked to Rio a lot, but...

73
00:06:18,024 --> 00:06:20,024
I felt so relieved.

74
00:06:20,024 --> 00:06:23,024
Rio's performance was really good.

75
00:06:23,024 --> 00:06:27,024
I'm glad I can rely on her.

76
00:06:27,024 --> 00:06:29,024
She's a good dancer.

77
00:06:29,024 --> 00:06:31,392
I'm so happy.

78
00:06:31,392 --> 00:06:41,392
I want to be an old idol like THE IDOL.

79
00:06:43,392 --> 00:06:45,392
It's okay. It's okay.

80
00:06:45,392 --> 00:06:47,392
Calm down. Calm down.

81
00:06:47,392 --> 00:06:49,392
Smile. Smile. Smile.

82
00:06:49,392 --> 00:06:51,392
You're going to be like you always are.

83
00:06:51,392 --> 00:06:53,392
Do your best!

84
00:06:53,392 --> 00:06:59,392
What makes me who I am now?

85
00:07:00,192 --> 00:07:13,192
I think I became a person who is
cheerful and has a lot of smiles when I
entered high school and joined the dance
club.

86
00:07:13,192 --> 00:07:15,192
I want to dance to the cheer.

87
00:07:15,192 --> 00:07:28,058
I have the image of a cheer that is a
stadium, so I want to go to the stadium
and dance.

88
00:07:28,058 --> 00:07:30,058
You've got a girlfriend.

89
00:07:30,058 --> 00:07:32,058
Yes, I'm happy.

90
00:07:32,058 --> 00:07:34,058
How about here?

91
00:07:34,058 --> 00:07:36,058
What did you do?

92
00:07:36,058 --> 00:07:44,058
I danced with my friends several times
this summer.

93
00:07:50,058 --> 00:07:52,058
Wow, amazing.

94
00:07:52,058 --> 00:07:54,058
Can I go in?

95
00:07:54,058 --> 00:07:56,928
Yes, you can.

96
00:07:56,928 --> 00:07:58,928
I'm so happy.

97
00:08:00,528 --> 00:08:02,528
Is this okay?

98
00:08:08,728 --> 00:08:10,728
I danced over there.

99
00:08:10,728 --> 00:08:12,728
Where did you dance?

100
00:08:12,728 --> 00:08:14,728
At the edge.

101
00:08:14,728 --> 00:08:15,728
Yes.

102
00:08:15,728 --> 00:08:17,728
At the edge.

103
00:08:20,928 --> 00:08:22,728
This is the view.

104
00:08:22,728 --> 00:08:26,544
It's wider than when I was looking from
above.

105
00:08:26,544 --> 00:08:32,544
It's closer than I thought.

106
00:08:32,544 --> 00:08:35,544
You can see my face clearly.

107
00:08:37,544 --> 00:08:43,544
It's amazing to think that this is where
I'll be buried.

108
00:08:44,544 --> 00:08:47,544
I was so happy to be supported.

109
00:08:47,544 --> 00:08:54,544
I'm so happy to be here for the first
time.

110
00:08:54,672 --> 00:08:58,672
I can't believe how many people are
here.

111
00:08:58,672 --> 00:09:00,672
I miss this place.

112
00:09:04,672 --> 00:09:06,672
Do you remember this place?

113
00:09:06,672 --> 00:09:08,672
Yes, I do.

114
00:09:08,672 --> 00:09:10,672
It's so vivid.

115
00:09:10,672 --> 00:09:14,672
I love the view from the top.

116
00:09:14,672 --> 00:09:16,672
It's beautiful.

117
00:09:16,672 --> 00:09:22,672
When I was told that this is the place,

118
00:09:22,672 --> 00:09:22,944
I was so happy.

119
00:09:22,944 --> 00:09:30,264
I was surprised, but I was happy to see
the whole from the edge.

120
00:09:30,264 --> 00:09:32,664
Here it is.

121
00:09:32,664 --> 00:09:35,144
Here.

122
00:09:35,424 --> 00:09:37,704
Oh.

123
00:09:37,704 --> 00:09:42,184
This way. I danced here.

124
00:09:42,184 --> 00:09:47,232
I always roll around.

125
00:09:47,232 --> 00:09:50,232
I watch it with a flutter.

126
00:09:50,232 --> 00:09:53,232
But in the end, I feel like they'll
always turn it around.

127
00:09:53,232 --> 00:09:55,232
It was a winning strategy.

128
00:09:58,232 --> 00:10:02,232
I thought I could cheer for people

129
00:10:02,232 --> 00:10:05,232
and improve my expressiveness.

130
00:10:05,232 --> 00:10:07,232
So I joined the cheer dance club.

131
00:10:08,232 --> 00:10:10,232
Due to the influence of COVID-19,

132
00:10:10,232 --> 00:10:13,440
I couldn't participate in competitions
and couldn't cheer for people.

133
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:23,440
I was surprised to hear that I could
cheer for people for the first time this
summer.

134
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:29,440
I remember it was very fresh.

135
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:36,440
I may have said it in a bad way, but I
thought I couldn't do it anyway.

136
00:10:36,440 --> 00:10:42,960
I couldn't do it because I couldn't do
it with my classmates.

137
00:10:42,960 --> 00:10:49,760
I was doing it with my classmates, and
when I really could do it, I couldn't do
the best performance.

138
00:10:49,760 --> 00:11:10,490
We talked about difficult things
together and worked hard for two years.

139
00:11:18,554 --> 00:11:24,554
I realized that I had been working hard
for this moment.

140
00:11:32,090 --> 00:11:38,090
I was about to cry when the teacher told
me that my eyes were sparkling.

141
00:11:40,090 --> 00:11:42,090
I can't forget it.

142
00:11:45,090 --> 00:11:59,090
My parents asked me if I would continue
to do club activities.

143
00:11:59,090 --> 00:12:01,090
But I can't forget it.

144
00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:08,160
If I have hope, I want to do my best to
the end.

145
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:24,218
I'm glad I was able to do it with my
fellow students.

146
00:12:24,218 --> 00:12:28,218
I'm a member of the cheer dance club.

147
00:12:28,218 --> 00:12:34,218
I want to tell everyone in the dance
club.

148
00:12:34,218 --> 00:12:39,218
When I reenacted it, I said,

149
00:12:39,218 --> 00:12:43,218
I will join the Minatazaka 46.

150
00:12:43,218 --> 00:12:45,218
Then everyone said,

151
00:12:45,218 --> 00:12:52,320
The sound of the music was so loud that
I was shaking.

152
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:56,820
I was so happy that I almost cried.

153
00:12:56,820 --> 00:12:58,820
Everyone was cheering for me.

154
00:12:58,820 --> 00:13:03,820
I had a poem written right after the
event.

155
00:13:03,820 --> 00:13:07,820
Everyone was cheering for me.

156
00:13:08,820 --> 00:13:15,320
I've been cheering for others a lot in
my life.

157
00:13:15,320 --> 00:13:22,320
I hope that my fans will continue to
support me.

158
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:27,320
I can't imagine what it would be like.

159
00:13:27,320 --> 00:13:35,320
I want to repay my fans with a smile.

160
00:13:35,320 --> 00:13:49,320
I'm RIO SHIMIZU, 17 years old, from
SHIBA.
