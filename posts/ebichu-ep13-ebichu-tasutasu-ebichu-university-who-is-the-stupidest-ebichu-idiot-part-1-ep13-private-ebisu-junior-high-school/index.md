Today's direct: Mirei Hoshina

Contents: Let's add "various things" to the idol group Shiritsu Ebisu Junior High School! The theme this time is "University". The concept of Ebichu is to be an eternal junior high school student, so the idea is to try to become a college student for one day. Visit an actual university and experience campus life! When I thought about it, the members suddenly told me that she was holding the entrance exam for the private Ebisu University. First of all, to determine whether the member's academic ability is at the university level. In an actual university classroom, the Ebichu members' scholastic ability test unfolds. According to the members' predictions, Hoshina is the smartest and Kashiwagi is the stupidest, but what is the actual academic ability? A series of unimaginable rare answers. Who will be able to enter Ebisu Private University? And there's also a new development in the Ebichu game project!
