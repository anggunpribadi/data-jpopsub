1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Ebichu Tastas has started!

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:10,000
This week's Ebichu Tastas is Ebichu
Tastas University!

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:29,000
The answer to the miracle of the test
cannot be stopped! Ebichu Tastas starts!

4
00:00:44,410 --> 00:00:49,410
This is the first time I've ever seen a
video of a girl being attacked by a
monster.

5
00:00:49,410 --> 00:00:54,410
It was a little scary, but I was happy
to see it.

6
00:00:54,410 --> 00:00:59,410
This is the first time I've ever seen a
girl being attacked by a monster.

7
00:00:59,410 --> 00:01:04,410
It was a little scary, but I was happy
to see it.

8
00:01:04,410 --> 00:01:07,410
I tried to get a lot of stuff out of
private Ebisu Middle School.

9
00:01:07,410 --> 00:01:12,410
I tried to get a lot of stuff out of
private Ebisu Middle School.

10
00:01:12,410 --> 00:01:12,496
I tried to get a lot of stuff out of
private Ebisu Middle School.

11
00:01:12,496 --> 00:01:16,496
This program is brought to you by the
following sponsors.

12
00:01:26,576 --> 00:01:29,576
Bichuu Tastas has started!

13
00:01:31,576 --> 00:01:35,576
If we don't do it properly, the staff
will get mad at us.

14
00:01:35,576 --> 00:01:38,576
Let's do our best together!

15
00:01:39,576 --> 00:01:41,576
What? They got mad at you?

16
00:01:41,576 --> 00:01:42,576
Really?

17
00:01:42,576 --> 00:01:47,576
They said that I was too free during the
BBQ and it was boring.

18
00:01:47,576 --> 00:01:49,576
They said that?

19
00:01:49,576 --> 00:01:50,576
Really?

20
00:01:50,576 --> 00:01:53,576
When the principal said that, I was
pretty mad.

21
00:01:53,576 --> 00:01:54,576
The principal got mad at you?

22
00:01:54,576 --> 00:01:57,576
They said that I should do it properly
from now on.

23
00:01:57,576 --> 00:01:59,576
I see.

24
00:01:59,576 --> 00:02:00,576
Sorry, we are late.

25
00:02:00,576 --> 00:02:03,576
Hello, we are Takiwe and Chue from
Nagareboshi.

26
00:02:03,576 --> 00:02:08,576
It's summer, it's summer, it's summer,
I'm sorry.

27
00:02:08,576 --> 00:02:13,936
Thank you for watching!

28
00:02:13,936 --> 00:02:15,936
Please subscribe to our channel!

29
00:02:16,320 --> 00:02:20,320
Chuu-san went to our live show and
bought it by herself

30
00:02:20,320 --> 00:02:22,320
Takiyama-san?

31
00:02:22,320 --> 00:02:25,320
Everyone is like that

32
00:02:25,320 --> 00:02:27,320
No, no, no, that's fine

33
00:02:27,320 --> 00:02:29,320
It's weird that I bought it

34
00:02:29,320 --> 00:02:31,320
It's like an open-air hell

35
00:02:31,320 --> 00:02:32,320
It's like an open-air hell

36
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:34,320
If you don't buy it, it's like this

37
00:02:34,320 --> 00:02:36,320
I was surprised to see the live show

38
00:02:36,320 --> 00:02:39,320
Mayama's jump was amazing

39
00:02:39,320 --> 00:02:41,320
Jumping

40
00:02:41,320 --> 00:02:43,320
Show me that

41
00:02:43,320 --> 00:02:44,320
Now?

42
00:02:44,320 --> 00:02:45,320
Of course

43
00:02:45,320 --> 00:02:46,320
1,2,3

44
00:02:50,320 --> 00:02:52,320
I haven't done it yet

45
00:02:52,320 --> 00:02:54,320
I'll do it

46
00:02:54,320 --> 00:02:56,320
Let's see Takiyama's

47
00:02:56,320 --> 00:02:57,320
I want to see

48
00:02:57,320 --> 00:02:59,320
You should do it yourself

49
00:02:59,320 --> 00:03:01,320
I'm really hard

50
00:03:01,320 --> 00:03:02,320
1,2,3

51
00:03:07,320 --> 00:03:09,320
It was beyond my imagination

52
00:03:09,320 --> 00:03:12,320
How much did I fall behind?

53
00:03:12,320 --> 00:03:16,320
Please tell us about today's theme

54
00:03:16,320 --> 00:03:19,320
Today's theme is university

55
00:03:19,320 --> 00:03:28,240
We will show you the real university

56
00:03:28,240 --> 00:03:35,240
This time, we will visit the real
university and add university to the
shrimp

57
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
Why do you go to university today?

58
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:43,000
Because I am a junior high school
student forever, I don't have a chance
to be a university student

59
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,000
That's right, you are a junior high
school student forever

60
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:50,000
So I want to experience university only
today

61
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:57,000
So, the eternal junior high school
student Ebichu experienced university
only for a day

62
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:00,000
She went to the classroom immediately

63
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:03,000
Everyone is a real classroom, how is it?

64
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:07,000
It's different from what I imagined

65
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,000
It's like a classroom of a school bus

66
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:13,000
The floor and the environment are
different

67
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,000
The wall is also different

68
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,000
It's a mess

69
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:21,000
It's time, everyone, get in line

70
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,000
Why?

71
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,000
Get in line

72
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:28,000
Get in line, we will start the class

73
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:34,000
The class is about to start

74
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:42,000
So, we will have the entrance exam of
the Ebisu University

75
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
No way

76
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:49,000
This time, the theme is university

77
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:52,000
So, everyone, please answer the question

78
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
I can't

79
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:59,000
Don't stand up with your hands up

80
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:05,000
By the way, 5 of 8 students passed the
exam

81
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,000
What?

82
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,000
Please stand up

83
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:13,000
And the one who passed the exam is this

84
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:17,000
The special student, the university
student, Sakai

85
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:24,000
The class is about to start, 5 students
passed the exam

86
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:28,000
Everyone loves the celebration of
passing the exam

87
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,000
There is a punishment game

88
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:34,394
I thought there was no punishment game

89
00:05:34,394 --> 00:05:37,394
If you move Tastas a little bit, it will
be a little bit

90
00:05:39,394 --> 00:05:40,394
No, I don't know

91
00:05:40,394 --> 00:05:43,394
I said it randomly and she came back
unexpectedly

92
00:05:43,394 --> 00:05:47,394
By the way, who is the most intelligent
one in Ebichu?

93
00:05:47,394 --> 00:05:48,394
Hoshino

94
00:05:48,394 --> 00:05:50,394
Everyone is Hoshino

95
00:05:50,394 --> 00:05:51,394
Hoshino

96
00:05:51,394 --> 00:05:52,394
Really?

97
00:05:53,394 --> 00:05:57,394
I know difficult words in daily life

98
00:05:57,394 --> 00:05:58,394
Really?

99
00:05:58,394 --> 00:06:04,394
If you can't read in the script, Mirei
can read

100
00:06:04,394 --> 00:06:07,394
By the way, who is the most stupid one
in here?

101
00:06:07,394 --> 00:06:09,394
Even though you have bad grades

102
00:06:09,394 --> 00:06:11,394
She raised her hand

103
00:06:11,394 --> 00:06:12,394
That's amazing

104
00:06:12,394 --> 00:06:15,394
She is the most rampaging in the street

105
00:06:15,394 --> 00:06:17,394
This is the most popular

106
00:06:17,394 --> 00:06:21,394
If you study, you can do it, but if you
don't want to do it

107
00:06:21,394 --> 00:06:24,304
You can't study

108
00:06:24,304 --> 00:06:27,322
because there is a limit to what you can
do and can only be done by the
individual who陽レ 깜 Unlike google, thevet
in this car is selected as Well done

109
00:06:27,322 --> 00:06:29,322
Wow!

110
00:06:29,322 --> 00:06:30,322
Wait a minute, me?

111
00:06:30,322 --> 00:06:33,322
Are you here for the test of Shiri-su
Ebisu University?

112
00:06:33,322 --> 00:06:34,322
Yes

113
00:06:34,322 --> 00:06:35,322
No, no

114
00:06:35,322 --> 00:06:36,322
Do you want to take the test?

115
00:06:36,322 --> 00:06:37,322
No, not here

116
00:06:37,322 --> 00:06:39,322
No, no

117
00:06:39,322 --> 00:06:40,322
No, no

118
00:06:40,322 --> 00:06:42,322
I studied all night yesterday

119
00:06:42,322 --> 00:06:44,322
That's why your eyes are so red

120
00:06:44,322 --> 00:06:46,322
I have a bloodshot eye

121
00:06:46,322 --> 00:06:47,322
I see

122
00:06:47,322 --> 00:06:53,322
For some reason, Kaichi Ogata, who was
the first to have a school disaster,
also participated in the entrance exam
for the Ebi University

123
00:06:53,322 --> 00:06:59,322
So, we will now have the entrance exam
for Shiri-su Ebisu University

124
00:06:59,322 --> 00:07:00,322
Yes

125
00:07:00,322 --> 00:07:04,322
The first subject of the entrance exam
is Japanese

126
00:07:04,322 --> 00:07:06,322
The first question

127
00:07:06,322 --> 00:07:07,322
Please

128
00:07:07,322 --> 00:07:08,322
Go

129
00:07:08,322 --> 00:07:11,322
Fill in the blank and complete the word

130
00:07:11,322 --> 00:07:15,322
What is the word for cute girl?

131
00:07:15,322 --> 00:07:16,322
What is the word for cute girl?

132
00:07:16,322 --> 00:07:17,322
It's cute girl

133
00:07:17,322 --> 00:07:19,322
This is a good question

134
00:07:19,322 --> 00:07:21,322
Yes, it's a good question

135
00:07:21,322 --> 00:07:23,322
I want to go wild

136
00:07:23,322 --> 00:07:24,322
What is the word for cute girl?

137
00:07:24,322 --> 00:07:26,322
What was the word for sender?

138
00:07:26,322 --> 00:07:27,322
Sender?

139
00:07:27,322 --> 00:07:29,322
Sender?

140
00:07:29,322 --> 00:07:30,322
Sender?

141
00:07:30,322 --> 00:07:31,322
Takayama, Kageda

142
00:07:31,322 --> 00:07:33,322
What?

143
00:07:33,322 --> 00:07:34,322
What?

144
00:07:34,322 --> 00:07:35,322
What?

145
00:07:35,322 --> 00:07:37,322
What does that mean?

146
00:07:37,322 --> 00:07:39,322
There is only one answer

147
00:07:39,322 --> 00:07:42,322
Now, let's announce the answer

148
00:07:42,322 --> 00:07:45,322
First, Kaichi

149
00:07:45,322 --> 00:07:46,322
This is

150
00:07:46,322 --> 00:07:47,322
I will let the cute girl go on a trip

151
00:07:47,322 --> 00:07:48,322
Oh, you will let her go on a trip

152
00:07:48,322 --> 00:07:49,322
I will go from Hirota

153
00:07:49,322 --> 00:07:50,322
Yes

154
00:07:50,322 --> 00:07:51,322
Please

155
00:07:51,322 --> 00:07:54,322
I will let the cute girl go on a trip

156
00:07:54,322 --> 00:07:56,464
I see

157
00:07:56,464 --> 00:08:00,464
Next, Mayama, Hoshina, Yasumoto are
correct

158
00:08:01,328 --> 00:08:06,328
Then, Matsuno's answer who was worried
about the last question

159
00:08:06,328 --> 00:08:07,328
Matsuno is

160
00:08:10,328 --> 00:08:11,328
What?

161
00:08:11,328 --> 00:08:12,328
Oh, that's what it is

162
00:08:12,328 --> 00:08:14,328
I see, I see

163
00:08:14,328 --> 00:08:16,328
It's like whether B will be included or
not

164
00:08:16,328 --> 00:08:21,328
And, Kashiwagi's answer who declared
himself as a fool is

165
00:08:22,328 --> 00:08:23,328
Yes, Kashiwagi

166
00:08:24,328 --> 00:08:25,328
Let's go on a trip

167
00:08:25,328 --> 00:08:26,328
That's good

168
00:08:26,328 --> 00:08:28,328
That's right, let's go to Kyoto

169
00:08:28,328 --> 00:08:29,328
That's right, let's go on a trip

170
00:08:29,328 --> 00:08:31,328
Let's go to Nakayama

171
00:08:31,328 --> 00:08:35,328
Nakayama, to a cute girl, a good girl, a
good girl

172
00:08:37,328 --> 00:08:39,328
To a cute girl, a good girl, a good girl

173
00:08:39,328 --> 00:08:41,328
That's right

174
00:08:41,328 --> 00:08:43,328
You will do it to a cute girl, right?

175
00:08:43,328 --> 00:08:46,328
I will do it, but I thought there was no
answer

176
00:08:46,328 --> 00:08:47,328
It's under the line

177
00:08:47,328 --> 00:08:49,328
It's under the line?

178
00:08:49,328 --> 00:08:51,328
The answer is under the line

179
00:08:51,328 --> 00:08:54,328
Nakayama's answer, to a cute girl, a
good girl, a good girl

180
00:08:54,328 --> 00:08:56,328
It's the truth

181
00:08:56,328 --> 00:08:59,328
I see, and Kobayashi, the last one,
please

182
00:08:59,328 --> 00:09:02,328
To a cute girl, bungee jump

183
00:09:03,328 --> 00:09:04,328
What does it mean?

184
00:09:04,328 --> 00:09:05,328
What does it mean?

185
00:09:06,328 --> 00:09:08,328
I don't know

186
00:09:09,328 --> 00:09:12,328
It's a question that has been around for
a long time, why is it a katakana
answer?

187
00:09:12,328 --> 00:09:13,328
That's right

188
00:09:13,328 --> 00:09:15,328
Bungee jump to a cute girl

189
00:09:15,328 --> 00:09:17,328
The second question

190
00:09:18,328 --> 00:09:20,328
Next is also a question of this
technique

191
00:09:20,328 --> 00:09:21,328
Jump

192
00:09:21,328 --> 00:09:23,328
O-nyarara is sleeping and waiting

193
00:09:23,328 --> 00:09:25,328
I've heard of it

194
00:09:25,328 --> 00:09:26,328
What is it?

195
00:09:26,328 --> 00:09:28,328
It's like a fantasy

196
00:09:28,328 --> 00:09:30,328
What does it mean?

197
00:09:31,328 --> 00:09:33,328
Now, the answer announcement

198
00:09:35,328 --> 00:09:37,328
Okada-san, please

199
00:09:37,328 --> 00:09:38,328
Yes

200
00:09:38,328 --> 00:09:40,328
Kaho is sleeping and waiting

201
00:09:40,328 --> 00:09:42,328
Okada-san is correct

202
00:09:42,328 --> 00:09:45,328
Hoshina just screamed

203
00:09:45,328 --> 00:09:47,328
Let's see Hoshina

204
00:09:47,328 --> 00:09:48,328
Please

205
00:09:49,328 --> 00:09:51,328
Negoto is sleeping and waiting

206
00:09:51,328 --> 00:09:52,328
That's right

207
00:09:52,328 --> 00:09:54,328
It's not a sleep talk

208
00:09:54,328 --> 00:09:57,328
As expected, Negoto is the smartest one

209
00:09:57,328 --> 00:09:58,328
I'm done

210
00:09:58,328 --> 00:10:00,328
What are you waiting for?

211
00:10:00,328 --> 00:10:02,328
I'm writing an A

212
00:10:02,328 --> 00:10:03,328
Curry rice

213
00:10:03,328 --> 00:10:05,328
Please calm down

214
00:10:05,328 --> 00:10:07,328
What does it mean?

215
00:10:07,328 --> 00:10:12,328
Curry rice is better to put it in the
fridge than the first one

216
00:10:12,328 --> 00:10:14,328
It's better to let it sleep

217
00:10:14,328 --> 00:10:15,328
That's what it means

218
00:10:15,328 --> 00:10:17,328
It's better to let curry rice sleep

219
00:10:17,328 --> 00:10:20,328
It's better to let curry rice sleep

220
00:10:20,328 --> 00:10:21,328
As expected

221
00:10:21,328 --> 00:10:25,312
I'm done

222
00:10:25,312 --> 00:10:27,312
So let's see Hirota's

223
00:10:27,312 --> 00:10:29,312
Pickled vegetables

224
00:10:29,312 --> 00:10:31,312
I think it's good

225
00:10:31,312 --> 00:10:33,312
It's good to have a special combination

226
00:10:33,312 --> 00:10:35,312
It's good to have pickled vegetables

227
00:10:35,312 --> 00:10:37,312
It's good because the taste is soaked

228
00:10:39,312 --> 00:10:41,312
I can eat oden

229
00:10:41,312 --> 00:10:43,312
Oden is also delicious

230
00:10:43,312 --> 00:10:45,312
It's not like that

231
00:10:45,312 --> 00:10:47,312
It's completely a food thing

232
00:10:47,312 --> 00:10:49,312
Kobayashi

233
00:10:49,312 --> 00:10:51,312
Let's go to Kobayashi

234
00:10:51,312 --> 00:10:53,312
Kobayashi, please

235
00:10:53,312 --> 00:10:55,312
It's not Seino

236
00:10:55,312 --> 00:10:57,312
I heard Kobayashi

237
00:10:57,312 --> 00:10:59,312
It's in order

238
00:10:59,312 --> 00:11:01,312
What?

239
00:11:01,312 --> 00:11:03,312
Santa

240
00:11:03,312 --> 00:11:05,312
Santa is sleeping

241
00:11:05,312 --> 00:11:07,312
And

242
00:11:07,312 --> 00:11:12,000
It's not correct with Yasumoto

243
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:16,000
Next is the science question

244
00:11:16,656 --> 00:11:18,656
This one

245
00:11:21,656 --> 00:11:24,656
Of course drawing a frog is correct

246
00:11:24,656 --> 00:11:26,656
But what is the member's drawing?

247
00:11:27,656 --> 00:11:29,656
It's disgusting

248
00:11:29,656 --> 00:11:31,656
It's disgusting

249
00:11:31,656 --> 00:11:32,656
Who drew it?

250
00:11:32,656 --> 00:11:33,656
Can I draw bad?

251
00:11:33,656 --> 00:11:34,656
Please be quiet

252
00:11:34,656 --> 00:11:36,656
Everyone, did you draw it?

253
00:11:36,656 --> 00:11:38,656
Let's see

254
00:11:38,656 --> 00:11:40,656
I was surprised

255
00:11:40,656 --> 00:11:42,656
Kobayashi

256
00:11:42,656 --> 00:11:46,656
Please show us

257
00:11:46,656 --> 00:11:48,656
You are good at drawing

258
00:11:48,656 --> 00:11:49,656
Frog

259
00:11:49,656 --> 00:11:51,656
You have a good sense

260
00:11:52,656 --> 00:11:55,656
Ogata, Mayama, Nakayama

261
00:11:55,656 --> 00:11:59,440
Hirota is good at drawing

262
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:06,440
And what do these two people think of
their drawings?

263
00:12:08,272 --> 00:12:11,272
Yes, yes, yes, the legs are growing

264
00:12:11,272 --> 00:12:13,272
Yes, yes, yes, the legs are growing

265
00:12:13,272 --> 00:12:14,272
And the next one

266
00:12:17,272 --> 00:12:18,272
What, what, what?

267
00:12:18,272 --> 00:12:19,272
What is this?

268
00:12:19,272 --> 00:12:21,272
What is that?

269
00:12:21,272 --> 00:12:22,272
That is a living thing

270
00:12:22,272 --> 00:12:23,272
It grows, right?

271
00:12:23,272 --> 00:12:24,272
It grows, right?

272
00:12:24,272 --> 00:12:25,272
Because it says ゲロゲロ

273
00:12:25,272 --> 00:12:27,272
I thought I didn't understand it, so I
wrote ゲロゲロ

274
00:12:27,272 --> 00:12:30,272
And I was wondering what to draw on the
body

275
00:12:30,272 --> 00:12:32,272
It's a little gross

276
00:12:32,272 --> 00:12:33,272
It's super gross

277
00:12:33,272 --> 00:12:35,272
It's like a push and pull

278
00:12:35,272 --> 00:12:36,272
Yasumoto

279
00:12:36,272 --> 00:12:38,272
Yasumoto

280
00:12:38,272 --> 00:12:42,272
After this, Yasumoto's painting is
revealed

281
00:12:42,272 --> 00:12:47,872
And there is an unbelievable living
thing

282
00:12:47,872 --> 00:12:53,872
The members are drawing the picture of
the frog at the entrance exam that
started suddenly

283
00:12:54,872 --> 00:12:56,872
Next is Yasumoto's answer

284
00:12:57,872 --> 00:12:59,872
I have a frog

285
00:13:05,872 --> 00:13:06,872
What is this?

286
00:13:06,872 --> 00:13:08,872
This is Otama-Jakushi

287
00:13:08,872 --> 00:13:09,872
Otama-Jakushi

288
00:13:09,872 --> 00:13:12,872
First of all, the frog's head

289
00:13:12,872 --> 00:13:17,872
It's like a frog's skin

290
00:13:17,872 --> 00:13:21,872
I think it's a frog's body

291
00:13:21,872 --> 00:13:23,872
Otama-Jakushi's legs are growing

292
00:13:23,872 --> 00:13:24,872
It's a frog's body

293
00:13:24,872 --> 00:13:28,872
It's like a film

294
00:13:28,872 --> 00:13:32,872
I've never seen the frog's body in the
middle of the picture

295
00:13:33,872 --> 00:13:36,872
I've never seen it

296
00:13:36,872 --> 00:13:39,872
Next is Kashiwagi

297
00:13:39,872 --> 00:13:42,872
Please show us

298
00:13:42,872 --> 00:13:44,872
Is this a parasite?

299
00:13:44,872 --> 00:13:46,872
It's so scary

300
00:13:46,872 --> 00:13:47,872
What is this?

301
00:13:47,872 --> 00:13:49,872
What's going on?

302
00:13:49,872 --> 00:13:51,872
What is this?

303
00:13:51,872 --> 00:13:56,872
I still don't know what a cat-boy's eyes
and mouth are

304
00:13:56,872 --> 00:13:58,872
What is this?

305
00:13:58,872 --> 00:13:59,872
It's like a tail

306
00:13:59,872 --> 00:14:01,872
I don't know. I think it's better to
grow up

307
00:14:01,872 --> 00:14:03,872
I don't know if it's better to grow up

308
00:14:03,872 --> 00:14:05,872
There is no frog

309
00:14:05,872 --> 00:14:08,872
The score so far is here

310
00:14:08,872 --> 00:14:11,872
The blue member is not qualified

311
00:14:11,872 --> 00:14:14,872
Will it be a reversal?

312
00:14:15,872 --> 00:14:18,872
The last subject is society

313
00:14:18,872 --> 00:14:22,320
The last subject is society

314
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:30,320
The famous phrase that Gagarin said when
he went to the space flight for the
first time in the world

315
00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:33,320
The earth is ________

316
00:14:33,320 --> 00:14:35,320
You like Nakayama, don't you?

317
00:14:35,320 --> 00:14:37,320
I like it. There are two

318
00:14:37,320 --> 00:14:39,320
There are two

319
00:14:39,320 --> 00:14:41,320
There are two

320
00:14:41,320 --> 00:14:43,320
There are two

321
00:14:43,320 --> 00:14:45,320
There are two

322
00:14:45,320 --> 00:14:47,320
I got it

323
00:14:47,320 --> 00:14:49,320
There is one

324
00:14:49,320 --> 00:14:53,320
Now, let's announce the answer

325
00:14:53,552 --> 00:14:55,552
How about Kaichi?

326
00:14:55,552 --> 00:14:57,552
It was wrong

327
00:14:57,552 --> 00:14:59,552
It's correct

328
00:14:59,552 --> 00:15:04,552
Mayama and Hoshina were a bit close, but
these 4 were correct

329
00:15:04,552 --> 00:15:06,552
I got it

330
00:15:06,552 --> 00:15:10,552
And Hirota who was confused with 2
answers

331
00:15:10,552 --> 00:15:12,552
Marui and Kaito

332
00:15:12,552 --> 00:15:16,224
Both were incorrect

333
00:15:16,224 --> 00:15:23,224
While everyone was wondering whether the
Earth is round or blue, what was
Kobayashi's answer?

334
00:15:24,224 --> 00:15:25,224
The Earth moves

335
00:15:25,224 --> 00:15:26,224
It moves?

336
00:15:26,224 --> 00:15:27,224
The Earth moves

337
00:15:27,224 --> 00:15:29,224
It's like a song by Laputa

338
00:15:30,224 --> 00:15:31,224
Furthermore

339
00:15:32,224 --> 00:15:33,224
Yasumoto

340
00:15:33,224 --> 00:15:36,224
The Earth is everyone's mother

341
00:15:38,224 --> 00:15:39,224
That's good

342
00:15:39,224 --> 00:15:42,224
The Earth is everyone's mother

343
00:15:42,224 --> 00:15:44,224
It's a famous saying

344
00:15:44,224 --> 00:15:46,224
It's a famous saying

345
00:15:46,224 --> 00:15:49,648
The second question from the society

346
00:15:49,648 --> 00:15:51,648
Here is the question

347
00:15:52,648 --> 00:15:56,648
She is Napoleon, Napoleon's wife, what
did he say?

348
00:15:56,648 --> 00:15:59,648
He said 〇〇

349
00:16:00,648 --> 00:16:02,648
Is this a little cool?

350
00:16:02,648 --> 00:16:04,648
Cool

351
00:16:04,648 --> 00:16:06,648
A little cool?

352
00:16:06,648 --> 00:16:08,648
I think it's cool

353
00:16:08,648 --> 00:16:13,248
Then the answer announcement

354
00:16:13,248 --> 00:16:15,248
Hoshina

355
00:16:15,248 --> 00:16:17,248
Hoshina's easy answer

356
00:16:17,248 --> 00:16:19,248
It's a famous famous phrase

357
00:16:19,248 --> 00:16:21,248
So these 5 people also got the correct
answer

358
00:16:23,248 --> 00:16:25,248
Kashiwagi and Nakayama also got the
wrong answer

359
00:16:25,248 --> 00:16:30,064
But it's a very close answer

360
00:16:30,064 --> 00:16:34,064
Meanwhile, Yasumoto has a shocking
answer

361
00:16:35,064 --> 00:16:36,064
Yasumoto

362
00:16:37,064 --> 00:16:38,064
Really?

363
00:16:39,064 --> 00:16:40,064
Cool

364
00:16:43,064 --> 00:16:44,064
It's a temple

365
00:16:44,064 --> 00:16:46,064
A, you are handsome

366
00:16:47,064 --> 00:16:49,064
It's a real temple

367
00:16:49,064 --> 00:16:51,064
It's very cool

368
00:16:51,064 --> 00:16:53,064
It's not written in any dictionary

369
00:16:54,064 --> 00:16:55,064
Cool

370
00:16:55,064 --> 00:16:58,064
Finally, the final question

371
00:16:58,064 --> 00:17:00,064
The answer is...

372
00:17:00,256 --> 00:17:03,256
The third question is from Edison

373
00:17:03,256 --> 00:17:06,256
It's in the lyrics of the song

374
00:17:06,256 --> 00:17:07,256
Really?

375
00:17:07,256 --> 00:17:08,256
Is it?

376
00:17:08,256 --> 00:17:09,256
It is

377
00:17:10,256 --> 00:17:11,256
Let's see

378
00:17:11,256 --> 00:17:16,016
Let's see the answer

379
00:17:16,016 --> 00:17:18,016
Let's start with Hiroto. What is it?

380
00:17:18,016 --> 00:17:20,016
Effort

381
00:17:20,016 --> 00:17:22,016
I see. Mayama, go

382
00:17:22,016 --> 00:17:24,016
Effort

383
00:17:24,016 --> 00:17:26,016
Effort

384
00:17:26,016 --> 00:17:28,016
Effort

385
00:17:28,016 --> 00:17:30,016
Let's see the answer

386
00:17:30,016 --> 00:17:32,016
Ability

387
00:17:32,016 --> 00:17:34,016
99% ability

388
00:17:34,016 --> 00:17:37,016
And Ogata is correct too

389
00:17:37,016 --> 00:17:41,016
Yasumoto Kobayashi is unfortunately
incorrect

390
00:17:41,016 --> 00:17:47,016
Nakayama, go. 1% of Tenzara, and 99% of
Hirameki

391
00:17:47,016 --> 00:17:50,752
Thank you for watching

392
00:17:50,752 --> 00:17:52,752
Cute cute

393
00:17:52,752 --> 00:17:54,752
It's like a girl manga's textbook

394
00:17:54,752 --> 00:17:55,752
It's cute

395
00:17:55,752 --> 00:17:57,752
It's sparkling and throbbing

396
00:17:57,752 --> 00:17:58,752
It's true

397
00:17:59,752 --> 00:18:02,752
The shrimp university entrance exam is
over

398
00:18:02,752 --> 00:18:04,752
Who passed the exam?

399
00:18:04,752 --> 00:18:06,752
But before that

400
00:18:07,752 --> 00:18:11,752
Shrimp Chuu Game Quest

401
00:18:11,752 --> 00:18:18,752
The game project is currently in
progress

402
00:18:19,648 --> 00:18:23,648
The members who tested the demo version
of the game last time

403
00:18:23,648 --> 00:18:31,728
This time, we decided to think about the
characters that appear in the game

404
00:18:31,728 --> 00:18:33,728
I like this one

405
00:18:33,728 --> 00:18:35,728
What should I do?

406
00:18:35,728 --> 00:18:37,728
Okay, I'm done

407
00:18:37,728 --> 00:18:39,728
What should I do?

408
00:18:39,728 --> 00:18:40,728
Are you okay?

409
00:18:40,728 --> 00:18:41,728
Yes

410
00:18:42,728 --> 00:18:44,728
What is the character that Mayama
thought of?

411
00:18:44,728 --> 00:18:47,728
This is the character that I thought of

412
00:18:48,728 --> 00:18:50,728
It's a middle school student who is
active

413
00:18:52,728 --> 00:18:54,728
What is this?

414
00:18:54,728 --> 00:18:56,728
This is the background

415
00:18:56,728 --> 00:19:03,728
The background is that Yasumoto-san
wanted an old man

416
00:19:03,728 --> 00:19:06,728
So, he is standing in front of the door

417
00:19:06,728 --> 00:19:08,728
to make an old man appear

418
00:19:09,728 --> 00:19:11,728
This little one is an old man

419
00:19:11,728 --> 00:19:13,728
It's good

420
00:19:13,728 --> 00:19:16,728
Next, what is the character that
Yasumoto thought of?

421
00:19:19,728 --> 00:19:21,728
The name of this character is

422
00:19:21,728 --> 00:19:24,728
Crispy Fried Potato

423
00:19:24,728 --> 00:19:26,728
It's a potato

424
00:19:27,728 --> 00:19:30,728
There are a fried potato and a potato's
face

425
00:19:30,728 --> 00:19:32,728
One by one

426
00:19:32,728 --> 00:19:36,728
Among them, the first member is the
shrimp-chew member

427
00:19:36,728 --> 00:19:39,728
It's fun to be with everyone

428
00:19:39,728 --> 00:19:43,728
It's like a popping EDC

429
00:19:46,728 --> 00:19:49,728
Next, what is the character that
Kobayashi thought of?

430
00:19:49,728 --> 00:19:51,728
This is the character

431
00:19:51,728 --> 00:19:54,728
It's cute

432
00:19:54,728 --> 00:19:58,728
This is the principal

433
00:19:58,728 --> 00:20:01,728
He is wearing a shrimp

434
00:20:01,728 --> 00:20:03,728
What should I call him?

435
00:20:03,728 --> 00:20:05,728
What about Ebi-sensei?

436
00:20:05,728 --> 00:20:07,728
Then, Ebi-sensei

437
00:20:08,728 --> 00:20:11,728
Next, what is the character that Matsuno
thought of?

438
00:20:11,728 --> 00:20:12,728
Please announce it

439
00:20:12,728 --> 00:20:15,728
The name is Ebi-maru-chan

440
00:20:16,728 --> 00:20:18,728
When does it appear?

441
00:20:18,728 --> 00:20:23,728
It's a person who helps you when you are
in danger

442
00:20:23,728 --> 00:20:26,728
It depends on the level

443
00:20:26,728 --> 00:20:28,728
The top one is the shrimp

444
00:20:28,728 --> 00:20:32,728
Shrimp has a great skill

445
00:20:32,728 --> 00:20:34,728
It has a rank

446
00:20:35,728 --> 00:20:36,728
I see

447
00:20:36,728 --> 00:20:39,728
This is good

448
00:20:40,728 --> 00:20:43,728
I will take the idea I received to the
company

449
00:20:43,728 --> 00:20:45,728
and consider it

450
00:20:45,728 --> 00:20:50,728
Will the members' opinions be accepted?

451
00:20:50,728 --> 00:20:52,728
Ebi-chew Game Project

452
00:20:52,728 --> 00:20:58,192
Please look forward to the next
development

453
00:20:58,192 --> 00:21:03,192
The interesting answer is the end of the
shrimp university entrance exam

454
00:21:03,192 --> 00:21:07,952
Who is the pass?

455
00:21:07,952 --> 00:21:11,952
Now, I'd like to announce the pass

456
00:21:11,952 --> 00:21:14,952
The first one is

457
00:21:15,952 --> 00:21:17,952
Congratulations, Ogata-san

458
00:21:17,952 --> 00:21:19,952
I knew it

459
00:21:19,952 --> 00:21:24,952
By the way, Ogata-san got all the
questions right

460
00:21:25,952 --> 00:21:27,952
The campus life you've been longing for

461
00:21:28,952 --> 00:21:30,952
Congratulations

462
00:21:31,952 --> 00:21:34,952
Next, the 2nd place in the same class

463
00:21:34,952 --> 00:21:36,952
Who is the pass?

464
00:21:36,952 --> 00:21:38,952
Hoshina

465
00:21:38,952 --> 00:21:41,680
Congratulations

466
00:21:41,680 --> 00:21:43,680
The winner is Mayama

467
00:21:43,680 --> 00:21:45,680
Congratulations

468
00:21:45,680 --> 00:21:47,680
Yay

469
00:21:47,680 --> 00:21:51,680
The next winner is

470
00:21:54,680 --> 00:21:56,680
The winner is Hirota

471
00:21:56,680 --> 00:21:59,344
Congratulations

472
00:21:59,344 --> 00:22:01,344
There is one more person left

473
00:22:01,344 --> 00:22:05,344
By the way, who do you think is going to
win?

474
00:22:05,344 --> 00:22:09,344
Everyone is raising their hands

475
00:22:09,344 --> 00:22:12,344
You don't have to raise your hands

476
00:22:12,344 --> 00:22:16,344
Masuno and Nakayama are raising their
hands twice

477
00:22:16,344 --> 00:22:18,344
What will happen?

478
00:22:18,344 --> 00:22:20,344
I will announce the winner

479
00:22:20,344 --> 00:22:27,264
Who will be the last one to slip?

480
00:22:27,264 --> 00:22:30,264
Matsuho, congratulations!

481
00:22:30,264 --> 00:22:43,770
Matsuho, congratulations!

482
00:22:43,770 --> 00:22:46,770
We are now in the private Ebisu
University!

483
00:22:47,770 --> 00:22:49,770
And so...

484
00:22:49,770 --> 00:22:52,770
Hello everyone!

485
00:22:52,770 --> 00:22:55,770
Hello!

486
00:22:55,770 --> 00:23:01,770
It's the morning time and we are in the
private Ebisu University!

487
00:23:01,770 --> 00:23:03,770
There's a lot of people here!

488
00:23:03,770 --> 00:23:05,770
There's a lot of people here!

489
00:23:05,770 --> 00:23:07,770
We are all here!

490
00:23:07,770 --> 00:23:13,770
The five people who pass will receive a
prize of a university potato!

491
00:23:15,840 --> 00:23:20,840
On the other hand, the four people who
failed were these four people

492
00:23:20,840 --> 00:23:28,840
The most stupid among the four is
Yasumoto, Nakayama, Kashiwagi, or
Kobayashi

493
00:23:28,840 --> 00:23:33,840
The one who was the loser was Kashiwagi!

494
00:23:33,840 --> 00:23:36,840
Yay!

495
00:23:36,840 --> 00:23:38,840
Yay!

496
00:23:38,840 --> 00:23:40,840
How is it, Kashiwagi?

497
00:23:40,840 --> 00:23:45,840
I'm very frustrated

498
00:23:45,840 --> 00:23:53,840
So, Kashiwagi at the bottom will have a
smart-looking face to say something

499
00:23:53,840 --> 00:23:59,840
Then, please say something smart with a
stupid face

500
00:23:59,840 --> 00:24:06,840
Can you do it? I can't

501
00:24:06,840 --> 00:24:08,840
Thank you very much

502
00:24:08,840 --> 00:24:12,840
You have a good face

503
00:24:14,720 --> 00:24:18,720
So, what is Ebichu plus University?

504
00:24:20,016 --> 00:24:22,016
Can you do it?

505
00:24:22,016 --> 00:24:25,016
I can't do it

506
00:24:25,016 --> 00:24:31,016
Kashiyagi was a junior high school
student with a long history of studying

507
00:24:31,016 --> 00:24:36,016
Next time, Ebichu plus University's
second half

508
00:24:36,016 --> 00:24:40,016
I'm so nervous, I'm going to have an
interview

509
00:24:41,016 --> 00:24:44,016
The interviewer is too scary, Nakayama

510
00:24:44,016 --> 00:24:46,016
Wait a minute

511
00:24:46,016 --> 00:24:48,016
I don't want to do it anymore

512
00:24:48,016 --> 00:24:51,016
Here is the announcement

513
00:24:51,016 --> 00:24:58,016
Kashiyagi Hinata's main movie, No Show,
is going to be released from July 25th

514
00:24:58,016 --> 00:25:00,016
It's so colorful

515
00:25:00,016 --> 00:25:02,016
Don't miss it

516
00:25:02,016 --> 00:25:08,016
In addition, Kashiyagi Hinata's first
photo book will be released

517
00:25:08,016 --> 00:25:13,016
And if you missed Ebichu plus
University, you will get a notice

518
00:25:13,016 --> 00:25:19,016
The movie will be released on the movie
streaming site Stardust Channel

519
00:25:24,016 --> 00:25:29,016
You can watch the movie at any time

520
00:25:29,016 --> 00:25:35,016
And there will be a lot of unsealed
videos

521
00:25:35,016 --> 00:25:39,152
Search for the movie on Stardust Channel

522
00:25:39,152 --> 00:25:47,152
This program was sponsored by the
sponsor.

523
00:25:47,152 --> 00:25:51,152
Welcome to Geki Odoika Cafe!

524
00:25:51,152 --> 00:25:53,152
Welcome to Tokimeki Cafe!

525
00:25:53,152 --> 00:25:55,152
Oh!

526
00:25:55,152 --> 00:26:00,970
I'm the owner, so I'll take off my
clothes when I wear them.
