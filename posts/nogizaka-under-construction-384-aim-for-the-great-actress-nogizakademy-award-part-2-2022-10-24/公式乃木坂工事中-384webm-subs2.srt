1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,000
Nogizaka is back!

2
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:13,696
Everyone, the great actress, Nogizaka
Demi-chan!

3
00:00:13,696 --> 00:00:22,696
Nogizaka 46 will challenge various
projects to be able to handle any kind
of acting work in the future.

4
00:00:23,696 --> 00:00:28,696
First, they will act according to the
set announced at the scene.

5
00:00:28,696 --> 00:00:30,696
From the one phrase contest.

6
00:00:30,696 --> 00:00:32,696
I will change the lines.

7
00:00:32,696 --> 00:00:34,696
I will say, good morning.

8
00:00:34,696 --> 00:00:37,696
Is there such a thing? There are many
good morning.

9
00:00:37,696 --> 00:00:42,696
After listening to the setting, they
will act immediately. Tonight's top
batter is Endo.

10
00:00:43,696 --> 00:00:46,696
Endo, you are doing various things,
aren't you?

11
00:00:46,696 --> 00:00:48,696
No, but it's not much.

12
00:00:48,696 --> 00:00:56,336
Compared to the old Endo, it was
really...

13
00:00:56,336 --> 00:00:58,842
Ha ha!

14
00:00:58,842 --> 00:01:01,842
It was like this, but now it's
properly...

15
00:01:02,842 --> 00:01:05,842
What? There's no good one?

16
00:01:05,842 --> 00:01:07,842
It's a weird Endo.

17
00:01:07,842 --> 00:01:09,842
Well, let's go.

18
00:01:09,842 --> 00:01:10,842
Here's the situation.

19
00:01:10,842 --> 00:01:16,842
To the senior who is interested in club
activities, there are a lot of love
words.

20
00:01:16,842 --> 00:01:17,842
I want you to decide this.

21
00:01:17,842 --> 00:01:21,842
This is why the feeling of love is
overflowing.

22
00:01:21,842 --> 00:01:23,842
Senior who is interested in club
activities.

23
00:01:23,842 --> 00:01:25,842
I don't know.

24
00:01:25,842 --> 00:01:29,842
Let's go.

25
00:01:31,842 --> 00:01:33,842
Good morning.

26
00:01:33,842 --> 00:01:38,842
Good.

27
00:01:38,842 --> 00:01:42,842
It's a serious love word.

28
00:01:42,842 --> 00:01:44,842
Now it's a love word of Endo.

29
00:01:44,842 --> 00:01:46,842
It's a love word of Endo.

30
00:01:46,842 --> 00:01:47,842
I like it the most.

31
00:01:47,842 --> 00:01:48,842
I imagined it.

32
00:01:48,842 --> 00:01:58,842
It was difficult for me to express a lot
of love words, so I just said good
morning and tried hard, but it became a
little small.

33
00:01:58,842 --> 00:02:00,842
Great.

34
00:02:00,842 --> 00:02:06,752
Next, the setting of the fifth
generation of Ichino Semikun is...

35
00:02:06,752 --> 00:02:13,292
I arrived at the classroom late at
night, but I was told to be late for
class.

36
00:02:13,292 --> 00:02:15,292
It's difficult.

37
00:02:15,292 --> 00:02:18,292
I thought I was in time.

38
00:02:18,292 --> 00:02:20,292
I was told to be late for class.

39
00:02:20,292 --> 00:02:22,292
I see.

40
00:02:22,292 --> 00:02:32,314
Good morning, Ichino Semikun.

41
00:02:32,314 --> 00:02:34,314
I'm sorry university

42
00:02:40,762 --> 00:02:43,762
But what happened when I first ran?

43
00:02:43,762 --> 00:02:45,762
I was in a hurry

44
00:02:45,762 --> 00:02:46,762
You were in a hurry

45
00:02:46,762 --> 00:02:48,762
I wanted to run away

46
00:02:48,762 --> 00:02:50,762
It's like Steve Williams

47
00:02:50,762 --> 00:02:53,762
But you were pretty angry

48
00:02:53,762 --> 00:02:56,762
I was pretty angry when I was a student

49
00:02:56,762 --> 00:02:58,762
Oh, I see

50
00:02:58,762 --> 00:03:00,762
That's good

51
00:03:00,762 --> 00:03:05,808
Next is Asadora actress Yamashita's
challenge

52
00:03:05,808 --> 00:03:07,808
I'm nervous

53
00:03:07,808 --> 00:03:11,808
I think Asadora actresses say good
morning

54
00:03:11,808 --> 00:03:13,808
I'm from Kansai

55
00:03:13,808 --> 00:03:15,808
I say good morning

56
00:03:17,808 --> 00:03:19,808
Yamashita's good morning

57
00:03:19,808 --> 00:03:23,808
This is a sleepover prank

58
00:03:23,808 --> 00:03:27,808
It's a young comedian's good morning in
the opening

59
00:03:27,808 --> 00:03:29,808
Why?

60
00:03:29,808 --> 00:03:31,808
Do you know what a sleepover prank is?

61
00:03:31,808 --> 00:03:35,808
It's a room where an idol like Nobizaka
stays

62
00:03:35,808 --> 00:03:37,808
Izyri is good at it

63
00:03:37,808 --> 00:03:43,808
I'm not going to say it in a loud voice

64
00:03:43,808 --> 00:03:47,808
But she's excited in the opening

65
00:03:47,808 --> 00:03:52,808
I didn't expect Asadora actresses to do
this

66
00:03:52,808 --> 00:03:59,808
Let's go

67
00:03:59,808 --> 00:04:01,808
Good morning

68
00:04:06,808 --> 00:04:08,808
Why can you do it?

69
00:04:08,808 --> 00:04:09,808
Did you get it?

70
00:04:09,808 --> 00:04:12,808
You did well

71
00:04:13,808 --> 00:04:15,808
You were a good young lady

72
00:04:15,808 --> 00:04:17,808
You were very detailed

73
00:04:18,808 --> 00:04:20,808
I'll put it in tomorrow

74
00:04:20,808 --> 00:04:22,808
That's great

75
00:04:22,808 --> 00:04:25,808
You can do it without knowing

76
00:04:25,808 --> 00:04:27,808
One phrase challenge

77
00:04:27,808 --> 00:04:29,808
Next is Onii-chan

78
00:04:30,808 --> 00:04:31,808
Onii-chan?

79
00:04:31,808 --> 00:04:32,808
I'll do Onii-chan

80
00:04:32,808 --> 00:04:37,808
The first phrase challenge is

81
00:04:37,808 --> 00:04:42,808
When your favorite brother does a boring
prank

82
00:04:42,808 --> 00:04:46,808
I'll do a straight Onii-chan

83
00:04:46,808 --> 00:04:54,448
Onii-chan from Akanishi

84
00:04:54,448 --> 00:04:56,448
Onii-chan

85
00:04:58,448 --> 00:04:59,448
I see

86
00:04:59,448 --> 00:05:03,448
It's real and the setting is higher than
I thought

87
00:05:03,448 --> 00:05:04,448
I see

88
00:05:04,448 --> 00:05:06,448
When I was playing games, I did
something

89
00:05:06,448 --> 00:05:07,448
What did you do?

90
00:05:07,448 --> 00:05:09,448
I put on gum

91
00:05:09,448 --> 00:05:11,448
It's the worst

92
00:05:11,448 --> 00:05:12,448
It's the worst

93
00:05:12,448 --> 00:05:14,448
On your hair?

94
00:05:14,448 --> 00:05:15,448
I'm sorry

95
00:05:15,448 --> 00:05:17,448
Onii-chan

96
00:05:17,448 --> 00:05:19,448
Wait, gum is dangerous

97
00:05:19,448 --> 00:05:21,448
I have to cut it

98
00:05:21,448 --> 00:05:24,448
You can do it, you can chew gum

99
00:05:25,448 --> 00:05:29,448
Next, Okuda Iroha will challenge Onii-
chan

100
00:05:29,448 --> 00:05:31,448
Okuda, do you have siblings?

101
00:05:31,448 --> 00:05:33,448
I have an older brother and a younger
brother

102
00:05:33,448 --> 00:05:35,448
You don't have an older brother

103
00:05:35,448 --> 00:05:37,448
Here is the situation

104
00:05:38,448 --> 00:05:41,448
Onii-chan who met his first brother

105
00:05:41,448 --> 00:05:43,448
Good

106
00:05:43,448 --> 00:05:46,448
I thought you didn't have an older
brother, but you did

107
00:05:46,448 --> 00:05:47,448
I see

108
00:05:47,448 --> 00:05:51,448
You know you have a brother, right?

109
00:05:51,448 --> 00:05:58,624
Let's do our best

110
00:05:58,624 --> 00:06:00,624
Onii-chan?

111
00:06:03,624 --> 00:06:05,624
Oh, it's the real tension version

112
00:06:05,624 --> 00:06:07,624
I thought so too

113
00:06:07,624 --> 00:06:09,624
I see

114
00:06:09,624 --> 00:06:11,624
Onii-chan?

115
00:06:13,624 --> 00:06:15,624
You held it down

116
00:06:15,624 --> 00:06:17,624
You're good

117
00:06:18,624 --> 00:06:22,624
Next, the 3rd generation, Sato Kaede's
acting skills

118
00:06:22,624 --> 00:06:24,624
How was it? Did you have any acting
experience?

119
00:06:24,624 --> 00:06:26,624
No, not at all

120
00:06:26,624 --> 00:06:28,624
Why are you so nervous?

121
00:06:28,624 --> 00:06:30,624
I'm not

122
00:06:30,624 --> 00:06:32,624
It's hard, isn't it?

123
00:06:32,624 --> 00:06:34,624
I think I'm wrong

124
00:06:34,624 --> 00:06:36,624
No, it's not

125
00:06:36,624 --> 00:06:38,624
I don't know, maybe Kunoichi's role will
come

126
00:06:38,624 --> 00:06:40,624
Then

127
00:06:40,624 --> 00:06:42,624
It's tough

128
00:06:42,624 --> 00:06:44,624
This is the situation

129
00:06:44,624 --> 00:06:46,624
5 years old girl

130
00:06:46,624 --> 00:06:50,624
is looking for her brother who was
playing

131
00:06:50,624 --> 00:06:52,624
I see

132
00:06:52,624 --> 00:06:54,624
She's 5 years old

133
00:06:54,624 --> 00:06:56,624
She's been acting for 10 years

134
00:06:56,624 --> 00:06:58,624
The last one

135
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:06,960
Big brother!

136
00:07:11,930 --> 00:07:13,930
Oh, she's coming out.

137
00:07:13,930 --> 00:07:15,930
Oh, no.

138
00:07:15,930 --> 00:07:17,930
Oh, no.

139
00:07:17,930 --> 00:07:19,930
My voice is a little hoarse.

140
00:07:19,930 --> 00:07:21,930
You're right.

141
00:07:21,930 --> 00:07:24,930
I thought I could be a voice actor, but
I forgot my voice.

142
00:07:24,930 --> 00:07:27,930
It's a little difficult.

143
00:07:27,930 --> 00:07:29,930
It's difficult.

144
00:07:29,930 --> 00:07:31,930
I'm alone.

145
00:07:31,930 --> 00:07:33,930
I don't want to hear that excuse.

146
00:07:33,930 --> 00:07:35,930
There's no one here.

147
00:07:35,930 --> 00:07:37,728
Thank you for watching.

148
00:07:37,728 --> 00:07:40,728
It's really low.

149
00:07:40,728 --> 00:07:44,728
It's a little lower than the first
AKIMOTO.

150
00:07:44,728 --> 00:07:47,728
Is that so?

151
00:07:47,728 --> 00:07:50,728
Change the line again.

152
00:07:50,728 --> 00:07:52,728
It's a yes.

153
00:07:52,728 --> 00:07:54,728
Yes?

154
00:07:54,728 --> 00:07:56,728
It's a good one.

155
00:07:56,728 --> 00:07:58,728
A word to his grandmother.

156
00:07:58,728 --> 00:08:01,728
This topic is challenged by Tomisato.

157
00:08:01,728 --> 00:08:04,728
The line is short.

158
00:08:04,728 --> 00:08:07,728
Yes.

159
00:08:07,728 --> 00:08:10,728
The situation of yes is...

160
00:08:10,728 --> 00:08:15,728
The first yes of the phone number.

161
00:08:15,728 --> 00:08:20,728
It's a yes.

162
00:08:20,728 --> 00:08:22,728
Yes.

163
00:08:22,728 --> 00:08:25,728
I only said yes.

164
00:08:25,728 --> 00:08:33,872
Tomisato's yes.

165
00:08:33,872 --> 00:08:34,872
Yes.

166
00:08:36,872 --> 00:08:37,872
Yes, that's right.

167
00:08:37,872 --> 00:08:39,872
It's a bit like a horror movie.

168
00:08:39,872 --> 00:08:42,872
There are a lot of young girls in horror
movies.

169
00:08:42,872 --> 00:08:43,872
Yes.

170
00:08:43,872 --> 00:08:44,872
It's like that.

171
00:08:44,872 --> 00:08:45,872
She has a good expression.

172
00:08:45,872 --> 00:08:46,872
Yes, it's good.

173
00:08:47,872 --> 00:08:51,872
Next, the yes that Ioki will challenge.

174
00:08:51,872 --> 00:08:58,872
Yes when you give a present to a senior
who you are interested in.

175
00:08:58,872 --> 00:09:02,872
To a senior who you are interested in.

176
00:09:02,872 --> 00:09:03,872
Yes.

177
00:09:03,872 --> 00:09:04,872
It's a good thing.

178
00:09:04,872 --> 00:09:06,872
But you are interested in it.

179
00:09:06,872 --> 00:09:07,872
Yes.

180
00:09:07,872 --> 00:09:08,872
You like it.

181
00:09:08,872 --> 00:09:09,872
Let's go.

182
00:09:09,872 --> 00:09:16,096
3, 2, 1, action.

183
00:09:16,096 --> 00:09:17,076
Yes.

184
00:09:21,264 --> 00:09:24,264
It was a bit of a mess.

185
00:09:24,264 --> 00:09:26,264
It was a mess.

186
00:09:26,264 --> 00:09:28,264
I was so emotional.

187
00:09:28,264 --> 00:09:30,264
I was so emotional.

188
00:09:30,264 --> 00:09:33,264
I was so touched that I thought I liked
her.

189
00:09:33,264 --> 00:09:35,264
It was a great feeling.

190
00:09:36,264 --> 00:09:40,264
Next, Iwamoto's story.

191
00:09:40,264 --> 00:09:43,264
He was asked to go out with someone he
liked.

192
00:09:43,264 --> 00:09:45,264
He was asked to go out with someone he
liked.

193
00:09:45,264 --> 00:09:47,264
He replied with a lot of joy.

194
00:09:47,264 --> 00:09:49,264
This is a good story.

195
00:09:49,264 --> 00:09:51,264
It's a straight story.

196
00:09:51,264 --> 00:09:53,264
It's difficult.

197
00:09:53,264 --> 00:10:00,720
Please watch again.

198
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:01,720
Yes.

199
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:03,720
That's good!

200
00:10:03,720 --> 00:10:05,720
That's good!

201
00:10:05,720 --> 00:10:08,922
That's good!

202
00:10:08,922 --> 00:10:10,922
She is good.

203
00:10:10,922 --> 00:10:12,922
She is a good person.

204
00:10:12,922 --> 00:10:14,922
She is laughing.

205
00:10:14,922 --> 00:10:16,922
She is embarrassed.

206
00:10:16,922 --> 00:10:19,922
Do you make videos with your feelings?

207
00:10:19,922 --> 00:10:22,922
I focus on the camera.

208
00:10:22,922 --> 00:10:24,922
That's great.

209
00:10:24,922 --> 00:10:26,922
That's good.

210
00:10:26,922 --> 00:10:29,922
Hibura-san, do you want to do an
exhibition?

211
00:10:29,922 --> 00:10:31,922
Me?

212
00:10:31,922 --> 00:10:36,922
So, the exhibition is held by Hibura-
PRO.

213
00:10:36,922 --> 00:10:39,922
I thought you were going to pee.

214
00:10:39,922 --> 00:10:42,922
I thought you were going to pee.

215
00:10:42,922 --> 00:10:46,922
I thought you were going to pee.

216
00:10:46,922 --> 00:10:49,922
I thought you were going to pee.

217
00:10:49,922 --> 00:10:51,922
Is that okay?

218
00:10:51,922 --> 00:11:04,922
Hibura-san, please.

219
00:11:05,434 --> 00:11:08,434
Yes.

220
00:11:08,434 --> 00:11:11,434
Good.

221
00:11:11,434 --> 00:11:13,434
You are a good person.

222
00:11:13,434 --> 00:11:16,434
I feel sorry for her.

223
00:11:16,434 --> 00:11:19,434
She is a person who is told to be a bad
person.

224
00:11:19,434 --> 00:11:21,434
Yes.

225
00:11:21,434 --> 00:11:23,434
Why am I the only one who loses?

226
00:11:23,434 --> 00:11:25,434
Do you remember this?

227
00:11:25,434 --> 00:11:27,434
I remember clearly.

228
00:11:27,434 --> 00:11:29,434
It's been very popular on the Internet.

229
00:11:29,434 --> 00:11:31,434
Really?

230
00:11:31,434 --> 00:11:32,448
Yes.

231
00:11:32,448 --> 00:11:36,448
From now on, we will continue to the
last episode.

232
00:11:36,448 --> 00:11:40,448
What kind of acting will you do if you
are given various situations in the sea?

233
00:11:40,448 --> 00:11:44,448
Check out the members' ad-lib acting
skills.

234
00:11:45,448 --> 00:11:46,448
The first topic is,

235
00:11:46,448 --> 00:11:50,448
I'm irritated by myself who can't convey
my feelings to my favorite person,

236
00:11:50,448 --> 00:11:52,448
I say a word in the sea.

237
00:11:53,448 --> 00:11:57,448
The 5th generation Okamoto Hina will
challenge this acting.

238
00:11:57,448 --> 00:11:59,448
The last episode

239
00:11:59,448 --> 00:12:02,448
I couldn't say it all the time, but...

240
00:12:03,386 --> 00:12:05,386
I love you!

241
00:12:05,386 --> 00:12:07,386
That's good

242
00:12:08,386 --> 00:12:12,386
Next, Gokusei Sugawara will challenge
this sad topic

243
00:12:14,386 --> 00:12:18,386
I want to spend this winter with my
seniors

244
00:12:21,386 --> 00:12:23,386
Why can't I say it?

245
00:12:23,386 --> 00:12:28,912
Idiot!

246
00:12:28,912 --> 00:12:32,912
I think you should be more active in
your acting job.

247
00:12:32,912 --> 00:12:34,912
You're a fool.

248
00:12:34,912 --> 00:12:38,912
What does 15-year-old Ogawa think?

249
00:12:40,912 --> 00:12:43,912
What does it mean to be like a little
sister?

250
00:12:43,912 --> 00:12:45,912
Cute!

251
00:12:45,912 --> 00:12:51,296
customers are

252
00:12:51,296 --> 00:12:53,296
Ike Da Teresa

253
00:12:53,296 --> 00:12:55,296
Ike Da Teresa is coming

254
00:12:55,296 --> 00:12:57,296
What is that?

255
00:12:57,296 --> 00:12:59,296
What is that?

256
00:13:03,296 --> 00:13:05,296
Stupid

257
00:13:05,296 --> 00:13:08,848
It's 10 o'clock

258
00:13:08,848 --> 00:13:11,848
Why don't you believe that you like me?

259
00:13:11,848 --> 00:13:12,848
I don't believe it

260
00:13:12,848 --> 00:13:15,848
Why don't you tell me that you like me?

261
00:13:15,848 --> 00:13:17,848
My idiot

262
00:13:17,848 --> 00:13:18,848
Good

263
00:13:18,848 --> 00:13:20,848
It's a peaceful woman

264
00:13:20,848 --> 00:13:24,848
Next, Hayashi Luna who continues to
continue the tricky play

265
00:13:27,848 --> 00:13:29,848
I like you

266
00:13:29,848 --> 00:13:32,928
I like you very much

267
00:13:32,928 --> 00:13:34,928
I can't say it anymore

268
00:13:38,928 --> 00:13:40,928
It's like a reality show

269
00:13:40,928 --> 00:13:42,928
Let's do it again

270
00:13:45,928 --> 00:13:47,928
I love you

271
00:13:51,928 --> 00:13:53,928
I can't say it

272
00:13:53,928 --> 00:13:59,928
Next is the ad-lib performance of Yumiki

273
00:14:00,512 --> 00:14:03,752
Yumiki wants to perform at the beach

274
00:14:03,752 --> 00:14:13,338
He smacks his forehead until the last
minute to challenge the edge weakness of
the eyes

275
00:14:13,338 --> 00:14:15,338
Oh my god!

276
00:14:15,338 --> 00:14:17,338
Oh my god!

277
00:14:17,338 --> 00:14:19,338
I got it!

278
00:14:19,338 --> 00:14:23,338
The staff members are all wet with tears
due to the high tide.

279
00:14:23,338 --> 00:14:25,338
The next topic is...

280
00:14:25,338 --> 00:14:33,338
I got 10 billion yen in the lottery, but
I came to the sea without telling
anyone.

281
00:14:33,338 --> 00:14:35,338
Let's go to Hawaii!

282
00:14:35,338 --> 00:14:39,338
I'm going to use my money!

283
00:14:39,338 --> 00:14:42,338
First of all, 500 million yen is from my
savings!

284
00:14:42,338 --> 00:14:42,432
I'm going to use my money!

285
00:14:42,432 --> 00:14:47,432
ーA lot of members who scream about how
to use moneyー

286
00:14:47,432 --> 00:14:53,432
ーThe acting that shows the style of the
actressー

287
00:14:53,432 --> 00:14:58,432
ーIs she aware of it?ー

288
00:14:58,432 --> 00:15:01,432
ーNo way! Really?ー

289
00:15:01,432 --> 00:15:05,432
ーNo, really!ー

290
00:15:05,432 --> 00:15:08,432
ーI did it!ー

291
00:15:08,432 --> 00:15:11,962
ーI'm so glad!ー

292
00:15:11,962 --> 00:15:14,962
I can save my mom with this.

293
00:15:14,962 --> 00:15:16,962
I won.

294
00:15:20,962 --> 00:15:21,962
What?

295
00:15:21,962 --> 00:15:23,962
It costs 10 billion yen.

296
00:15:26,962 --> 00:15:27,962
This is dangerous.

297
00:15:27,962 --> 00:15:28,962
This is interesting.

298
00:15:28,962 --> 00:15:31,808
This is dangerous.

299
00:15:31,808 --> 00:15:33,808
Ending?

300
00:15:33,808 --> 00:15:35,808
What is this?

301
00:15:37,808 --> 00:15:39,808
The next topic is

302
00:15:39,808 --> 00:15:44,808
How many seconds do you spend on your
precious memories?

303
00:15:44,808 --> 00:15:49,808
Before you forget your loved one, come
to the sea and say a word.

304
00:15:50,808 --> 00:15:53,808
The person who will challenge this
challenge is the singing mermaid,
NAKANISHI.

305
00:15:53,808 --> 00:15:55,808
This is strange.

306
00:15:55,808 --> 00:16:00,768
No matter how many memories you have,

307
00:16:00,768 --> 00:16:02,768
I love you.

308
00:16:02,768 --> 00:16:04,768
That's good.

309
00:16:04,768 --> 00:16:06,768
So it's okay.

310
00:16:07,768 --> 00:16:12,768
I will also love you tomorrow.

311
00:16:12,768 --> 00:16:14,768
That's good.

312
00:16:14,768 --> 00:16:15,768
That's good.

313
00:16:15,768 --> 00:16:17,768
Something is coming.

314
00:16:17,768 --> 00:16:22,768
Next is the 3rd generation of
heavyweight play, Nakamura Rena.

315
00:16:22,768 --> 00:16:30,768
I want to tell you how much I loved you
and how much I was happy.

316
00:16:31,296 --> 00:16:33,796
I'll forget it tomorrow.

317
00:16:36,796 --> 00:16:37,796
No!

318
00:16:38,796 --> 00:16:40,796
I don't want this!

319
00:16:42,796 --> 00:16:44,796
Yeah, it's real.

320
00:16:47,796 --> 00:16:48,796
That's amazing.

321
00:16:48,796 --> 00:16:51,296
They're doing a stage performance.

322
00:16:51,296 --> 00:16:52,296
I've never...

323
00:16:52,796 --> 00:16:53,796
You can go in properly.

324
00:16:53,796 --> 00:16:55,296
Thank you so much!

325
00:16:55,296 --> 00:17:01,296
I agree.

326
00:17:02,010 --> 00:17:07,010
I'm sure I'll cry if I laugh.

327
00:17:07,010 --> 00:17:09,010
I'm crying.

328
00:17:09,010 --> 00:17:11,010
Really.

329
00:17:11,010 --> 00:17:13,010
I'm crying.

330
00:17:13,010 --> 00:17:15,010
I'm crying.

331
00:17:15,010 --> 00:17:20,010
If I really lost my memory,

332
00:17:20,010 --> 00:17:29,010
I would be sad if I thought I would
forget my family and members.

333
00:17:29,010 --> 00:17:31,904
That's right.

334
00:17:31,904 --> 00:17:33,904
NAKAMURA and ITO are amazing.

335
00:17:33,904 --> 00:17:39,904
ITO and LILIA are living in a tragic
world.

336
00:17:39,904 --> 00:17:34,244
I'm a little bit of a

337
00:17:34,244 --> 00:17:39,904
I'm a little bit of a

338
00:17:39,904 --> 00:17:41,904
YUMIKI.

339
00:17:41,904 --> 00:17:42,904
Please listen to me.

340
00:17:42,904 --> 00:17:47,904
I was in the same group as NAKAMURA and
ITO and LILIA.

341
00:17:47,904 --> 00:17:51,904
I'm the type of group that enters.

342
00:17:51,904 --> 00:17:54,904
I thought I'd say a word to the sea and
end it.

343
00:17:54,904 --> 00:17:58,904
The two of them are back very late.

344
00:17:58,904 --> 00:18:00,904
I have to do something.

345
00:18:00,904 --> 00:18:05,904
I'm not sure if LILIA is a dangle.

346
00:18:09,904 --> 00:18:16,904
From here on, I will check if I can act
naturally in a setting that cuts daily
life into super pinpoints.

347
00:18:16,904 --> 00:18:19,904
What is the first topic of the night?

348
00:18:19,904 --> 00:18:31,904
It's a facial expression play where a
message is confessed to the smartphone
and a response is accepted.

349
00:18:31,904 --> 00:18:37,904
I'm glad I got a reply that I waited
for.

350
00:18:37,904 --> 00:18:40,904
How to show just with a face

351
00:18:40,904 --> 00:18:42,904
Asatora Yamashita challenges

352
00:18:42,904 --> 00:18:44,904
I'm going to start.

353
00:18:44,904 --> 00:18:48,442
Thank you for your viewing.

354
00:18:48,442 --> 00:18:54,262
Did I send him a message?

355
00:18:54,262 --> 00:19:04,262
Thank you for watching.

356
00:19:04,378 --> 00:19:06,378
He just told me he's here.

357
00:19:06,378 --> 00:19:07,378
I see.

358
00:19:09,378 --> 00:19:10,378
He's already here.

359
00:19:11,378 --> 00:19:12,378
Oh, not yet.

360
00:19:12,378 --> 00:19:22,490
What?

361
00:19:22,490 --> 00:19:24,490
Thank you!

362
00:19:24,490 --> 00:19:26,490
Good job!

363
00:19:26,490 --> 00:19:28,490
You're good!

364
00:19:28,490 --> 00:19:29,824
Thank you!

365
00:19:29,824 --> 00:19:31,824
You're good at this.

366
00:19:31,824 --> 00:19:33,824
As expected of Asadore.

367
00:19:33,824 --> 00:19:35,824
Asadore?

368
00:19:35,824 --> 00:19:37,824
Asadore?

369
00:19:37,824 --> 00:19:39,824
Can I call you Asadore?

370
00:19:41,824 --> 00:19:43,824
That was good.

371
00:19:43,824 --> 00:19:45,824
You're really good.

372
00:19:45,824 --> 00:19:47,824
I'm nervous.

373
00:19:47,824 --> 00:19:49,824
You're not nervous at all.

374
00:19:49,824 --> 00:19:53,824
I was nervous when Asadore auditioned.

375
00:19:53,824 --> 00:19:55,824
I'm glad you're not nervous.

376
00:19:55,824 --> 00:19:57,824
Why did this happen?

377
00:19:57,824 --> 00:19:59,824
Why did this happen?

378
00:19:59,824 --> 00:20:01,444
automatic

379
00:20:01,444 --> 00:20:02,432
Thank you for watching!

380
00:20:02,432 --> 00:20:05,432
The next pin point is

381
00:20:05,432 --> 00:20:11,432
The expression of eating a hamburger
that exceeds the concept so far

382
00:20:11,432 --> 00:20:13,432
Expression acting

383
00:20:13,432 --> 00:20:16,432
So it's so delicious that it's
impossible

384
00:20:18,432 --> 00:20:21,432
Ioki challenges difficult expression
acting

385
00:20:21,432 --> 00:20:23,432
Ioki can go? Ioki will go

386
00:20:23,432 --> 00:20:25,432
Ready start

387
00:20:25,432 --> 00:20:29,432
Today I came to the famous hamburger
shop

388
00:20:29,432 --> 00:20:32,432
I would like to eat immediately

389
00:20:32,432 --> 00:20:36,768
Adding!

390
00:20:36,768 --> 00:20:38,768
This is...

391
00:20:38,768 --> 00:20:40,560
Umayuki!

392
00:20:40,560 --> 00:20:42,560
Wait a minute.

393
00:20:42,560 --> 00:20:43,560
Wait a minute.

394
00:20:43,560 --> 00:20:46,560
This is an act.

395
00:20:47,560 --> 00:20:49,560
It started with a food report.

396
00:20:49,560 --> 00:20:51,560
I thought it was an act that was doing a
food report.

397
00:20:51,560 --> 00:20:53,560
I thought it was a drama like that.

398
00:20:53,560 --> 00:20:56,560
You don't say Umayuki in dramas or
movies.

399
00:20:56,560 --> 00:20:58,560
It comes out when it's delicious.

400
00:20:58,560 --> 00:20:59,560
Umayuki.

401
00:20:59,560 --> 00:21:02,560
Can I get Umayuki again?

402
00:21:02,560 --> 00:21:03,560
Umayuki!

403
00:21:03,560 --> 00:21:05,560
Thank you very much.

404
00:21:05,560 --> 00:21:07,560
It's cute.

405
00:21:07,560 --> 00:21:10,560
The next act is...

406
00:21:11,560 --> 00:21:14,560
It's an act where you call the clerk by
ringing your finger coolly.

407
00:21:14,560 --> 00:21:16,560
It's cute.

408
00:21:16,560 --> 00:21:18,560
There are such things.

409
00:21:18,560 --> 00:21:19,560
It's a role of a cool woman.

410
00:21:19,560 --> 00:21:21,560
If this is decided coolly.

411
00:21:21,560 --> 00:21:22,560
That's right.

412
00:21:22,560 --> 00:21:24,560
Sato will challenge this act.

413
00:21:24,560 --> 00:21:26,560
Will it be revenge?

414
00:21:26,560 --> 00:21:28,560
Sato has changed.

415
00:21:28,560 --> 00:21:30,560
This block is dangerous.

416
00:21:30,560 --> 00:21:32,560
Please.

417
00:21:32,560 --> 00:21:33,560
Let's start.

418
00:21:33,560 --> 00:21:37,560
Ready, start!

419
00:21:39,930 --> 00:21:41,930
Please give me a fillet.

420
00:21:45,930 --> 00:21:46,930
What is that?

421
00:21:46,930 --> 00:21:47,930
Is it a philhonic?

422
00:21:47,930 --> 00:21:49,930
Please give me a fillet.

423
00:21:49,930 --> 00:21:50,930
What is that?

424
00:21:50,930 --> 00:21:51,930
It's a one-word phrase.

425
00:21:51,930 --> 00:21:53,930
What is that?

426
00:21:53,930 --> 00:21:54,930
Please give me a fillet.

427
00:21:54,930 --> 00:21:57,930
What did you say?

428
00:21:57,930 --> 00:21:59,930
Please give me a fillet.

429
00:21:59,930 --> 00:22:01,930
I think it's cool.

430
00:22:01,930 --> 00:22:04,930
You suddenly called the staff and said,
please give me a fillet.

431
00:22:04,930 --> 00:22:06,930
Suddenly.

432
00:22:06,930 --> 00:22:09,930
It's a foreign setting.

433
00:22:09,930 --> 00:22:12,930
The sound is cool.

434
00:22:12,930 --> 00:22:16,930
The intonation of your speech is like a
philhonic.

435
00:22:16,930 --> 00:22:18,930
It's like that when you talk.

436
00:22:18,930 --> 00:22:20,930
You put a robot in it.

437
00:22:20,930 --> 00:22:22,930
No, I put a foreigner in it.

438
00:22:22,930 --> 00:22:25,552
Foreigners?

439
00:22:25,552 --> 00:22:29,552
So, this is the last time Higuchi is in
Nogizaka.

440
00:22:29,552 --> 00:22:30,552
I'm lonely.

441
00:22:30,552 --> 00:22:31,552
I'm lonely.

442
00:22:31,552 --> 00:22:32,552
I'm lonely.

443
00:22:32,552 --> 00:22:33,552
Especially for a first-generation child.

444
00:22:33,552 --> 00:22:37,552
Higuchi may have had various conflicts.

445
00:22:37,552 --> 00:22:41,552
I think there were a lot of hard things.

446
00:22:41,552 --> 00:22:45,552
I'm happy to clean up.

447
00:22:45,552 --> 00:22:46,552
I'm glad.

448
00:22:46,552 --> 00:22:49,552
It was a fun Nogizaka life.

449
00:22:49,552 --> 00:22:52,552
I'm glad you helped me.

450
00:22:52,552 --> 00:22:54,552
You're like a color from the beginning.

451
00:22:54,552 --> 00:22:56,552
I'm glad.

452
00:22:56,552 --> 00:22:58,552
What is this?

453
00:22:58,552 --> 00:23:00,552
I'm proud of you.

454
00:23:00,552 --> 00:23:03,552
I'll prepare a room for you.

455
00:23:03,552 --> 00:23:06,552
I'm glad.

456
00:23:06,552 --> 00:23:09,552
Have you ever been left behind in this
program?

457
00:23:09,552 --> 00:23:15,552
At first, I was afraid of the scene.

458
00:23:15,552 --> 00:23:17,552
I was also very depressed.

459
00:23:17,552 --> 00:23:20,552
But Mr. Hananaman made it interesting.

460
00:23:20,552 --> 00:23:22,552
I thought it would be okay.

461
00:23:22,552 --> 00:23:28,552
I was happy to record every time.

462
00:23:28,552 --> 00:23:33,552
I think it was the best place to come
home.

463
00:23:33,552 --> 00:23:35,552
I'm glad you said that.

464
00:23:35,552 --> 00:23:39,552
Please send a message to the fans who
watched the program.

465
00:23:39,552 --> 00:23:40,552
Yes.

466
00:23:40,552 --> 00:23:42,552
Wow, amazing.

467
00:23:47,552 --> 00:23:50,552
Thank you so much.

468
00:23:50,552 --> 00:23:59,552
I was able to do my best for 11 years
because of the fans who liked me.

469
00:23:59,552 --> 00:24:04,552
Thank you for your warm support.

470
00:24:04,552 --> 00:24:07,552
Nogizaka will continue to grow.

471
00:24:07,552 --> 00:24:12,552
I will continue to watch this program
and support you.

472
00:24:12,552 --> 00:24:15,552
Thank you so much.

473
00:24:15,552 --> 00:24:18,552
See you again.

474
00:24:18,552 --> 00:24:20,552
Thank you.

475
00:24:20,552 --> 00:24:22,552
Congratulations on your graduation.

476
00:24:22,552 --> 00:24:24,552
I'm happy.

477
00:24:24,552 --> 00:24:27,552
Thank you.

478
00:24:27,552 --> 00:24:29,552
Do your best.

479
00:24:29,552 --> 00:24:31,552
Thank you.

480
00:24:31,552 --> 00:24:33,552
Congratulations on your graduation.

481
00:24:33,552 --> 00:24:36,922
Thank you.

482
00:24:36,922 --> 00:24:43,522
Nojisaka 46's 31st single will be
released on December 7th!

483
00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:48,400
Also, the online meet and greet event
for the release of the single will be
held!

484
00:24:49,400 --> 00:24:54,400
And next time, in Kouji, Nogizaka, the
31st single will be announced!

485
00:24:55,400 --> 00:24:59,400
Higuchi Hina's Sosugyo Ceremony, the
delivery ticket is on sale!

486
00:25:00,400 --> 00:25:01,400
I'm Higuchi Hina.

487
00:25:03,400 --> 00:25:05,400
Which one should I choose? This one?

488
00:25:05,400 --> 00:25:07,400
Oh, thank goodness.

489
00:25:07,400 --> 00:25:10,400
The member's bakuro episode.

490
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:17,400
Maaya wanted to eat a sesame seed, so
she bought it for the dog.

491
00:25:18,400 --> 00:25:21,400
That was Maaya's natural episode.

492
00:25:21,400 --> 00:25:22,400
I wonder if I can send it to her.

493
00:25:22,400 --> 00:25:24,400
I said this.

494
00:25:24,400 --> 00:25:26,400
It's okay. We're friends.

495
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:40,201
