09:34.634 --> 09:36.634
 Hey, I know!

09:36.634 --> 09:38.634
 What?

09:38.634 --> 09:40.634
 That's weird!

09:40.634 --> 09:42.634
 I don't know anything!

09:42.634 --> 09:44.634
 I know this one!

09:44.634 --> 09:46.634
 There are many words

09:46.634 --> 09:48.634
 and I should have memorized them

09:48.634 --> 09:50.634
 but I'm told to do this...

09:50.634 --> 09:51.984
 Transcribed by BlaZGcore

09:51.984 --> 09:53.984
 I'm not sure.

09:53.984 --> 09:54.984
 I'm not sure.

09:54.984 --> 09:55.984
 Can you speak Japanese?

09:55.984 --> 09:56.984
 Yes.

09:58.984 --> 09:59.984
 You're lying!

09:59.984 --> 10:01.984
 I understand everything.

10:01.984 --> 10:03.984
 Hobby.

10:03.984 --> 10:04.984
 Hobby.

10:04.984 --> 10:05.984
 Hobby.

10:05.984 --> 10:06.984
 Yes, it's a hobby.

10:06.984 --> 10:08.984
 I was wondering what it was.

10:08.984 --> 10:10.984
 It's not a hobby.

10:13.984 --> 10:16.984
 I should have studied English properly.

10:16.984 --> 10:18.984
 It's like the Olympics.

10:18.984 --> 10:21.984
 I don't understand English.

10:21.984 --> 10:23.984
 I don't understand English.

10:28.096 --> 10:31.096
 I want to make it a little good.

10:31.096 --> 10:33.096
 What is this?

10:33.096 --> 10:35.096
 What did you buy?

10:35.096 --> 10:38.096
 Kikuhuku, sesame dumplings and moon of
Hagen-Dazs.

10:38.096 --> 10:41.096
 I heard that sesame dumplings are
delicious.

10:41.096 --> 10:45.096
 So I bought it as a souvenir for the
first time.

10:45.096 --> 10:50.096
 I only buy frozen ones when I go home.

10:50.096 --> 10:53.096
 I bought a frozen one for the time
being.

10:53.096 --> 10:55.096
 Is it frozen?

10:55.096 --> 10:58.096
 It says 12 hours.

10:58.096 --> 11:03.096
 I can't help it. I can't eat it when I
don't have a day off.

11:08.602 --> 11:10.102
 Thank you so much.

11:15.642 --> 11:17.642
 How is it?

11:17.642 --> 11:19.642
 It's hot!

11:19.642 --> 11:21.642

11:27.642 --> 11:29.642
 Let's eat!

11:29.642 --> 11:31.130
 It's hot!

11:31.130 --> 11:33.130
 Good boy.

11:43.354 --> 11:45.354
 Is it good?

11:45.354 --> 11:47.354
 It was good.

11:49.354 --> 11:51.354

12:15.610 --> 12:16.610
 Sun?

12:17.610 --> 12:18.610
 Everyday?

12:19.610 --> 12:20.610
 Everyday?

12:20.610 --> 12:21.970
 Since 2006

12:25.610 --> 12:28.610
 We are acting in a Japanese собствен
style

12:28.610 --> 12:32.602
 If you're feeling down, come on, let's
go for a ride!

12:32.602 --> 12:37.602
 1, 2, 3, I can overcome anything

12:37.602 --> 12:43.602
 Go! To the future!

12:54.298 --> 12:58.298
 I end up thinking about it when I stop
