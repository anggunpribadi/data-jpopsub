1
00:00:03,008 --> 00:00:06,808
I guess Ebichu's tour is coming to an
end soon

2
00:00:06,808 --> 00:00:08,808
The tour should be going well

3
00:00:10,808 --> 00:00:12,808
Let's do a father quiz

4
00:00:15,808 --> 00:00:18,808
Please open your clothes

5
00:00:18,808 --> 00:00:20,808
Here it is

6
00:00:20,808 --> 00:00:22,808
It doesn't look like you

7
00:00:22,808 --> 00:00:24,808
It looks cooler

8
00:00:24,808 --> 00:00:26,808
Father quiz, the first question

9
00:00:26,808 --> 00:00:31,808
Mayama's father's favorite food is
sashimi and sake

10
00:00:31,808 --> 00:00:35,808
What is his favorite food and what did
he fry?

11
00:00:35,808 --> 00:00:37,808
Scallop

12
00:00:37,808 --> 00:00:40,808
I think he fried it with butter and soy
sauce

13
00:00:40,808 --> 00:00:41,808
Does he cook?

14
00:00:41,808 --> 00:00:44,808
Yes, he does. My dad and my dad cook on
Sundays

15
00:00:44,808 --> 00:00:47,808
The answer is scallop with scallop

16
00:00:47,808 --> 00:00:49,808
Wow, that's correct

17
00:00:49,808 --> 00:00:51,808
What's your dad's favorite food?

18
00:00:51,808 --> 00:00:54,808
I like pork belly, so my dad cooks it
for me

19
00:00:54,808 --> 00:00:56,808
That's good

20
00:00:56,808 --> 00:00:58,808
My dad cooks meat

21
00:00:58,808 --> 00:01:00,808
Why is your dad your dad?

22
00:01:00,808 --> 00:01:02,808
It's on TV

23
00:01:02,808 --> 00:01:04,808
If a 20 year old girl says her dad,

24
00:01:04,808 --> 00:01:07,808
she'll think she's not a good daughter

25
00:01:07,808 --> 00:01:09,568
I'm not a good daughter

26
00:01:09,828 --> 00:01:11,308
Please cut this part

27
00:01:11,308 --> 00:01:18,308
If your father was a member of Ebichu,
what would you do?

28
00:01:19,368 --> 00:01:20,368
Why?

29
00:01:20,368 --> 00:01:22,368
My mom doesn't do that

30
00:01:22,368 --> 00:01:25,368
I don't know, but my dad is a Kyushu boy

31
00:01:25,368 --> 00:01:27,368
So, I have a lot of blood type

32
00:01:28,368 --> 00:01:30,368
Of course, the correct answer is

33
00:01:30,368 --> 00:01:32,368
Gourmet report

34
00:01:32,368 --> 00:01:34,368
I do that a lot at home

35
00:01:34,368 --> 00:01:35,368
You do?

36
00:01:35,368 --> 00:01:36,368
I want to hear

37
00:01:36,368 --> 00:01:38,368
Today I made Mapo tofu

38
00:01:38,368 --> 00:01:40,368
How do you eat it?

39
00:01:40,368 --> 00:01:41,368
It's like, yes

40
00:01:41,368 --> 00:01:42,368
Yes

41
00:01:42,368 --> 00:01:44,368
Eat it and say something

42
00:01:44,368 --> 00:01:45,368
It's spicy

43
00:01:45,368 --> 00:01:47,368
You're close

44
00:01:47,368 --> 00:01:49,368
Say something to your dad

45
00:01:49,368 --> 00:01:51,368
Thank you

46
00:01:51,368 --> 00:01:53,368
Say it properly

47
00:01:53,368 --> 00:01:55,368
You say thank you a lot at home

48
00:01:55,368 --> 00:01:57,368
Dad, thank you

49
00:01:57,368 --> 00:01:58,592
Thank you

50
00:01:58,592 --> 00:02:00,496
Thank you for watching!

51
00:02:00,496 --> 00:02:02,496
Hello.

52
00:02:02,496 --> 00:02:04,496
Are you confident, Hoshina-san?

53
00:02:04,496 --> 00:02:08,496
I don't know. I don't know what I'm
thinking.

54
00:02:08,496 --> 00:02:11,496
Hoshina-san's drawing of her father,
open.

55
00:02:11,496 --> 00:02:13,496
Oh, it's similar.

56
00:02:13,496 --> 00:02:15,496
The first question of the father quiz.

57
00:02:15,496 --> 00:02:18,496
What do you want Mirei-chan to fix?

58
00:02:18,496 --> 00:02:19,496
The second place is,

59
00:02:19,496 --> 00:02:20,496
The second place is,

60
00:02:20,496 --> 00:02:22,496
By the way, the first place is,

61
00:02:22,496 --> 00:02:25,496
forgetting her cell phone at home or in
the car,

62
00:02:25,496 --> 00:02:26,496
and she is busy.

63
00:02:26,496 --> 00:02:27,496
The third place is,

64
00:02:27,496 --> 00:02:31,496
It takes time to decide on clothes, and
she has to change at least three times.

65
00:02:31,496 --> 00:02:32,496
What?

66
00:02:32,496 --> 00:02:33,496
That much?

67
00:02:33,496 --> 00:02:34,496
Three times?

68
00:02:34,496 --> 00:02:37,496
I really can't go out on a really bad
day.

69
00:02:37,496 --> 00:02:39,496
If I go out on a really bad day,

70
00:02:39,496 --> 00:02:41,496
it's a really bad day.

71
00:02:41,496 --> 00:02:42,496
No tension.

72
00:02:42,496 --> 00:02:46,336
Sleep once.

73
00:02:46,336 --> 00:02:47,568
Bao!

74
00:02:48,568 --> 00:02:52,568
I want to take a bath, but it's a hassle
to take a bath.

75
00:02:52,568 --> 00:02:54,568
But if I don't take a bath, I don't want
to sleep.

76
00:02:54,568 --> 00:02:56,568
So I sleep once and wake up again.

77
00:02:56,568 --> 00:02:57,568
That's amazing.

78
00:02:57,568 --> 00:02:59,568
I asked Hoshina's father.

79
00:03:00,568 --> 00:03:02,568
I asked him what he liked to eat.

80
00:03:02,568 --> 00:03:05,568
He said he liked to eat with his family.

81
00:03:05,568 --> 00:03:07,568
I got it!

82
00:03:07,568 --> 00:03:08,568
I'm sure it is.

83
00:03:09,568 --> 00:03:10,568
Ta-da!

84
00:03:10,568 --> 00:03:11,568
Yakiniku!

85
00:03:11,568 --> 00:03:14,568
He said anything was fine.

86
00:03:14,568 --> 00:03:18,568
He made me feel like eating Yakiniku.

87
00:03:18,568 --> 00:03:20,568
It's cute.

88
00:03:20,568 --> 00:03:26,568
I thought it would be fun to eat meat
with my family.

89
00:03:26,568 --> 00:03:27,568
It's a long-legged.

90
00:03:27,568 --> 00:03:29,568
It's cute.

91
00:03:29,568 --> 00:03:31,568
The answer is this.

92
00:03:31,568 --> 00:03:34,032
I did it!

93
00:03:35,032 --> 00:03:40,032
The unforgettable thing that Hoshina's
father said to his daughter was

94
00:03:40,032 --> 00:03:43,032
When he talked about his high school
graduation

95
00:03:43,032 --> 00:03:48,032
He said he wanted to go to university
for his future activities

96
00:03:48,032 --> 00:03:50,032
My father thinks about it

97
00:03:50,032 --> 00:03:52,032
I think so too

98
00:03:52,032 --> 00:03:55,032
I always bother him

99
00:03:55,032 --> 00:04:00,160
Hoshina got 20 points!

100
00:04:01,160 --> 00:04:03,160
Hello!

101
00:04:03,160 --> 00:04:05,160
Next is Rina!

102
00:04:05,160 --> 00:04:07,160
Are you confident?

103
00:04:07,160 --> 00:04:10,160
I'm so scared! I'm going to write
something weird!

104
00:04:10,160 --> 00:04:12,160
The father that Matsuno-san drew

105
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:14,160
It's similar!

106
00:04:14,160 --> 00:04:16,160
It's similar!

107
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:18,160
I drew this face as a man

108
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:19,160
That's right!

109
00:04:19,160 --> 00:04:21,160
So, the first question of the father
quiz!

110
00:04:21,160 --> 00:04:25,160
What is Matsuno-san's father's favorite
food?

111
00:04:25,160 --> 00:04:26,160
I know this!

112
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:28,160
Wait, there are two similar answers

113
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:29,160
Is this a hint?

114
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:31,160
If you say it's similar, you'll know!

115
00:04:33,160 --> 00:04:34,160
Tomato

116
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:36,160
Cute!

117
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:38,160
It's pasta

118
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:40,160
What is that?

119
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:44,160
What is your father's favorite food?

120
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:46,160
I like enoki mushrooms

121
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:48,160
So fashionable!

122
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:54,160
What does Matsuno-san's father always do
when he drinks?

123
00:04:55,224 --> 00:04:57,224
He sleeps right away and gets a little
upset

124
00:04:58,224 --> 00:05:00,224
I don't get it at all

125
00:05:00,224 --> 00:05:02,224
He sleeps on the floor until morning

126
00:05:02,224 --> 00:05:03,224
Oh, that's it

127
00:05:03,224 --> 00:05:05,224
By the way, is there anything you want
your father to fix?

128
00:05:05,224 --> 00:05:07,224
There's a lot of things, right?

129
00:05:07,224 --> 00:05:09,224
He's like, what?

130
00:05:09,224 --> 00:05:11,224
He does that all the time

131
00:05:11,224 --> 00:05:13,224
That's cute

132
00:05:13,224 --> 00:05:15,224
At first, he says, you did it, right?

133
00:05:15,224 --> 00:05:17,224
I know he says that

134
00:05:17,224 --> 00:05:19,224
But it's too much

135
00:05:19,224 --> 00:05:21,224
I'm tired of it

136
00:05:21,224 --> 00:05:22,864
I say

137
00:05:22,864 --> 00:05:24,864
I want my dad to take care of me

138
00:05:24,864 --> 00:05:26,864
What do you want your daughter to fix?

139
00:05:26,864 --> 00:05:27,864
There are many things

140
00:05:27,864 --> 00:05:29,864
What do you want your daughter to fix?

141
00:05:31,864 --> 00:05:33,864
By the way, what do you like about your
daughter?

142
00:05:33,864 --> 00:05:35,864
She is honest and pure

143
00:05:35,864 --> 00:05:37,864
She is strong

144
00:05:37,864 --> 00:05:38,864
You are watching her well

145
00:05:38,864 --> 00:05:40,864
I sometimes think I should fix my
daughter

146
00:05:40,864 --> 00:05:42,864
She is in a bad mood

147
00:05:42,864 --> 00:05:44,864
I want to fix that

148
00:05:44,864 --> 00:05:46,864
I want to fix my dad's mood

149
00:05:46,864 --> 00:05:48,864
I think you are similar to your dad

150
00:05:48,864 --> 00:05:50,864
She is similar to my daughter

151
00:05:50,864 --> 00:05:54,864
She gives me advice when I'm in trouble

152
00:05:54,864 --> 00:05:56,864
She is very helpful

153
00:05:56,864 --> 00:05:58,864
Thank you for watching

154
00:06:01,512 --> 00:06:02,512
Ebi-chu!

155
00:06:03,512 --> 00:06:04,512
The last one is Kashiwagi-san

156
00:06:05,512 --> 00:06:07,512
Let's start with Kashiwagi-san's father

157
00:06:08,512 --> 00:06:09,512
Sorry, my hair got longer

158
00:06:11,512 --> 00:06:13,512
Oh my god, you don't look like Obama-san

159
00:06:14,512 --> 00:06:16,512
Let's start the question

160
00:06:17,512 --> 00:06:19,512
What is Kashiwagi-san's father's
favorite food?

161
00:06:19,512 --> 00:06:20,512
I don't know

162
00:06:22,512 --> 00:06:23,512
White rice

163
00:06:24,512 --> 00:06:25,512
You are Japanese

164
00:06:25,512 --> 00:06:26,512
By the way,

165
00:06:26,512 --> 00:06:27,512
It's amazing

166
00:06:28,448 --> 00:06:31,448
What do you like?

167
00:06:31,448 --> 00:06:32,448
The answer is

168
00:06:32,448 --> 00:06:33,448
It's difficult

169
00:06:33,448 --> 00:06:34,448
Steamed pork

170
00:06:34,448 --> 00:06:35,448
What is steamed pork?

171
00:06:35,448 --> 00:06:36,448
It's steamed pork, right?

172
00:06:36,448 --> 00:06:39,448
Have you ever eaten it?

173
00:06:39,448 --> 00:06:40,448
Have you ever eaten it?

174
00:06:40,448 --> 00:06:42,448
Let's go home and ask

175
00:06:42,448 --> 00:06:44,448
Let's go home and ask your father

176
00:06:44,448 --> 00:06:45,448
Steamed pork?

177
00:06:45,448 --> 00:06:47,448
Let's move on to the next question

178
00:06:47,448 --> 00:06:49,448
I asked Kashiwagi's father

179
00:06:49,448 --> 00:06:52,448
If you could bring one thing to a
deserted island, what would you bring?

180
00:06:52,448 --> 00:06:54,448
What would I bring?

181
00:06:54,448 --> 00:06:55,448
This is amazing

182
00:06:55,448 --> 00:06:57,448
If it's a deserted island, there's
definitely nothing

183
00:06:57,448 --> 00:06:58,448
What?

184
00:06:58,448 --> 00:07:00,448
Then, open

185
00:07:00,448 --> 00:07:01,448
Mother

186
00:07:01,448 --> 00:07:03,448
Oh, by the way, why?

187
00:07:03,448 --> 00:07:05,448
I can't do anything without my mother

188
00:07:05,448 --> 00:07:06,448
Is that so?

189
00:07:06,448 --> 00:07:07,448
What's the answer?

190
00:07:07,448 --> 00:07:09,448
Correct

191
00:07:09,448 --> 00:07:12,448
And, listen, it's not a mother

192
00:07:12,448 --> 00:07:13,448
I want to love

193
00:07:13,448 --> 00:07:15,448
What is that?

194
00:07:15,448 --> 00:07:17,448
I want to love

195
00:07:17,448 --> 00:07:18,448
I want to love

196
00:07:18,448 --> 00:07:20,448
It's realistic

197
00:07:20,448 --> 00:07:21,448
It's going to be something

198
00:07:21,448 --> 00:07:24,448
I've never heard the word I want to love
before

199
00:07:24,448 --> 00:07:25,448
I've never heard it before

200
00:07:25,448 --> 00:07:28,448
I receive e-mails and LINE messages on
my birthday every year

201
00:07:28,448 --> 00:07:30,448
I'm always moved by the content

202
00:07:30,448 --> 00:07:32,448
I don't say the content of the past

203
00:07:32,448 --> 00:07:39,448
Thank you for always playing with me so
that we can have fun

204
00:07:39,448 --> 00:07:43,904
Let's play with your mother together
from now on

205
00:07:44,904 --> 00:07:45,904
I'm not sure.

206
00:07:45,904 --> 00:07:46,904
I'm not sure.

207
00:07:47,904 --> 00:07:50,904
The winner is Mirue Hoshiguma.

208
00:07:51,904 --> 00:07:52,904
Enjoy your meal.

209
00:07:52,904 --> 00:07:59,904
Thank you for watching.
