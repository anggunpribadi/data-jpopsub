1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Ebichu's video!

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Ebichu's video!

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:08,000
Ebichu's video!

4
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:15,000
This tour is the most meaningful tour
for Ebichu.

5
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:19,000
It's the first tour for nine people.

6
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:24,000
And Hinata's spring tour will be the
last tour.

7
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:31,000
I hope that the whole thing of Ebichu
Junior High School will be told.

8
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:35,000
I'm challenging myself.

9
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:46,000
Hokkaido was a tour that enjoyed unity.

10
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:56,000
I was sad that I couldn't sing after
that.

11
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:02,000
It was the first time for Ichikawa and
TDC.

12
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:08,000
But it was a warm performance for the
fans.

13
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:19,000
Each day, the songs are different.

14
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:34,000
The performance of the day of the A
pattern, the day of the secret kitchen,
and the day of the Sugar Graze was
danceable.

15
00:01:34,000 --> 00:02:01,720
The day of the B pattern, the day of the

16
00:02:01,720 --> 00:02:16,720
B pattern, the day of the Sugar Graze.

17
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:28,720
It was a tour that I wanted to meet the
fans all over the country.

18
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:46,720
I was happy to have a lot of fun.

19
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:54,720
I was supposed to meet everyone on the
first day of the A pattern.

20
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:55,458
I was happy to have a lot of fun.

21
00:02:55,458 --> 00:03:21,538
As the day went by, the fans

22
00:03:21,538 --> 00:03:24,498
helped by making up many.

23
00:03:24,498 --> 00:03:33,998
There were many performances that
betrayed the live performance that the
fans imagined.

24
00:03:33,998 --> 00:03:39,998
Including choreography, there were many
directions that made me feel like that.

25
00:03:39,998 --> 00:03:51,298
As we performed little by little, the
fans reacted so well that they couldn't
help but scream.

26
00:03:51,298 --> 00:03:58,298
The more we performed, the more we were
able to dance together.

27
00:03:58,298 --> 00:04:05,298
I felt that the live performance was
growing.

28
00:04:05,298 --> 00:04:22,298
I hope we can overcome the spring
together in the final.

29
00:04:22,298 --> 00:04:39,298
It's been a long time since I've done a
tour with many voices. I'm looking
forward to it.

30
00:04:39,298 --> 00:04:52,298
I'm glad that the nine of us performed
together.

31
00:04:52,298 --> 00:05:10,298
I was impressed by the number of people
who came to the concert.

32
00:05:10,298 --> 00:05:23,298
I was happy that the fans came to the
concert because they thought about us.

33
00:05:26,562 --> 00:05:49,562
Of course, it's good to listen to it
with a sound source, but I'm listening
to a lot of voices that I like a lot, so
I think that the song's impression is
amazing because I recommend it to the
production team.

34
00:05:49,562 --> 00:06:03,562
It's really good to end it, isn't it? I
feel like I'm doing a tour and I'm going
through it in a moment.

35
00:06:03,562 --> 00:06:28,562
It's a new album, but I want to make it
the best father that I can't think of
with this album, so I hope you can
listen to a lot of albums and enjoy it
together with your body.

36
00:06:28,562 --> 00:06:38,562
I announced that I would be transferring
in December, and the first stage was the
first day of the spring tour.

37
00:06:38,562 --> 00:07:05,562
The spring tour and everything else will
be the last of the Ebichu. I want to do
my best, but I want to make this park
fun and this tour fun.

38
00:07:05,562 --> 00:07:17,562
I'm doing a lot of things in a song.

39
00:07:17,562 --> 00:07:45,562
I'm kidding. I had a lot of fun doing
that. I didn't think about anything, so
I didn't know, so I enjoyed it until the
show.

40
00:07:45,562 --> 00:07:58,562
It was a song that I hadn't done before,
so it was very difficult to show it to
ourselves.

41
00:07:58,562 --> 00:08:03,618
The choreography itself is also quite
detailed.

42
00:08:03,618 --> 00:08:16,178
I thought it was difficult but fun to
sing, and I thought I had a good singing
ability.

43
00:08:16,178 --> 00:08:26,498
The number of times I can sing live is
decreasing with the members of EVIN.

44
00:08:26,498 --> 00:08:32,698
I will enjoy each and every one of them
without regret.

45
00:08:32,698 --> 00:08:36,738
I think everyone is the same.

46
00:08:36,738 --> 00:08:41,858
It's been a long time since I've done a
tour with nine members.

47
00:08:41,858 --> 00:08:48,498
I was wondering what would happen.

48
00:08:48,498 --> 00:09:02,738
It's been a long time since I've done a
tour, so I'm happy to meet everyone in
Japan.

49
00:09:02,738 --> 00:09:15,138
There are many cities in Niigata, Hachi-
Oji, and Tokyo.

50
00:09:15,138 --> 00:09:23,898
Niigata is a city that has been
completed.

51
00:09:23,898 --> 00:09:47,218
Tokyo City Hall has been completed, but
I was happy that the members took good
care of the tickets.

52
00:09:47,218 --> 00:09:53,378
I thought this album was special.

53
00:09:53,378 --> 00:10:00,618
The story is very interesting.

54
00:10:00,618 --> 00:10:06,418
I was wondering how to show the race-
comfortable atmosphere.

55
00:10:06,418 --> 00:10:15,938
I thought it would be interesting if the
story was similar.

56
00:10:15,938 --> 00:10:21,018
The tour is very fast.

57
00:10:21,018 --> 00:10:25,218
I was wondering how many performances
there were left.

58
00:10:25,218 --> 00:10:36,098
This time, I was really looking forward
to the final.

59
00:10:36,098 --> 00:10:38,562
I was surrounded by pan 09.

60
00:10:38,562 --> 00:10:58,082
I thought the blower was the last tour
with nine people, but personally, I
wanted to be the one who can find my
position as a nine-man band.

61
00:10:58,082 --> 00:11:11,322
At first, I couldn't go to Osaka Park
because of the health problem, but I'm
glad that I can go to the last tour with
everyone.

62
00:11:11,322 --> 00:11:20,282
The last tour was held in front of
Ichikawa Park.

63
00:11:20,282 --> 00:11:38,762
I was able to enjoy the time when Hinata
was there.

64
00:11:38,762 --> 00:11:41,562
I'm not good at explaining.

65
00:11:41,562 --> 00:11:46,762
It's really difficult.

66
00:11:46,762 --> 00:11:59,762
I still have a lot of things to do, but
I want to express myself more.

67
00:11:59,762 --> 00:12:20,322
I'm a group member who has been on tour
so far, but I think it's a tour that can
betray what you imagine.

68
00:12:20,322 --> 00:12:24,402
Please look forward to it.

69
00:12:24,402 --> 00:12:32,242
This tour is the 10th anniversary of the
TESTA anniversary.

70
00:12:32,242 --> 00:12:46,642
I'm grateful that I was able to go to
the last tour.

71
00:12:46,642 --> 00:13:00,722
I was able to perform at my hometown's
Ibaraki Park.

72
00:13:00,722 --> 00:13:17,682
I was able to enjoy the time when I was
able to perform at my hometown's Ibaraki
Park.

73
00:13:17,682 --> 00:13:25,506
I think that each song will show a
different Ebichu.

74
00:13:25,506 --> 00:13:29,866
And it's my first album as a member of
B2,

75
00:13:30,866 --> 00:13:35,666
so I was able to sing each song very
carefully.

76
00:13:36,266 --> 00:13:42,546
When I first received the album, I
really liked CURN.

77
00:13:43,146 --> 00:13:47,746
The dance is also a very unique
choreography.

78
00:13:47,746 --> 00:13:50,946
CURN is my favorite.

79
00:13:50,946 --> 00:13:55,946
When I sing, I get very excited, and
when I sing songs that give me
adrenaline,

80
00:13:55,946 --> 00:13:59,146
I get excited and enjoy it.

81
00:13:59,146 --> 00:14:01,946
I think the audience is also very easy
to get excited.

82
00:14:01,946 --> 00:14:06,186
I don't know what will happen at the
final performance,

83
00:14:06,186 --> 00:14:09,746
but I want to do my best to perform
well,

84
00:14:09,746 --> 00:14:15,346
so I don't get my hands dirty.

85
00:14:15,346 --> 00:14:21,346
I want to do my best to perform well.

86
00:14:23,346 --> 00:14:28,346
I've been performing a lot of live
performances, but I haven't done that
much.

87
00:14:28,346 --> 00:14:31,346
I think there are a lot of live
performances in spring.

88
00:14:31,346 --> 00:14:36,346
So I want to sing a little more through
that.

89
00:14:36,346 --> 00:14:39,346
When I'm here, I try to change my style.

90
00:14:39,346 --> 00:14:42,346
I also try to change my singing style.

91
00:14:42,346 --> 00:14:45,346
I also try to stop dancing.

92
00:14:45,346 --> 00:14:48,346
I think about various things in myself.

93
00:14:48,346 --> 00:14:52,346
I practiced a lot.

94
00:14:52,346 --> 00:14:59,346
I changed my style while performing
live.

95
00:14:59,346 --> 00:15:02,346
Hokkaido is the most memorable place.

96
00:15:02,346 --> 00:15:04,346
It was very hot.

97
00:15:04,346 --> 00:15:06,346
It wasn't the air conditioning.

98
00:15:06,346 --> 00:15:13,346
I had a lot of eye contact with people
who passed by me at the live
performance.

99
00:15:13,346 --> 00:15:16,346
I had a lot of eye contact with them.

100
00:15:16,346 --> 00:15:18,346
I had a lot of fun.

101
00:15:18,346 --> 00:15:21,346
I did my best in Hokkaido.

102
00:15:21,346 --> 00:15:23,346
I'm doing my best at all the live
performances.

103
00:15:23,346 --> 00:15:26,346
There was a song that I entered during
the spring tour.

104
00:15:26,346 --> 00:15:29,346
I thought this song would be a dance.

105
00:15:29,346 --> 00:15:35,346
I wondered how the family would dance
when they saw it.

106
00:15:35,346 --> 00:15:40,346
I was happy to see the family dance.

107
00:15:40,346 --> 00:15:44,346
There is no song called KOKO MIRA.

108
00:15:44,346 --> 00:15:50,346
I don't dance to the music.

109
00:15:50,346 --> 00:15:54,346
I don't listen to music very much.

110
00:15:54,346 --> 00:16:00,346
I'm struggling.

111
00:16:00,346 --> 00:16:03,330
The last performance.

112
00:16:03,330 --> 00:16:08,730
This is the last episode of the spring
tour,

113
00:16:10,730 --> 00:16:14,730
so I'll do my best until the end.

114
00:16:16,430 --> 00:16:20,330
This is the first spring tour for nine
of us,

115
00:16:20,430 --> 00:16:22,630
but it's also the last one for nine of
us,

116
00:16:22,730 --> 00:16:25,730
so I hope we can make great memories.

117
00:16:25,830 --> 00:16:30,630
I set a goal for each performance,

118
00:16:30,630 --> 00:16:33,830
and I hope I can show my best
performance today,

119
00:16:33,930 --> 00:16:36,430
and I hope I can sing well today.

120
00:16:36,530 --> 00:16:39,430
I'm going to set a goal for each
performance,

121
00:16:39,530 --> 00:16:43,930
and I hope I can show the best
performance today.

122
00:16:44,030 --> 00:16:46,430
I'm going to do my best.

123
00:16:47,530 --> 00:16:50,230
I'm the most impressed with the
Hachioji.

124
00:16:50,330 --> 00:16:53,630
I'm so happy that we made it with nine
of us.

125
00:16:53,730 --> 00:16:59,530
I'm so grateful for everyone who waited
for us.

126
00:16:59,530 --> 00:17:06,530
I'm so happy that I was praised by
Emiko-sensei for the Hachioji.

127
00:17:06,630 --> 00:17:10,330
I think that's what I'm most impressed
with.

128
00:17:10,430 --> 00:17:13,930
It's different when you have to dance.

129
00:17:14,030 --> 00:17:16,630
It's more fun to dance.

130
00:17:16,730 --> 00:17:22,230
The Taki-Meki Taki-Shin-Matsurun is a
fun dance.

131
00:17:22,330 --> 00:17:25,330
It's fun to dance with energy.

132
00:17:25,430 --> 00:17:29,030
Some of you may remember it already,

133
00:17:29,030 --> 00:17:32,230
but some of you may remember it already,

134
00:17:32,330 --> 00:17:34,830
like the pose of the song,

135
00:17:34,930 --> 00:17:38,330
and the dance of the song.

136
00:17:38,430 --> 00:17:42,830
I hope we can do that with the audience.

137
00:17:42,930 --> 00:17:47,730
It's already the end,

138
00:17:47,830 --> 00:17:52,530
but I hope we can make a great
performance

139
00:17:52,630 --> 00:17:56,430
so that the nine of us can say,

140
00:17:56,430 --> 00:17:59,230
We're going to have fun,

141
00:17:59,330 --> 00:18:04,330
but I hope we can have fun with the
audience.

142
00:18:04,430 --> 00:18:08,830
What's the last performance you want to
do?

143
00:18:08,930 --> 00:18:09,930
I'm Kokono Sakurai.

144
00:18:10,030 --> 00:18:10,830
I'm Koko Boino.

145
00:18:10,930 --> 00:18:12,230
I'm Naka Hajime.

146
00:18:12,330 --> 00:18:14,930
What's the last performance you want to
do?

147
00:18:15,030 --> 00:18:17,730
It's the last performance of the grand
final.

148
00:18:17,830 --> 00:18:23,130
Until now, we didn't plan to do this in
the next performance,

149
00:18:23,130 --> 00:18:26,630
but we did it in the grand final.

150
00:18:26,730 --> 00:18:31,830
We couldn't do it again in the final.

151
00:18:31,930 --> 00:18:34,530
We couldn't do it again.

152
00:18:34,630 --> 00:18:37,130
It's the end.

153
00:18:37,230 --> 00:18:39,030
I feel a little sad.

154
00:18:39,130 --> 00:18:40,430
We can't do it again.

155
00:18:40,530 --> 00:18:47,430
We'll do everything we've done since
April.

156
00:18:47,530 --> 00:18:50,630
What's the last performance you want to
do?

157
00:18:50,630 --> 00:18:59,230
The last performance is the last
performance of the grand final.

158
00:18:59,394 --> 00:19:02,394
What?

159
00:19:02,394 --> 00:19:05,394
The first...

160
00:19:08,394 --> 00:19:10,394
spring tour...

161
00:19:10,394 --> 00:19:12,394
Wait.

162
00:19:12,394 --> 00:19:13,394
It's okay.

163
00:19:13,394 --> 00:19:14,394
The scary part.

164
00:19:14,394 --> 00:19:16,394
It's difficult.

165
00:19:16,394 --> 00:19:18,394
The first one?

166
00:19:18,394 --> 00:19:20,394
I thought it was difficult.

167
00:19:20,394 --> 00:19:21,394
It's scary.

168
00:19:21,394 --> 00:19:23,394
Don't say it.

169
00:19:23,394 --> 00:19:24,394
It's embarrassing.

170
00:19:24,394 --> 00:19:25,394
It's embarrassing.

171
00:19:25,394 --> 00:19:29,394
I get used to it.

172
00:19:29,394 --> 00:19:31,394
I have to do it.

173
00:19:31,394 --> 00:19:34,394
I want to do it when I have to.

174
00:19:34,394 --> 00:19:37,394
But I'm getting used to it.

175
00:19:37,394 --> 00:19:41,394
I thought it wouldn't work.

176
00:19:41,394 --> 00:19:43,394
It's the first time.

177
00:19:43,394 --> 00:19:44,394
It's true.

178
00:19:44,394 --> 00:19:48,394
The first spring tour is difficult.

179
00:19:49,394 --> 00:19:50,394
It's great.

180
00:19:50,394 --> 00:19:52,394
It's not that bad.

181
00:19:52,394 --> 00:19:54,394
What do you think?

182
00:19:54,394 --> 00:19:57,394
We often gather in the room.

183
00:19:57,394 --> 00:19:59,394
We do.

184
00:19:59,394 --> 00:20:02,394
You and Nonoka sleep together.

185
00:20:02,394 --> 00:20:04,394
That's true.

186
00:20:06,394 --> 00:20:07,394
Let's say it.

187
00:20:07,394 --> 00:20:09,394
When we were in Hokkaido,

188
00:20:09,394 --> 00:20:12,394
Nonoka was late because she was
sleeping.

189
00:20:12,394 --> 00:20:14,394
We never slept together.

190
00:20:14,394 --> 00:20:16,394
We slept separately.

191
00:20:16,394 --> 00:20:20,394
So she didn't notice.

192
00:20:20,394 --> 00:20:24,394
I regretted it.

193
00:20:24,394 --> 00:20:26,394
I slept with her.

194
00:20:26,394 --> 00:20:28,394
We woke up together.

195
00:20:28,394 --> 00:20:30,394
We didn't get late.

196
00:20:30,394 --> 00:20:32,394
I'm sorry.

197
00:20:32,394 --> 00:20:34,394
I'll do my best.

198
00:20:34,394 --> 00:20:36,394
I'll do my best.

199
00:20:37,394 --> 00:20:40,394
What did you do?

200
00:20:40,394 --> 00:20:42,394
We went to the same place.

201
00:20:42,394 --> 00:20:46,394
We ate takoyaki in Osaka.

202
00:20:46,394 --> 00:20:48,394
We ate pork buns.

203
00:20:48,394 --> 00:20:50,394
We ate pork buns.

204
00:20:50,394 --> 00:20:52,394
You didn't eat pork buns?

205
00:20:52,394 --> 00:20:54,394
Did you eat blood?

206
00:20:54,394 --> 00:20:55,394
No.

207
00:20:55,394 --> 00:20:57,394
I ate ice cream.

208
00:20:57,394 --> 00:20:59,394
I ate ice cream.

209
00:20:59,394 --> 00:21:01,394
You ate ice cream?

210
00:21:01,394 --> 00:21:03,394
I was joking.

211
00:21:04,394 --> 00:21:06,394
What do you think of the tour?

212
00:21:06,394 --> 00:21:08,394
It's dangerous.

213
00:21:09,394 --> 00:21:11,394
The tour final is...

214
00:21:11,394 --> 00:21:14,394
The people who came to the tour...

215
00:21:14,394 --> 00:21:17,394
They can enjoy it.

216
00:21:17,394 --> 00:21:19,394
If you make fun of us...

217
00:21:19,394 --> 00:21:21,394
Don't do it.

218
00:21:21,394 --> 00:21:23,394
Don't do it properly.

219
00:21:23,394 --> 00:21:24,394
No.

220
00:21:24,394 --> 00:21:27,394
We'll have new songs.

221
00:21:27,394 --> 00:21:29,394
We won't make fun of you.

222
00:21:29,394 --> 00:21:32,394
We'll do songs we didn't do on the tour.

223
00:21:32,394 --> 00:21:34,394
We'll do songs we didn't do on the tour.

224
00:21:34,394 --> 00:21:37,394
We'll play songs from the album.

225
00:21:37,394 --> 00:21:39,394
We'll have fun.

226
00:21:39,394 --> 00:21:41,394
We'll have fun.

227
00:21:41,394 --> 00:21:43,394
We'll have fun.

228
00:21:43,394 --> 00:21:47,394
The people who came to the tour can
enjoy it.

229
00:21:47,682 --> 00:21:49,682
The next day

230
00:21:50,442 --> 00:21:54,122
I didn't expect the guard who was on
patrol to be a thief.

231
00:21:54,122 --> 00:21:57,042
But he skipped the mission and went
home.

232
00:21:57,042 --> 00:21:59,482
The song strategy was a big success.

233
00:21:59,482 --> 00:22:02,442
But when Kokona disappeared, it was a
set.

234
00:22:02,442 --> 00:22:04,202
We can't beat the lightning.

235
00:22:04,202 --> 00:22:06,722
Well, if it's good, it's all good.

236
00:22:06,722 --> 00:22:08,322
Then let's go to the party.

237
00:22:08,322 --> 00:22:10,002
It's a happy set with a man.

238
00:22:10,002 --> 00:22:11,522
No, no, happy turn.

239
00:22:11,522 --> 00:22:12,682
Let's eat chicken first.

240
00:22:12,682 --> 00:22:14,282
Protein too.

241
00:22:14,282 --> 00:22:17,082
Well, well, everyone has forgotten.

242
00:22:17,082 --> 00:22:19,482
We're not good at it.
