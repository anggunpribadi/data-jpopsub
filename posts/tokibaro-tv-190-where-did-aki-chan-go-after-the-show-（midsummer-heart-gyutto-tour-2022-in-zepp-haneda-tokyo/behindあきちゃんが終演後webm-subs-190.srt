1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
The next day

2
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,000
Good morning

3
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
Today is Mary

4
00:00:21,146 --> 00:00:23,146
Yes!

5
00:00:23,146 --> 00:00:27,146
Ta-da! Everyone's cell phone case is now
a shoulder bag!

6
00:00:27,146 --> 00:00:29,146
The ratio is increasing!

7
00:00:29,146 --> 00:00:31,146
Three people!

8
00:00:31,146 --> 00:00:33,146
What happened to Aikito-chan?

9
00:00:33,146 --> 00:00:37,146
She was the first member to make it a
shoulder bag.

10
00:00:37,146 --> 00:00:39,146
What happened now?

11
00:00:39,146 --> 00:00:43,168
I'm going to make it a shoulder bag.

12
00:00:43,168 --> 00:00:46,168
I thought it was a shoulder bag.

13
00:00:46,168 --> 00:00:48,168
It's a twin.

14
00:00:48,168 --> 00:00:53,562
I thought it was a shoulder bag.

15
00:00:53,562 --> 00:00:55,562
It's fast.

16
00:00:55,562 --> 00:00:57,562
It's like 10 minutes.

17
00:00:57,562 --> 00:00:59,562
It's faster than usual.

18
00:00:59,562 --> 00:01:01,562
It's not.

19
00:01:01,562 --> 00:01:03,562
It's more than a month.

20
00:01:05,562 --> 00:01:07,562
I feel relieved.

21
00:01:07,562 --> 00:01:09,562
It's like the usual place.

22
00:01:11,562 --> 00:01:13,562
Let's do our best.

23
00:01:13,562 --> 00:01:16,282
It's like a big slum.

24
00:01:16,282 --> 00:01:21,282
We started to do a lot of things since
the day after.

25
00:01:21,282 --> 00:01:24,282
We had a live show at the end.

26
00:01:24,282 --> 00:01:25,282
That's right.

27
00:01:29,282 --> 00:01:31,282
I don't want to do this anymore.

28
00:01:31,282 --> 00:01:33,280
I'm going to cry.

29
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:39,880
Everyone, I think I'm still in a dreamy
mood today.

30
00:01:39,880 --> 00:01:40,880
Tomorrow too.

31
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:41,880
Yeah.

32
00:01:41,880 --> 00:01:42,880
After tomorrow.

33
00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:44,880
I'll do my best.

34
00:01:45,880 --> 00:01:46,880
I'm sorry.

35
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:47,880
I'm sorry.

36
00:01:47,880 --> 00:01:48,880
I'm sorry.

37
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:54,042
I'm sorry.

38
00:01:54,042 --> 00:01:56,042
Good morning everyone!

39
00:01:57,042 --> 00:02:01,042
Today I'm with ZEPP HANEDA TOKYO!

40
00:02:02,042 --> 00:02:06,042
It's my first time at ZEPP HANEDA!

41
00:02:07,042 --> 00:02:10,042
So I'm going to eat lunch now!

42
00:02:11,042 --> 00:02:14,042
This time I'm eating Chinese food!

43
00:02:16,042 --> 00:02:20,042
There's eggplant, shrimp, chili, and
many other things!

44
00:02:20,042 --> 00:02:23,042
I'm going to eat now! Bye bye!

45
00:02:28,282 --> 00:02:32,282
I got an extra bed.

46
00:02:32,282 --> 00:02:50,282
For the rest of this night, I will focus
on Furthermore stigma on.

47
00:02:51,282 --> 00:02:53,762
Lightly

48
00:02:54,282 --> 00:02:56,282
See you!

49
00:02:56,282 --> 00:03:03,994
Little girl lying on the floor

50
00:03:03,994 --> 00:03:07,994
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6

51
00:03:07,994 --> 00:03:12,994
We are showing our best to the staff.

52
00:03:12,994 --> 00:03:14,994
Thank you.

53
00:03:14,994 --> 00:03:16,994
Good morning.

54
00:03:16,994 --> 00:03:17,994
Good morning.

55
00:03:17,994 --> 00:03:18,994
Good morning.

56
00:03:18,994 --> 00:03:19,994
Good morning.

57
00:03:19,994 --> 00:03:20,994
Good morning.

58
00:03:20,994 --> 00:03:21,994
Good morning.

59
00:03:21,994 --> 00:03:22,994
Please come to the monitor.

60
00:03:22,994 --> 00:03:24,994
No.1, it's okay.

61
00:03:24,994 --> 00:03:26,994
No.2, it's okay.

62
00:03:26,994 --> 00:03:38,994
Thank you.

63
00:03:39,738 --> 00:03:41,738
The one I'm wearing now?

64
00:03:41,738 --> 00:03:43,738
Is it the one from LALA?

65
00:03:43,738 --> 00:03:45,738
No, it's the one from Kanami.

66
00:03:45,738 --> 00:03:47,738
It's not from Kanami.

67
00:03:47,738 --> 00:03:49,738
It's because there are three of them.

68
00:03:49,738 --> 00:03:51,738
I see.

69
00:03:51,738 --> 00:03:53,738
LALA.

70
00:03:53,738 --> 00:03:55,738
There are two of them.

71
00:03:55,738 --> 00:03:57,738
Thank you.

72
00:04:01,738 --> 00:04:03,738
Hello.

73
00:04:03,738 --> 00:04:05,738
Bye.

74
00:04:05,738 --> 00:04:07,738
Bye.

75
00:04:07,738 --> 00:04:08,832
I'll do my best.

76
00:04:08,832 --> 00:04:18,906
I'll do my best.

77
00:04:18,906 --> 00:04:22,906
How is it?

78
00:04:25,906 --> 00:04:27,906
Look at this!

79
00:04:27,906 --> 00:04:30,906
I got my makeup done!

80
00:04:30,906 --> 00:04:35,312
Today's best makeup artist is...

81
00:04:35,312 --> 00:04:42,312
I'm relieved that she did my bangs.

82
00:04:43,312 --> 00:04:47,312
I'm talking in Japanese today.

83
00:04:48,312 --> 00:04:51,312
It's really hot when I'm on stage.

84
00:04:52,312 --> 00:04:56,312
My bangs aren't broken, so I don't look
like I'm sweating.

85
00:04:57,312 --> 00:04:59,312
That's my bangs magic.

86
00:04:59,312 --> 00:05:04,506
I'll do my best.

87
00:05:04,506 --> 00:05:06,506
I'm going to be the shadow of today.

88
00:05:06,506 --> 00:05:08,506
I'll do my best.

89
00:05:08,506 --> 00:05:10,506
You can do it, Aki.

90
00:05:10,506 --> 00:05:12,506
I'll do my best.

91
00:05:12,506 --> 00:05:14,506
What's the announcement?

92
00:05:14,506 --> 00:05:16,506
Announcement is...

93
00:05:16,506 --> 00:05:18,506
New single.

94
00:05:18,506 --> 00:05:20,506
It's a new single.

95
00:05:20,506 --> 00:05:22,506
It's a new single.

96
00:05:22,506 --> 00:05:24,506
It's a new single.

97
00:05:24,506 --> 00:05:26,506
It's a new single.

98
00:05:26,506 --> 00:05:28,506
It's a new single.

99
00:05:28,506 --> 00:05:29,978
It's a new single.

100
00:05:29,978 --> 00:05:31,978
I'm done.

101
00:05:31,978 --> 00:05:33,978
It's already over.

102
00:05:37,978 --> 00:05:39,978
Let's go to the key hole.

103
00:05:39,978 --> 00:05:41,978
There's a water drop.

104
00:05:41,978 --> 00:05:43,978
A moment of tension.

105
00:05:45,978 --> 00:05:47,978
Let's go to the key hole.

106
00:05:47,978 --> 00:05:57,978
Today, we're going to the Summer Heart
Good Tour 2022 with the three key
characters of the Super Tokimeki
Publicity Department.

107
00:05:57,978 --> 00:06:01,978
Thank you for coming.

108
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:05,840
Thank you. I'm Hiyorin.

109
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:12,840
I'd like to ask the audience to stand up
and stand in line.

110
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:18,840
The audience who has sat down in front
of the stage twice cannot stand up and
watch.

111
00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:27,840
Please sit down and watch.

112
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:32,464
I'll do my best.

113
00:06:32,464 --> 00:06:34,464
I'm sorry.

114
00:06:34,464 --> 00:06:36,464
I'm sorry.

115
00:06:36,464 --> 00:06:38,464
We'll be back soon.

116
00:06:40,464 --> 00:06:44,464
Are you ready to have fun?

117
00:06:48,464 --> 00:06:53,464
Please pay attention to the members'
hair.

118
00:06:53,464 --> 00:06:57,464
I'll be right back after this.

119
00:06:57,464 --> 00:07:02,096
Let's have fun.

120
00:07:02,096 --> 00:07:04,096
Nice to meet you.

121
00:07:04,096 --> 00:07:05,096
Thank you.

122
00:07:05,096 --> 00:07:08,096
3, 2, 1, start!

123
00:07:09,096 --> 00:07:11,096
Lock on!

124
00:07:11,096 --> 00:07:12,096
Yes!

125
00:07:12,096 --> 00:07:14,096
Let's do our best.

126
00:07:14,096 --> 00:07:15,096
Move to the next location.

127
00:07:15,096 --> 00:07:16,096
Thank you.

128
00:07:18,096 --> 00:07:20,096
Let's do our best.

129
00:07:20,096 --> 00:07:21,096
Bye bye.

130
00:07:21,096 --> 00:07:22,096
Good luck.

131
00:07:22,096 --> 00:07:23,096
Good luck.

132
00:07:24,096 --> 00:07:28,096
We'll do our best after the comeback.

133
00:07:28,096 --> 00:07:29,872
We'll do our best.

134
00:07:29,872 --> 00:07:37,872
I was so happy to see Hyorin's smile.

135
00:07:37,872 --> 00:07:40,872
It's really funny.

136
00:07:40,872 --> 00:07:47,104
I was a little nervous, but I'm fine.

137
00:07:47,104 --> 00:08:06,104
I'll do my best to perform for you to
see.

138
00:08:10,554 --> 00:08:14,554
It's a bit cool, isn't it?

139
00:08:15,554 --> 00:08:19,554
Please look forward to it.

140
00:08:20,554 --> 00:08:22,554
Thank you very much.

141
00:08:29,554 --> 00:08:31,554
I'm back from dinner.

142
00:08:31,554 --> 00:08:35,536
I'm going to eat dinner.

143
00:08:35,536 --> 00:08:39,536
I got pretzels from Sanrio.

144
00:08:39,536 --> 00:08:41,536
I'm going to eat.

145
00:08:41,536 --> 00:08:49,536
I'm going to eat.

146
00:08:51,536 --> 00:08:53,536
I'm done.

147
00:08:53,536 --> 00:09:20,986
I'm going to eat.

148
00:09:20,986 --> 00:09:23,986
I got my hair done.

149
00:09:23,986 --> 00:09:25,986
This is Kuma's room.

150
00:09:25,986 --> 00:09:27,986
Listen to me.

151
00:09:27,986 --> 00:09:31,986
I had my makeup fixed.

152
00:09:31,986 --> 00:09:34,986
I had lunch.

153
00:09:34,986 --> 00:09:38,986
I was so sleepy after lunch.

154
00:09:38,986 --> 00:09:42,986
I was like,

155
00:09:42,986 --> 00:09:45,986
but the makeup artist said I could
sleep.

156
00:09:45,986 --> 00:09:50,986
I was so nervous.

157
00:09:50,986 --> 00:09:53,986
When I got my bangs done,

158
00:09:53,986 --> 00:09:55,986
I was like,

159
00:09:55,986 --> 00:09:57,986
I'm wearing an iron, so I'm going to
wake up.

160
00:09:57,986 --> 00:10:01,986
Suddenly, I was like,

161
00:10:01,986 --> 00:10:08,986
I woke up.

162
00:10:08,986 --> 00:10:11,986
I laughed at the makeup artist.

163
00:10:11,986 --> 00:10:16,986
I was surprised.

164
00:10:16,986 --> 00:10:28,218
It was fun.

165
00:10:28,218 --> 00:10:39,218
I'm going to do my makeup now and have
my bangs tightened.

166
00:10:41,218 --> 00:10:43,218
Oh, who's that from behind?

167
00:10:47,218 --> 00:10:49,218
Hey, Asan.

168
00:10:51,218 --> 00:10:54,218
How's your hair and makeup today?

169
00:10:54,218 --> 00:10:58,218
My hair and makeup today is going well.

170
00:10:58,554 --> 00:11:05,554
I'm going to see it when I'm in a good
place.

171
00:11:05,554 --> 00:11:11,554
Recently, Katakake smartphone shoulder
is also popular.

172
00:11:11,554 --> 00:11:13,554
I'm thinking of buying it.

173
00:11:13,554 --> 00:11:15,554
It's really good.

174
00:11:15,554 --> 00:11:18,554
Let's match the glasses.

175
00:11:18,554 --> 00:11:20,554
Bye bye.

176
00:11:20,554 --> 00:11:25,554
I like this hairstyle.

177
00:11:27,066 --> 00:11:31,066
I'm next at Kitsuji-san indoors.

178
00:11:31,066 --> 00:11:37,126
Page 25

179
00:11:37,126 --> 00:11:40,326
This is Arashi Bourjee.

180
00:11:40,326 --> 00:11:45,026
Thank you for watching.

181
00:11:45,050 --> 00:11:48,490
This one is with tape.

182
00:11:48,490 --> 00:11:49,490
So cute!

183
00:11:56,538 --> 00:11:59,538
I'm going to do the same thing.

184
00:11:59,538 --> 00:12:00,538
Pineapple?

185
00:12:00,538 --> 00:12:01,538
No, no.

186
00:12:02,538 --> 00:12:04,538
One, two, three.

187
00:12:04,538 --> 00:12:06,538
One, two, three.

188
00:12:07,538 --> 00:12:08,538
Just like this.

189
00:12:08,538 --> 00:12:09,538
Okay.

190
00:12:09,538 --> 00:12:12,416
Don't go back.

191
00:12:12,416 --> 00:12:14,416
I should read from here? From today?

192
00:12:14,416 --> 00:12:16,416
Yes, from today.

193
00:12:16,416 --> 00:12:18,416
You should read from here.

194
00:12:18,416 --> 00:12:20,416
I should read from here.

195
00:12:26,416 --> 00:12:36,416
Thank you for coming to the 2022 Monatsu

00:12:45,770 --> 00:12:50,770
The audience sitting in the front row
cannot watch the performance.

200
00:12:50,770 --> 00:12:54,770
Please sit down and watch the
performance.

201
00:12:54,770 --> 00:12:57,770
The audience will shout out loud for the
1000 yen.

202
00:12:57,770 --> 00:13:00,770
You can't jump.

203
00:13:00,770 --> 00:13:05,770
Aki-chan is cute.

204
00:13:05,770 --> 00:13:08,770

213
00:14:21,906 --> 00:14:25,906
The fans will be able to watch the live
show of the show.

214
00:14:25,906 --> 00:14:29,906
But, before the show, the last
Christmas,

215
00:14:29,906 --> 00:14:33,906
the staff of the show will be able to
watch it.

216
00:14:33,906 --> 00:14:37,906
The staff of the show will be able to
watch it.

217
00:14:37,906 --> 00:14:41,562
The staff of the show will be able to
watch it.

218
00:14:41,562 --> 00:14:44,562
I have a lot of memories of this event.

219
00:14:44,562 --> 00:14:50,562
I'm so happy that you guys came to the
last Christmas party.

220
00:14:50,562 --> 00:14:54,562
Please make good memories with us.

221
00:14:54,562 --> 00:14:57,562
Thank you.

222
00:14:57,562 --> 00:14:59,562
It's so beautiful.

223
00:14:59,562 --> 00:15:01,562
It's so beautiful.

224
00:15:01,562 --> 00:15:04,890
It's so beautiful.

225
00:15:04,890 --> 00:15:10,890
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven,
eight, nine, ten.

226
00:15:10,890 --> 00:15:14,566
Let's do it together.

227
00:15:14,566 --> 00:15:16,886
It'll be fun.

228
00:15:26,086 --> 00:15:28,646
I can't believe I'm taking these to my
own George Ford.

229
00:15:37,606 --> 00:15:39,846
I don't know got me here.

230
00:15:41,466 --> 00:15:43,606
Thank you so much.

231
00:15:43,606 --> 00:15:45,606
Thank you!

232
00:15:46,106 --> 00:15:49,106
Thank you for coming to the event.

233
00:15:49,106 --> 00:15:51,106
Thank you for coming.

234
00:15:51,106 --> 00:15:57,106
Thank you for coming.

235
00:15:59,106 --> 00:16:01,106
Thank you.

236
00:16:09,106 --> 00:16:12,106
Thank you.

237
00:16:12,106 --> 00:16:15,106
Thank you.

238
00:16:18,106 --> 00:16:21,106
Thank you.

239
00:16:21,106 --> 00:16:24,922
Thank you.

240
00:16:24,922 --> 00:16:29,922
Thank you for coming to Hameda Park,
Tokyo!

241
00:16:32,890 --> 00:16:34,890
It was the first time we met.

242
00:16:34,890 --> 00:16:42,522
I'm glad to meet you.

243
00:16:42,522 --> 00:16:44,522
Thank you for watching!

244
00:16:56,538 --> 00:16:58,538
I'm glad to be able to do it.

245
00:16:58,538 --> 00:17:01,538
Thank you very much.

246
00:17:01,538 --> 00:17:06,266
It was really fun to have you cheer for
me.

247
00:17:06,266 --> 00:17:11,266
Osaka and Sendai Park are a little far
away.

248
00:17:14,266 --> 00:17:16,266
It was really full of flowers.

249
00:17:16,266 --> 00:17:19,266
I was happy to see it.

250
00:17:19,266 --> 00:17:22,266
Thank you very much.

251
00:17:22,266 --> 00:17:24,266
I'll do my best.

252
00:17:24,266 --> 00:17:27,266
Thank you very much.

253
00:17:27,266 --> 00:17:30,298
Thank you very much.

254
00:17:30,298 --> 00:17:32,298
How was it, Julia?

255
00:17:32,298 --> 00:17:34,298
It was so sudden.

256
00:17:34,298 --> 00:17:39,298
I didn't think it had been over a month
since the tour started.

257
00:17:39,298 --> 00:17:40,298
Really?

258
00:17:40,298 --> 00:17:41,298
It was already September.

259
00:17:41,298 --> 00:17:42,298
I see.

260
00:17:42,298 --> 00:17:52,298
I hope we can be a little more powerful
at today's live show and get a lot of
support tomorrow.

261
00:17:52,298 --> 00:17:54,298
I'm looking forward to it.

262
00:17:54,298 --> 00:18:00,298
We have a lot of announcements to make.

263
00:18:00,298 --> 00:18:09,298
First of all, we have a new single,
STAR, scheduled to be released on
November 9th.

264
00:18:09,298 --> 00:18:11,298
It's been a while since we released a
single.

265
00:18:11,298 --> 00:18:12,298
That's right.

266
00:18:12,298 --> 00:18:13,298
We've been working on an album.

267
00:18:13,298 --> 00:18:16,298
We also want to do a message to our
fans.

268
00:18:16,298 --> 00:18:18,298
We want to send a message to our fans.

269
00:18:18,298 --> 00:18:20,298
New single STAR.

270
00:18:20,298 --> 00:18:21,298
What?

271
00:18:21,298 --> 00:18:22,298
What is it?

272
00:18:22,298 --> 00:18:23,298
What is this?

273
00:18:23,298 --> 00:18:24,298
What is this?

274
00:18:24,298 --> 00:18:27,298
Please look forward to it.

275
00:18:27,298 --> 00:18:28,298
We've already recorded it.

276
00:18:28,298 --> 00:18:29,298
Yes.

277
00:18:29,298 --> 00:18:30,298
STAR.

278
00:18:30,298 --> 00:18:32,298
It's a good song.

279
00:18:32,298 --> 00:18:33,298
It's a really good song.

280
00:18:33,298 --> 00:18:34,298
It was a little difficult.

281
00:18:34,298 --> 00:18:35,298
It was difficult.

282
00:18:35,298 --> 00:18:38,298
It was a new challenge.

283
00:18:38,298 --> 00:18:40,298
But it's a really good song.

284
00:18:40,298 --> 00:18:41,298
It's a really good song.

285
00:18:41,298 --> 00:18:48,298
And Christmas is December 24th and 25th.

286
00:18:48,298 --> 00:18:53,298
It's a live performance with a live
band.

287
00:18:53,968 --> 00:19:16,448
Monsieur

288
00:19:16,448 --> 00:19:22,448
I'm not going to be a little bit of a
song.

289
00:19:22,448 --> 00:19:28,448
I'm sure it's different from the
previous songs.

290
00:19:28,448 --> 00:19:34,448
I want to do a lot of cool songs with
the song.

291
00:19:34,448 --> 00:19:40,448
I want to do a lot of cool songs with
the song.

292
00:19:40,448 --> 00:19:46,448
And, I'm going to be with you today.

293
00:19:46,448 --> 00:19:52,448
I'm going to be with you in November.

294
00:19:52,448 --> 00:19:55,448
I'm going to be back.

295
00:19:55,448 --> 00:19:59,920
I'm so happy.

296
00:19:59,920 --> 00:20:01,920
I'm looking forward to it.

297
00:20:01,920 --> 00:20:03,920
We have a lot of plans.

298
00:20:03,920 --> 00:20:07,920
Please look forward to it.

299
00:20:07,920 --> 00:20:09,920
Please look forward to it.

300
00:20:09,920 --> 00:20:11,920
Thank you very much.

301
00:20:11,920 --> 00:20:13,920
Let's have fun.

302
00:20:13,920 --> 00:20:15,920
Next is Osaka.

303
00:20:15,920 --> 00:20:18,704
Thank you very much.

304
00:20:18,704 --> 00:20:20,704
It's been a long time.

305
00:20:20,704 --> 00:20:22,704
Takisama!

306
00:20:22,704 --> 00:20:24,704
It was fun.

307
00:20:24,704 --> 00:20:26,704
It's a song called Nako.

308
00:20:26,704 --> 00:20:28,704
Saitama Super Arena 2021

309
00:20:28,704 --> 00:20:30,704
Saitama Super Arena 2020

310
00:20:30,704 --> 00:20:32,704
I only did it live.

311
00:20:32,704 --> 00:20:34,704
I didn't do it.

312
00:20:34,704 --> 00:20:36,704
I'm nervous.

313
00:20:36,704 --> 00:20:38,704
It's not related to the world.

314
00:20:38,704 --> 00:20:40,704
Live sound source

315
00:20:40,704 --> 00:20:42,704
It's recorded.

316
00:20:42,704 --> 00:20:44,704
In the previous single.

317
00:20:44,704 --> 00:20:46,704
If you listen to the sound source,

318
00:20:46,704 --> 00:20:48,704
I found a cute voice.

319
00:20:48,704 --> 00:20:50,704
What?

320
00:20:50,704 --> 00:20:52,704
Namiwa-Ruki

321
00:20:52,704 --> 00:20:54,704
Puka

322
00:20:54,704 --> 00:20:56,704
Puka Puka Puka

323
00:20:56,704 --> 00:20:58,704
It's like a space.

324
00:20:58,704 --> 00:21:00,704
There's a cute voice.

325
00:21:00,704 --> 00:21:02,704
I want you to listen to it.

326
00:21:02,704 --> 00:21:04,704
Puka Puka Puka

327
00:21:04,704 --> 00:21:07,616
Puka Puka Puka

328
00:21:07,616 --> 00:21:10,616
Let's ask.

329
00:21:12,616 --> 00:21:15,616
Who was it?

330
00:21:15,616 --> 00:21:17,616
I think it was one of us.

331
00:21:17,616 --> 00:21:20,616
I don't know. I think it was one of us.

332
00:21:20,616 --> 00:21:23,616
Let's ask who it was.

333
00:21:23,616 --> 00:21:26,616
That's all for today.

334
00:21:26,616 --> 00:21:29,616
It was fun.

335
00:21:29,616 --> 00:21:32,616
I heard that it was the first time I
heard it during the live.

336
00:21:32,616 --> 00:21:35,616
There were a lot of people.

337
00:21:35,616 --> 00:21:37,440
It was a new experience.

338
00:21:37,440 --> 00:21:41,440
I hope you enjoy it.

339
00:21:41,440 --> 00:21:52,922
Thank you for watching.

340
00:21:52,922 --> 00:21:54,602

I hope you enjoy the music video.

345
00:22:11,162 --> 00:22:17,162
I love the song, I want to perform it
live soon.

346
00:22:17,162 --> 00:22:21,162
I want to sing it as soon as possible.

347
00:22:21,162 --> 00:22:26,162
I really want to sing it.

348
00:22:26,162 --> 00:22:29,162
This is the first song.

349
00:22:29,162 --> 00:22:31,168
Thank you for watching.

350
00:22:31,168 --> 00:22:33,168
I wanted it.

351
00:22:33,168 --> 00:22:35,168
But I can't explain it.

352
00:22:37,168 --> 00:22:39,168
What song is it?

353
00:22:39,168 --> 00:22:41,168

354
00:22:41,168 --> 00:22:43,168
Oh, November 20th.

00:22:45,168 --> 00:22:47,168
I'm going to sing this song.

357
00:22:47,168 --> 00:22:49,168
It's amazing.

358
00:22:49,168 --> 00:22:51,168
It's a 10-piece song.

359
00:22:51,168 --> 00:22:53,168

360
00:22:53,168 --> 00:22:55,168

Cute

432
00:27:28,736 --> 00:27:31,736
I was wearing a carry case for Tiori-
chan.

433
00:27:32,736 --> 00:27:34,736
Cute key holder for everyone.

434
00:27:35,736 --> 00:27:43,736
Towel! This towel is a towel fabric that
absorbs moisture well in the pool.

435
00:27:43,736 --> 00:27:45,736
So it's okay to sweat a lot.

436
00:27:46,736 --> 00:27:53,736
T-shirt! I have a little decoration, but
you can also wear it as an over T-shirt.

437
00:27:53,736 --> 00:27:56,240

00:28:41,506 --> 00:28:55,130
Together.

452
00:28:55,130 --> 00:29:00,130
They don't notice me at all.

453
00:29:11,898 --> 00:29:13,898
I can't wait to eat it.

454
00:29:24,250 --> 00:29:26,250
No?

455
00:29:29,250 --> 00:29:33,250

We want to deliver the biggest
excitement to as many people as
possible.

463
00:30:27,042 --> 00:30:32,042
Through this Makuhari Messe, we want to
be a good library that can step up
further.

464
00:30:32,042 --> 00:30:35,042
We want to polish our performance so
that we won't lose to this company.

465
00:30:35,042 --> 00:30:39,042
I'm really looking forward to seeing the
smiles of the 1000-year-old brothers.

466
00:30:39,042 --> 00:30:43,042
I want to make a lot of memories.

467
00:30:43,042 --> 00:30:48,042
I think it would be fun if the six of us
could go to various places.

468
00:30:48,042 --> 00:30:54,042
On October 22nd, let's go! Dokusen
Makuhari!

469
00:31:04,026 --> 00:31:10,026
I'm always crying

470
00:31:10,026 --> 00:31:14,026
I wash away my dirty thoughts

471
00:31:14,026 --> 00:31:18,026
Otherwise, I can't walk

472
00:31:18,026 --> 00:31:23,026
Let's go anywhere

473
00:31:23,026 --> 00:31:27,026
Goodbye goodbye to yesterday

474
00:31:27,026 --> 00:31:31,026
The cityscape after the rain is
sparkling

475
00:31:31,026 --> 00:31:32,506
It's like my heart is...

476
00:31:32,506 --> 00:31:35,506
Everyone, play the sound of the puddle

477
00:31:35,506 --> 00:31:45,434
Play the rainbow piano

478
00:31:45,434 --> 00:31:47,434
Please subscribe to my channel!

479
00:31:47,712 --> 00:31:49,712
I wonder why?

480
00:31:49,712 --> 00:31:55,712
When I smile, it seems like the world is
shining

481
00:31:55,712 --> 00:31:59,712
I can relax by turning the umbrella

482
00:31:59,712 --> 00:32:03,712
Otherwise, I can't walk

483
00:32:03,712 --> 00:32:06,712
Someone is crying somewhere

484
00:32:06,712 --> 00:32:08,712
I'm getting wet somewhere again

485
00:32:08,712 --> 00:32:12,712
Isn't it cold?

486
00:32:12,712 --> 00:32:14,712
Someone is crying somewhere

487
00:32:14,712 --> 00:32:20,712
I want to share my feelings with you

488
00:32:20,712 --> 00:32:24,712
The scenery I don't know before my eyes

489
00:32:24,712 --> 00:32:29,050
Let's go anywhere

490
00:32:29,050 --> 00:32:33,050
Goodbye, goodbye, thank you for
yesterday

491
00:32:33,050 --> 00:32:37,050
The cityscape after the rain has been
colored

492
00:32:37,050 --> 00:32:41,050
I drew a fragment of the future on the
canvas of my heart

493
00:32:41,050 --> 00:33:03,050
It will be filled with the fragments of
the future

494
00:33:03,802 --> 00:33:08,602
I can say it now, even the reason for my
tears

495
00:33:08,602 --> 00:33:12,802
When I'm lost, I immediately remember

496
00:33:12,802 --> 00:33:16,802
Even if it rains, I'll smile

497
00:33:16,802 --> 00:33:20,802
Look, let's go anywhere

498
00:33:20,802 --> 00:33:24,802
Goodbye, goodbye to me from yesterday

499
00:33:24,802 --> 00:33:28,802
The cityscape after the rain is
sparkling

500
00:33:28,802 --> 00:33:30,752
It's like my heart is a clear sky

501
00:33:30,752 --> 00:33:32,752
I play the sound of a rainbow ball

502
00:33:32,752 --> 00:33:36,752
I play the rainbow piano

503
00:33:36,752 --> 00:33:40,752
Goodbye, goodbye to me yesterday

504
00:33:40,752 --> 00:33:44,752
The town after the rain glitters

505
00:33:44,752 --> 00:33:46,752
It's like my heart is a flower

506
00:33:46,752 --> 00:33:48,752
I dry my tears

507
00:33:48,752 --> 00:34:00,752
I wear a rainbow dress
