it.

06:19.698 --> 06:20.698
 I'll eat it with my eyes.

06:21.698 --> 06:22.698
 It looks delicious!

06:23.698 --> 06:25.698
 It smells like butter.

06:25.698 --> 06:26.698
 Look at this!

06:26.698 --> 06:29.698
 Wait a minute!

 Look at this.

07:31.816 --> 07:32.816
 It's a little blue.

07:32.816 --> 07:34.816
 It's a raisin butter.

07:35.816 --> 07:39.816
 It's a raisin that goes well with
butter.

 What I'm going to eat tonight is the
azuki bean flavor of Shimanami Dolce.

11:45.552 --> 11:46.552
 Is it vanilla?

11:46.552 --> 11:47.552
 I'm sad.

11:49.800 --> 11:51.800
 It's like azuki milk.

11:51.800 --> 11:53.800
 Wait, it's good.

 I was like, what?

13:16.010 --> 13:21.010
 I was like, what?

13:21.104 --> 13:25.104
 We sat together until the sun went down

 Every time the wind blows, the scent of
love floats around

13:30.104 --> 13:36.104
 I talked a lot, and the shadows got

15:02.408 --> 15:07.408
 I love you, I miss you

15:07.408 --> 15:10.408
 Every time I think of you like this
