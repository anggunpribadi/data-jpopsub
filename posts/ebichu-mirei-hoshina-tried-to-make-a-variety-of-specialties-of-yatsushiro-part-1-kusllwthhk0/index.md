Shiritsu Ebisu Chugaku Mirei Hoshina cooks using specialties from Yatsushiro City, Kumamoto Prefecture!

This time, we will harvest the strawberries used in cooking at KUROFARM, a farm in Yatsushiro City.
The brand name of strawberries cultivated at KUROFARM is "Ebiberry".
Mr. Hoshina is also surprised by the name that makes him feel connected to Ebichu!
In addition, I will go on a trip to find a cat.

Yatsushiro City Product Attractive Dissemination Project "Yatsushiroya"
Yatsushiro City, Kumamoto Prefecture is the largest producer of special products in Japan, such as rush, tomatoes, and banpei yuzu, which are raw materials for tatami mats. In addition, the rich culture of the Edo period and Hinagu Onsen are also attractive.
One.
On the other hand, the rich nature
It will also be a presence that brings disaster.
Because we live in harmony with nature,
Enjoy the blessings of nature anytime, anywhere
The joy of being able to live in harmony with nature
I would like to propose wisdom to people all over Japan.
