00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Hi everyone, this is Riria Ito and
Minami Umezawa from Nogizaka 46

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:06,672
Thank you for watching!

3
00:00:06,672 --> 00:00:18,672
Today, we are going to introduce
cosmetics and makeup products to you
guys!

4
00:00:19,672 --> 00:00:20,672
I'm so happy!

5
00:00:20,672 --> 00:00:22,672
It's been a while since we last met,
right?

6
00:00:22,672 --> 00:00:25,672
Yeah, it's been a while!

7
00:00:25,672 --> 00:00:29,672
We met when we were in the 3rd
generation of the company.

8
00:00:29,672 --> 00:00:30,672
Yeah, that's true.

9
00:00:30,672 --> 00:00:33,672
So, let's get started!

10
00:00:33,672 --> 00:00:35,672
I'm going to use this.

11
00:00:35,672 --> 00:00:37,672
It's really important to control your
skin.

12
00:00:37,672 --> 00:00:38,672
It's the same!

13
00:00:38,672 --> 00:00:40,672
It's a product that doesn't fall off
even if you drop it from the top.

14
00:00:40,672 --> 00:00:41,672
It's the best!

15
00:00:41,672 --> 00:00:48,314
I know!

16
00:00:48,314 --> 00:01:02,314
We can't show you all of our cosmetics,
but we'll show you what we use.

17
00:01:06,160 --> 00:01:08,160
I don't know what you're talking about.

18
00:01:08,160 --> 00:01:10,160
Can I show you?

19
00:01:10,160 --> 00:01:13,160
This is a strawberry-shaped one.

20
00:01:13,160 --> 00:01:15,160
Oh, I see. This is my base.

21
00:01:15,160 --> 00:01:16,160
I have a lot.

22
00:01:16,160 --> 00:01:17,160
I have a lot.

23
00:01:17,160 --> 00:01:18,160
Really?

24
00:01:18,160 --> 00:01:19,160
I have a lot.

25
00:01:19,160 --> 00:01:21,160
Wow, you have a lot.

26
00:01:21,160 --> 00:01:24,160
It's hard to find.

27
00:01:24,160 --> 00:01:29,160
I think some people put them in one
makeup box.

28
00:01:29,160 --> 00:01:33,160
I put it in a base, eye shadow, and pen
case.

29
00:01:33,160 --> 00:01:37,160
I think it's best to put it in a pen
case.

30
00:01:37,160 --> 00:01:39,160
It's easy to understand.

31
00:01:39,160 --> 00:01:41,160
You can open it and see it.

32
00:01:41,160 --> 00:01:43,160
I'll show you.

33
00:01:43,160 --> 00:01:44,160
How is it?

34
00:01:44,160 --> 00:01:53,160
We're doing the usual recording and
shooting.

35
00:01:53,160 --> 00:01:56,160
Is that different from your usual
private time?

36
00:01:56,160 --> 00:01:57,160
No.

37
00:01:57,160 --> 00:01:58,160
It's different.

38
00:01:58,160 --> 00:02:03,160
It's different from my private time.

39
00:02:03,160 --> 00:02:05,160
There are three types of idols.

40
00:02:05,160 --> 00:02:06,160
There are.

41
00:02:06,160 --> 00:02:10,160
Private, recording, and live.

42
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:12,160
I think it depends on the person.

43
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:18,608
I'll show you the items we usually make.

44
00:02:18,608 --> 00:02:25,608
First, I'll show you the fall and jaw's
protecting foundation primer in 01.

45
00:02:27,608 --> 00:02:28,608
Finally, I did it!

46
00:02:29,608 --> 00:02:30,608
I didn't do it.

47
00:02:30,608 --> 00:02:31,608
You didn't do it, right?

48
00:02:32,608 --> 00:02:35,608
I've been using it a lot, so it's dirty.

49
00:02:35,608 --> 00:02:36,608
Isn't it really popular?

50
00:02:36,608 --> 00:02:46,608
I think the white cap's sunscreen effect
and the skin's makeup breakage are
perfectly balanced.

51
00:02:46,608 --> 00:02:49,608
It moisturizes the skin and doesn't make
the skin dry.

52
00:02:49,608 --> 00:02:52,608
It's a little bit pigmented, so it's
good for the skin.

53
00:02:52,608 --> 00:02:53,608
It's really good.

54
00:02:53,608 --> 00:02:56,608
It changes a little bit just by applying
this.

55
00:02:56,608 --> 00:02:57,608
I understand.

56
00:02:57,608 --> 00:03:05,608
The other one is the one called Bois
Armatifian Ressent.

57
00:03:05,608 --> 00:03:09,608
I use it around the nose and the area
that's easy to move.

58
00:03:09,608 --> 00:03:12,608
It's really smooth.

59
00:03:12,608 --> 00:03:17,608
It's smooth and fills the pores.

60
00:03:17,608 --> 00:03:24,608
It's completely different when you use
it and when you don't.

61
00:03:25,608 --> 00:03:27,608
I love Hatch.

62
00:03:28,608 --> 00:03:30,608
Makeup Base UV

63
00:03:31,608 --> 00:03:32,608
Here it is.

64
00:03:33,608 --> 00:03:36,608
It says it's a sunscreen beauty product.

65
00:03:36,608 --> 00:03:42,608
It's good for summer and it's good for
winter.

66
00:03:42,608 --> 00:03:46,608
I use this and the concealer on my days
off.

67
00:03:46,608 --> 00:03:48,608
It's really gentle.

68
00:03:48,608 --> 00:03:49,608
It's good for the skin.

69
00:03:49,608 --> 00:03:51,608
It's like a beauty product.

70
00:03:51,608 --> 00:03:54,608
It's not a foundation. It's like a skin
care product.

71
00:03:54,608 --> 00:03:55,608
I see.

72
00:03:55,608 --> 00:03:56,608
I highly recommend it.

73
00:03:56,608 --> 00:03:57,608
It's good.

74
00:03:57,608 --> 00:03:58,608
And the base is...

75
00:03:58,608 --> 00:04:00,608
Isn't this really cool?

76
00:04:01,608 --> 00:04:02,608
It's from the brand Sunroller.

77
00:04:02,608 --> 00:04:04,608
I haven't written anything.

78
00:04:04,608 --> 00:04:06,608
Really? You haven't written anything?

79
00:04:06,608 --> 00:04:07,608
No, I haven't.

80
00:04:07,608 --> 00:04:09,608
I'll write it later.

81
00:04:10,608 --> 00:04:11,608
Can I show you the purple one?

82
00:04:11,608 --> 00:04:12,608
Sure.

83
00:04:13,608 --> 00:04:15,608
Can you see the color?

84
00:04:17,608 --> 00:04:20,608
I use this on the center of my cheeks.

85
00:04:20,608 --> 00:04:21,608
Look.

86
00:04:21,608 --> 00:04:22,608
Isn't it cool?

87
00:04:22,608 --> 00:04:23,608
It's amazing.

88
00:04:23,608 --> 00:04:24,608
It's really...

89
00:04:24,608 --> 00:04:25,608
It's very pigmented.

90
00:04:25,608 --> 00:04:26,608
It's white.

91
00:04:26,608 --> 00:04:28,608
It's not weird white.

92
00:04:28,608 --> 00:04:31,608
It's really pretty.

93
00:04:31,608 --> 00:04:32,608
It's amazing.

94
00:04:32,608 --> 00:04:35,608
That's why I often use this as a base.

95
00:04:35,608 --> 00:04:37,608
So this is the base.

96
00:04:37,608 --> 00:04:38,608
This is it.

97
00:04:38,608 --> 00:04:40,608
I can talk for a long time.

98
00:04:40,608 --> 00:04:43,664
It's amazing.

99
00:04:43,664 --> 00:04:51,664
VDL Perfecting Last Foundation V01 Light
Orchid.

100
00:04:51,664 --> 00:04:52,664
I was really curious about this.

101
00:04:52,664 --> 00:04:54,664
This is a hit these days.

102
00:04:54,664 --> 00:04:58,664
It's not sold much in Japanese shops
yet.

103
00:04:58,664 --> 00:05:01,664
This is a hot topic on the Internet.

104
00:05:01,664 --> 00:05:03,664
It's amazing when I tried it.

105
00:05:03,664 --> 00:05:05,664
It's already a group.

106
00:05:05,664 --> 00:05:08,664
I put it out like this, but it's pretty
smooth.

107
00:05:08,664 --> 00:05:12,664
The texture is very smooth and not
heavy.

108
00:05:12,664 --> 00:05:19,664
So even if you apply it, it's smooth.

109
00:05:19,664 --> 00:05:22,664
It's light and sticks well.

110
00:05:22,664 --> 00:05:26,664
I like it because it's not sticky.

111
00:05:26,664 --> 00:05:31,664
I don't have a foundation, but I don't
use it on a daily basis.

112
00:05:31,664 --> 00:05:32,664
Concealer?

113
00:05:32,664 --> 00:05:34,664
Concealer is good.

114
00:05:34,664 --> 00:05:35,664
I love this concealer.

115
00:05:35,664 --> 00:05:37,664
Please take a look.

116
00:05:37,664 --> 00:05:38,664
Ta-da!

117
00:05:38,664 --> 00:05:39,664
It's the same!

118
00:05:39,664 --> 00:05:42,664
There are a lot of people who have this.

119
00:05:42,664 --> 00:05:44,664
There are a lot of members.

120
00:05:44,664 --> 00:05:45,664
The back is amazing.

121
00:05:45,664 --> 00:05:48,664
I don't want to see it.

122
00:05:48,664 --> 00:05:50,664
The middle color is orange.

123
00:05:50,664 --> 00:05:55,664
I put this on the dark circles under my
eyes.

124
00:05:55,664 --> 00:05:59,664
If you layer the skin color that suits
you, you can draw dark circles.

125
00:05:59,664 --> 00:06:02,664
I use a brush that comes with it.

126
00:06:02,664 --> 00:06:05,664
It's a sponge and a brush.

127
00:06:05,664 --> 00:06:10,664
It's really good.

128
00:06:10,664 --> 00:06:13,664
I use a brush to make my face look
bigger.

129
00:06:13,664 --> 00:06:17,664
I apply it to the edge of my lips.

130
00:06:17,664 --> 00:06:21,184
That's really good.

131
00:06:21,184 --> 00:06:27,184
Tada! Makeup Forever Ultra HD Presto
Powder.

132
00:06:27,184 --> 00:06:28,184
That's really good.

133
00:06:28,184 --> 00:06:30,184
This is really good.

134
00:06:30,184 --> 00:06:31,184
I know.

135
00:06:31,184 --> 00:06:33,184
I've been looking for this for a long
time.

136
00:06:33,184 --> 00:06:34,184
It's gone.

137
00:06:34,184 --> 00:06:36,184
It's gone. I have to buy it.

138
00:06:37,184 --> 00:06:41,184
I like the Presto type and there's also
the loose type.

139
00:06:41,184 --> 00:06:43,184
It's already like potato starch.

140
00:06:43,184 --> 00:06:44,184
I know.

141
00:06:44,184 --> 00:06:45,184
I know.

142
00:06:45,184 --> 00:06:46,184
It's really like potato starch.

143
00:06:46,184 --> 00:06:47,184
It's really smooth.

144
00:06:47,184 --> 00:06:49,184
It's really smooth.

145
00:06:49,184 --> 00:06:51,184
It doesn't break easily.

146
00:06:51,184 --> 00:06:52,184
It's amazing.

147
00:06:52,184 --> 00:06:54,184
I want to make it matte.

148
00:06:54,184 --> 00:06:58,184
I like the type that adds gloss with
highlights later.

149
00:06:58,184 --> 00:07:00,184
I'll make it really matte.

150
00:07:00,184 --> 00:07:01,184
I know.

151
00:07:01,184 --> 00:07:03,184
I bought this recently.

152
00:07:03,184 --> 00:07:05,184
It's pretty recent.

153
00:07:05,184 --> 00:07:08,184
VT Shika No Sebum Mild Powder.

154
00:07:09,184 --> 00:07:12,184
This is also sold at drugstores.

155
00:07:12,184 --> 00:07:13,184
I bought it at drugstores.

156
00:07:13,184 --> 00:07:14,184
I see.

157
00:07:14,184 --> 00:07:16,184
It's Shika.

158
00:07:16,184 --> 00:07:17,184
It's really good.

159
00:07:17,184 --> 00:07:19,184
This is also really like potato starch.

160
00:07:19,184 --> 00:07:21,184
It's really like potato starch.

161
00:07:21,184 --> 00:07:23,184
It doesn't dry out.

162
00:07:23,184 --> 00:07:25,184
It's potato starch.

163
00:07:25,184 --> 00:07:27,184
It's really like potato starch.

164
00:07:27,184 --> 00:07:30,184
It's a compliment word for potato starch
powder.

165
00:07:30,184 --> 00:07:32,184
If you put this on, it fills up your
pores.

166
00:07:32,184 --> 00:07:33,184
I see.

167
00:07:34,184 --> 00:07:35,184
It's beautiful.

168
00:07:35,184 --> 00:07:37,184
It's smooth.

169
00:07:37,184 --> 00:07:39,184
It's affordable.

170
00:07:39,184 --> 00:07:40,184
It's easy to get.

171
00:07:40,184 --> 00:07:42,184
It's good.

172
00:07:42,184 --> 00:07:44,184
It's amazing that it contains Shika.

173
00:07:44,184 --> 00:07:47,184
I thought Shika powder was really good.

174
00:07:47,184 --> 00:07:50,816
I'm curious.

175
00:07:50,816 --> 00:07:52,816
Eye makeup is the best.

176
00:07:52,816 --> 00:07:54,816
I should go with the base.

177
00:07:54,816 --> 00:07:56,816
I talked too much.

178
00:07:56,816 --> 00:07:58,816
What should I do first?

179
00:07:58,816 --> 00:08:00,816
I will start with eyebrows.

180
00:08:00,816 --> 00:08:02,816
This is the new eyebrow pencil.

181
00:08:04,816 --> 00:08:06,816
This is so thin.

182
00:08:06,816 --> 00:08:08,816
I'm surprised.

183
00:08:08,816 --> 00:08:10,816
It's as thin as a somen noodle.

184
00:08:12,816 --> 00:08:14,816
It's easy to draw.

185
00:08:14,816 --> 00:08:16,816
It's easy to draw.

186
00:08:16,816 --> 00:08:18,816
It's cheap.

187
00:08:18,816 --> 00:08:20,816
It's cheap.

188
00:08:20,816 --> 00:08:22,816
I will draw my eyebrows.

189
00:08:22,816 --> 00:08:24,816
I introduced this on Instagram.

190
00:08:24,816 --> 00:08:26,816
This and this.

191
00:08:26,816 --> 00:08:28,816
I don't know.

192
00:08:28,816 --> 00:08:30,816
I don't know.

193
00:08:30,816 --> 00:08:32,816
I will ask the staff.

194
00:08:32,816 --> 00:08:34,816
I have this at home.

195
00:08:34,816 --> 00:08:36,816
I like this whitish color.

196
00:08:36,816 --> 00:08:38,816
I know.

197
00:08:38,816 --> 00:08:40,816
I don't know this color.

198
00:08:40,816 --> 00:08:42,816
I know.

199
00:08:42,816 --> 00:08:44,816
I found this at the drug store.

200
00:08:44,816 --> 00:08:46,816
I found this at the drug store.

201
00:08:46,816 --> 00:08:52,816
Brow Lash EX Water Strong Double Eyebrow
Pencil and Liquid Natural Brown

202
00:08:52,816 --> 00:08:54,816
Pencil and Liquid

203
00:08:54,816 --> 00:08:56,816
This is not a cap.

204
00:08:56,816 --> 00:08:58,816
This is not a cap.

205
00:08:58,816 --> 00:09:00,816
I lost it.

206
00:09:00,816 --> 00:09:02,816
This is not a cap.

207
00:09:02,816 --> 00:09:04,816
This is a pencil.

208
00:09:04,816 --> 00:09:06,816
This is a pencil.

209
00:09:06,816 --> 00:09:08,816
This is a liquid.

210
00:09:08,816 --> 00:09:10,816
It's good to have a liquid.

211
00:09:10,816 --> 00:09:14,816
There are many products that have a
pencil and powder.

212
00:09:14,816 --> 00:09:16,816
This has a liquid and a pencil.

213
00:09:16,816 --> 00:09:18,816
I know.

214
00:09:18,816 --> 00:09:20,816
I know.

215
00:09:20,816 --> 00:09:22,816
This is good.

216
00:09:22,816 --> 00:09:26,816
This liquid is good for eye bags.

217
00:09:26,816 --> 00:09:28,816
This is good for eye bags.

218
00:09:28,816 --> 00:09:30,816
This is good for eye bags.

219
00:09:30,816 --> 00:09:34,816
This is also at the drug store.

220
00:09:34,816 --> 00:09:38,816
Kiss Me Heavy Rotation Coloring Eyebrow
05 Light Brown

221
00:09:38,816 --> 00:09:42,816
I've been using this since I was in high
school.

222
00:09:42,816 --> 00:09:44,816
I've been using this since I was in high
school.

223
00:09:44,816 --> 00:09:46,816
I know.

224
00:09:46,816 --> 00:09:48,816
I've been using this too.

225
00:09:48,816 --> 00:09:50,816
It's easy to use because it's easy to
dye.

226
00:09:50,816 --> 00:09:52,816
The color is really good.

227
00:09:52,816 --> 00:09:54,816
It's easy to use.

228
00:09:54,816 --> 00:09:56,816
My eyebrows are really beautiful.

229
00:09:56,816 --> 00:09:58,816
Eyebrows are very important.

230
00:09:58,816 --> 00:10:00,816
I thought red-pink was the point of my
eyebrows.

231
00:10:00,816 --> 00:10:02,816
I thought red-pink was the point of my
eyebrows.

232
00:10:02,816 --> 00:10:04,816
What's next?

233
00:10:04,816 --> 00:10:06,816
Eyeline

234
00:10:06,816 --> 00:10:08,816
This is 09.

235
00:10:08,816 --> 00:10:10,816
I have other colors.

236
00:10:10,816 --> 00:10:12,816
I'm using this 09 today.

237
00:10:12,816 --> 00:10:14,816
It's really easy to draw.

238
00:10:14,816 --> 00:10:18,816
Just a little touch will give you color.

239
00:10:18,816 --> 00:10:20,816
I'm really weird.

240
00:10:20,816 --> 00:10:22,816
How to draw eyeliner

241
00:10:22,816 --> 00:10:24,816
This is the corner of the eye.

242
00:10:24,816 --> 00:10:26,816
Here.

243
00:10:26,816 --> 00:10:28,816
Only here.

244
00:10:28,816 --> 00:10:30,816
I only draw this part of the corner of
the eye.

245
00:10:30,816 --> 00:10:32,816
I see.

246
00:10:32,816 --> 00:10:34,816
If you make this part higher,

247
00:10:34,816 --> 00:10:36,816
The corner of the eye will be lower.

248
00:10:36,816 --> 00:10:38,816
So

249
00:10:38,816 --> 00:10:40,816
The shape of the eye will be a little
droopy.

250
00:10:40,816 --> 00:10:42,816
I know.

251
00:10:42,816 --> 00:10:44,816
So

252
00:10:44,816 --> 00:10:46,816
I only draw this part of the eye.

253
00:10:46,816 --> 00:10:48,816
I see.

254
00:10:48,816 --> 00:10:50,816
I'm calculating.

255
00:10:50,816 --> 00:10:52,816
I use one eyeliner.

256
00:10:52,816 --> 00:10:54,816
Heroine Make Smooth Liquid Eyeliner

257
00:10:54,816 --> 00:10:56,816
Heroine Make Smooth Liquid Eyeliner

258
00:10:56,816 --> 00:10:58,816
Super Keep

259
00:10:58,816 --> 00:11:00,816
Heroine Make is a super keep.

260
00:11:00,816 --> 00:11:02,816
Heroine Make is a super keep.

261
00:11:02,816 --> 00:11:04,816
The color is black brown.

262
00:11:04,816 --> 00:11:06,816
It's really good.

263
00:11:06,816 --> 00:11:08,816
It doesn't fall.

264
00:11:08,816 --> 00:11:10,816
During the construction of the building,

265
00:11:10,816 --> 00:11:12,816
It was the hit time of the location.

266
00:11:12,816 --> 00:11:14,816
It's a waterfall.

267
00:11:14,816 --> 00:11:16,816
It was the hit time.

268
00:11:16,816 --> 00:11:18,816
It's usually falling.

269
00:11:18,816 --> 00:11:20,816
I was perfect.

270
00:11:20,816 --> 00:11:22,816
It's true.

271
00:11:22,816 --> 00:11:24,816
It's the strongest.

272
00:11:24,816 --> 00:11:26,816
It's too strong as a selling point.

273
00:11:26,816 --> 00:11:28,816
Besides falling from a waterfall,

274
00:11:28,816 --> 00:11:30,816
Is there a way to fall?

275
00:11:30,816 --> 00:11:32,816
It's the strongest.

276
00:11:32,816 --> 00:11:34,816
I recommend it.

277
00:11:34,816 --> 00:11:36,816
I understand the heroine make.

278
00:11:36,816 --> 00:11:38,816
Next,

279
00:11:38,816 --> 00:11:40,816
I introduced various things.

280
00:11:40,816 --> 00:11:42,816
Live

281
00:11:42,816 --> 00:11:44,816
We often perform live.

282
00:11:44,816 --> 00:11:46,816
Live is a little different from usual.

283
00:11:46,816 --> 00:11:48,816
Live is a little different from usual.

284
00:11:48,816 --> 00:11:50,816
Stage make

285
00:11:50,816 --> 00:11:52,816
It's a makeup that makes it gorgeous.

286
00:11:52,816 --> 00:11:54,816
I'll show you the items I use there.

287
00:11:54,816 --> 00:11:56,816
I'll show you the items I use there.

288
00:11:56,816 --> 00:11:58,816
I'll show you the items I use there.

289
00:11:58,816 --> 00:12:00,816
Some people look at me with��us.

290
00:12:00,816 --> 00:12:02,816
I'll give you a solid.

291
00:12:02,816 --> 00:12:04,816
I'll give you a solid.

292
00:12:04,816 --> 00:12:06,816
blood scene

293
00:12:06,816 --> 00:12:08,816
I can show you the eyebrows complete.

294
00:12:08,816 --> 00:12:10,816
I will.

295
00:12:10,816 --> 00:12:12,816
It's like the lighting.

296
00:12:12,816 --> 00:12:14,816
You can see it perfectly.

297
00:12:14,816 --> 00:12:16,816
I used a vehicles number for lighting.

298
00:12:16,816 --> 00:12:18,816
It's like the lighting.

299
00:12:18,816 --> 00:12:20,816
I can put tools.

300
00:12:20,816 --> 00:12:22,816
You can stick time.

301
00:12:22,816 --> 00:12:24,816
Yes

302
00:12:24,816 --> 00:12:26,816
It's a makeup that won't stick too much.

303
00:12:26,816 --> 00:12:29,416
Makeup that can be taken on but hold a
little

304
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:37,120
First, I'll use the KINGDOM CURL Mascara
CB.

305
00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:40,120
This is amazing.

306
00:12:40,120 --> 00:12:42,120
This is really good.

307
00:12:42,120 --> 00:12:45,120
It's called a bubble-like mascara.

308
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:47,120
You can create a bubble-like effect just
by applying it.

309
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:51,120
This is also interesting. You can apply
it on both sides.

310
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:52,120
It's true.

311
00:12:52,120 --> 00:12:53,120
It's rough and fine.

312
00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:54,120
Yes, yes, yes.

313
00:12:54,120 --> 00:12:56,120
I'll apply this.

314
00:12:56,120 --> 00:12:59,120
I can't show you this face.

315
00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:01,120
It's no good.

316
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:04,120
It's being applied with a fine comb.

317
00:13:04,120 --> 00:13:07,120
Yes, I just applied it.

318
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:09,120
I applied it here.

319
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:11,120
Look at this.

320
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:15,120
Can you see the bubble effect?

321
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:17,120
Wow, it's beautiful.

322
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:18,120
It's really beautiful.

323
00:13:18,120 --> 00:13:19,120
It doesn't get in the way.

324
00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:20,120
It doesn't get in the way at all.

325
00:13:20,120 --> 00:13:26,120
If you apply this on a rough comb,

326
00:13:26,120 --> 00:13:29,120
it creates a bubble effect.

327
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:31,120
Look at this.

328
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:32,120
Can you see it?

329
00:13:32,120 --> 00:13:33,120
Look at this.

330
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:34,120
Isn't it amazing?

331
00:13:34,120 --> 00:13:35,120
It looks like a fake eyelashes.

332
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:36,120
Yes, yes, yes.

333
00:13:36,120 --> 00:13:38,120
I didn't apply it here.

334
00:13:38,120 --> 00:13:39,120
It's really good.

335
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:40,120
It's really good.

336
00:13:40,120 --> 00:13:43,120
You can create a bubble effect just by
applying it.

337
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:44,120
It's really good.

338
00:13:44,120 --> 00:13:45,120
Yes, it's good.

339
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:46,120
I'll buy it.

340
00:13:46,120 --> 00:13:47,120
I'll buy it.

341
00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:48,120
Really.

342
00:13:48,120 --> 00:13:51,120
Next, I'll apply glitter.

343
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:52,120
Ta-da.

344
00:13:52,120 --> 00:13:54,120
There are many of them.

345
00:13:54,120 --> 00:13:59,120
I'll apply these two together.

346
00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:08,120
First, I'll apply this glitter from
Licorice Lash on the corner of my eye
bags.

347
00:14:08,120 --> 00:14:10,120
Like this.

348
00:14:10,120 --> 00:14:12,120
I applied it.

349
00:14:12,120 --> 00:14:13,120
Oh, it's cute.

350
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:14,120
It's glittery.

351
00:14:14,120 --> 00:14:19,120
I applied it here because I usually
apply it on my makeup.

352
00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:20,120
Yes, it's glittery.

353
00:14:20,120 --> 00:14:23,120
And, can you see it?

354
00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:27,120
There are many big and small glitter.

355
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:32,120
I'll find this big glitter.

356
00:14:32,120 --> 00:14:39,120
I'll apply it on the corner of my eye
bags.

357
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:43,120
Can you see it?

358
00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:44,120
Look at this.

359
00:14:44,120 --> 00:14:45,120
I applied it.

360
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:46,120
I applied it.

361
00:14:46,120 --> 00:14:57,120
By applying glitter, you don't want to
make your tear bags glittery, but you
can make your eyes glittery by
reflecting it on the light.

362
00:14:57,120 --> 00:14:58,120
I see.

363
00:14:58,120 --> 00:15:00,120
It's really good.

364
00:15:00,120 --> 00:15:06,120
I'll apply it on the corner of my eye
bags.

365
00:15:06,120 --> 00:15:07,120
It's done.

366
00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:08,120
It's cute.

367
00:15:08,120 --> 00:15:11,120
Next, I'll make my upper eyelid
glittery.

368
00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:15,120
This is 3CE's Minimalty Eye Color
Palette.

369
00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:17,120
It's glittery.

370
00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:18,120
It's glittery.

371
00:15:18,120 --> 00:15:19,120
Amazing.

372
00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:25,120
It's glittery.

373
00:15:25,120 --> 00:15:26,120
Amazing.

374
00:15:26,120 --> 00:15:27,120
Amazing.

375
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:28,120
I just put my finger on it.

376
00:15:28,120 --> 00:15:30,120
You just put your finger on it.

377
00:15:30,120 --> 00:15:36,120
I'll apply it on the upper part of my
eye bags.

378
00:15:36,120 --> 00:15:40,120
I'll apply it on the upper part of my
eye bags.

379
00:15:40,120 --> 00:15:42,120
Look at this.

380
00:15:42,120 --> 00:15:44,120
My face is glittery.

381
00:15:44,120 --> 00:15:45,120
It's amazing even if you like it.

382
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:46,120
It's amazing even if you like it.

383
00:15:46,120 --> 00:15:48,120
Next, I'll apply blush.

384
00:15:48,120 --> 00:15:53,120
This is L'Avimero's Enchant Glow Blush
Cheek.

385
00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:54,120
Look at this.

386
00:15:54,120 --> 00:15:55,120
Look at this.

387
00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:56,120
Isn't the color so cute?

388
00:15:56,120 --> 00:15:57,120
It's cute.

389
00:15:57,120 --> 00:16:00,120
It contains pearl.

390
00:16:00,120 --> 00:16:05,120
People who don't like pearl blushes have
this color.

391
00:16:05,120 --> 00:16:07,120
I'll apply a little bit of blush on the
cheek.

392
00:16:07,120 --> 00:16:08,120
It's a little bit dark.

393
00:16:08,120 --> 00:16:09,120
I see.

394
00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:12,120
It's a little bit dark.

395
00:16:12,120 --> 00:16:14,120
It's cute.

396
00:16:14,120 --> 00:16:16,120
It's a little bit pink.

397
00:16:16,120 --> 00:16:18,120
It's not that dark.

398
00:16:18,120 --> 00:16:19,120
The color is pretty.

399
00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:22,120
It makes my skin look white.

400
00:16:22,120 --> 00:16:24,120
Lastly, I'll apply lipstick.

401
00:16:24,120 --> 00:16:28,120
This is Doton Lip Plus.

402
00:16:28,120 --> 00:16:30,120
This is a plumper.

403
00:16:30,120 --> 00:16:35,120
This is the highest level of Grand
Master.

404
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:40,120
I asked the members of the third
generation to try this on.

405
00:16:40,120 --> 00:16:43,120
They were screaming when I put it on.

406
00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:44,120
Is it a lip balm?

407
00:16:44,120 --> 00:16:45,120
It's the best.

408
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:46,120
It hurts.

409
00:16:46,120 --> 00:16:50,120
It's like eating spicy ramen.

410
00:16:50,120 --> 00:16:51,120
This is transparent.

411
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:54,120
I'll apply this.

412
00:16:54,120 --> 00:16:57,120
I'll apply it like this.

413
00:16:57,120 --> 00:17:00,120
If you don't like pain, don't try this.

414
00:17:00,120 --> 00:17:01,120
I don't think it's good for you.

415
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:05,120
I think it contains a lot of capsaicin.

416
00:17:05,120 --> 00:17:07,120
I'm surprised.

417
00:17:07,120 --> 00:17:09,120
It hurts.

418
00:17:09,120 --> 00:17:12,120
It makes your lips look good.

419
00:17:12,120 --> 00:17:14,120
It makes your lips look plump.

420
00:17:14,120 --> 00:17:17,120
I like it very much.

421
00:17:17,120 --> 00:17:19,120
Then I'll apply lip balm.

422
00:17:19,120 --> 00:17:25,120
This is KATE's Lip Monster AM2.

423
00:17:25,120 --> 00:17:27,120
I don't know the name.

424
00:17:27,120 --> 00:17:31,120
Lip Monster is the best.

425
00:17:31,120 --> 00:17:33,120
This is a reddish color.

426
00:17:33,120 --> 00:17:34,120
It's cute.

427
00:17:34,120 --> 00:17:36,120
I use a reddish color.

428
00:17:36,120 --> 00:17:38,120
It doesn't fall off.

429
00:17:38,120 --> 00:17:40,120
It doesn't fall off.

430
00:17:40,120 --> 00:17:48,154
It's good.

431
00:17:48,154 --> 00:17:50,154
It's a good color, isn't it?

432
00:17:50,154 --> 00:17:52,154
It's good, isn't it? It's very easy to
use.

433
00:17:52,154 --> 00:17:53,154
It's like this.

434
00:17:53,154 --> 00:17:58,154
But what's good is that the color is
good, but it doesn't fall off.

435
00:17:58,154 --> 00:17:59,154
It's the best.

436
00:17:59,154 --> 00:18:00,154
It's the best.

437
00:18:00,154 --> 00:18:03,154
Well, my live is like this.

438
00:18:03,154 --> 00:18:04,154
Yeah.

439
00:18:04,154 --> 00:18:05,154
It's gorgeous.

440
00:18:05,154 --> 00:18:06,154
It feels good.

441
00:18:06,154 --> 00:18:07,154
Yeah.

442
00:18:08,154 --> 00:18:09,154
It's like this.

443
00:18:09,154 --> 00:18:10,154
It's cute.

444
00:18:10,154 --> 00:18:11,154
It's flashy.

445
00:18:11,154 --> 00:18:12,154
The face.

446
00:18:12,154 --> 00:18:15,776
It's good.

447
00:18:15,776 --> 00:18:17,776
I'm going to do it.

448
00:18:17,776 --> 00:18:23,776
I use eyeshadow a little darker than
usual.

449
00:18:23,776 --> 00:18:24,776
I see.

450
00:18:24,776 --> 00:18:26,776
I use the one I always use.

451
00:18:26,776 --> 00:18:28,776
I feel like I'm applying it a little
darker.

452
00:18:28,776 --> 00:18:30,776
Can you see the difference?

453
00:18:30,776 --> 00:18:32,776
Certainly.

454
00:18:32,776 --> 00:18:35,776
Right and left.

455
00:18:35,776 --> 00:18:37,776
I'll do it right now.

456
00:18:37,776 --> 00:18:39,776
It's different.

457
00:18:39,776 --> 00:18:41,776
It's completely different, isn't it?

458
00:18:41,776 --> 00:18:43,776
It's completely different.

459
00:18:43,776 --> 00:18:45,776
I draw the line longer.

460
00:18:45,776 --> 00:18:47,776
I see.

461
00:18:47,776 --> 00:18:49,776
Lower the eyeliner once.

462
00:18:49,776 --> 00:18:51,776
I'll raise it.

463
00:18:51,776 --> 00:18:55,776
Do you know the inner corner of the eye?

464
00:18:55,776 --> 00:18:57,776
What?

465
00:18:57,776 --> 00:18:59,776
I know.

466
00:18:59,776 --> 00:19:01,776
Isn't it completely different?

467
00:19:01,776 --> 00:19:05,776
I think the eyeshadow on the corner of
the eye is important.

468
00:19:05,776 --> 00:19:09,776
It's like a black eyeliner.

469
00:19:09,776 --> 00:19:13,776
I'll draw the line a little lower.

470
00:19:13,776 --> 00:19:15,776
I see.

471
00:19:15,776 --> 00:19:17,776
I'll draw it a little.

472
00:19:17,776 --> 00:19:19,776
I'll draw it here.

473
00:19:19,776 --> 00:19:21,776
I see.

474
00:19:21,776 --> 00:19:23,776
Please blur it immediately.

475
00:19:23,776 --> 00:19:25,776
It's important.

476
00:19:25,776 --> 00:19:29,776
I have to blur it quickly because the
white makeup won't fall off.

477
00:19:29,776 --> 00:19:33,776
Blur it immediately.

478
00:19:33,776 --> 00:19:35,776
It makes the eye look bigger.

479
00:19:35,776 --> 00:19:37,776
It's true.

480
00:19:37,776 --> 00:19:41,776
I usually apply mascara twice.

481
00:19:41,776 --> 00:19:45,776
I can apply it twice.

482
00:19:45,776 --> 00:19:47,776
I'll do my best.

483
00:19:47,776 --> 00:19:49,776
I don't want to see this.

484
00:19:49,776 --> 00:19:51,776
I'm a little embarrassed.

485
00:19:51,776 --> 00:19:53,776
I'll apply mascara.

486
00:19:53,776 --> 00:19:55,776
I'll apply mascara.

487
00:19:55,776 --> 00:19:57,776
I'll apply mascara.

488
00:19:57,776 --> 00:19:59,776
I'll apply mascara.

489
00:19:59,776 --> 00:20:01,776
Is that a volume type?

490
00:20:01,776 --> 00:20:03,776
Today is a volume type.

491
00:20:03,776 --> 00:20:05,776
I think it's a volume type.

492
00:20:05,776 --> 00:20:07,776
I think it's a lot.

493
00:20:07,776 --> 00:20:09,776
Isn't it completely different?

494
00:20:09,776 --> 00:20:11,776
It's completely different.

495
00:20:11,776 --> 00:20:13,776
Your eyelashes are very good.

496
00:20:13,776 --> 00:20:15,776
I also apply mascara.

497
00:20:15,776 --> 00:20:17,776
I'll apply the eye shadow of the
addiction.

498
00:20:17,776 --> 00:20:21,776
This is also cute.

499
00:20:21,776 --> 00:20:23,776
It's very cute.

500
00:20:23,776 --> 00:20:25,776
It's sparkling.

501
00:20:25,776 --> 00:20:27,776
Look at this.

502
00:20:27,776 --> 00:20:29,776
I'll apply it here.

503
00:20:29,776 --> 00:20:33,776
I want it here.

504
00:20:33,776 --> 00:20:37,776
I often apply it with my fingers.

505
00:20:37,776 --> 00:20:39,776
Apply it here.

506
00:20:39,776 --> 00:20:43,776
I like this shining eye.

507
00:20:43,776 --> 00:20:47,776
This is beautiful when the lighting
hits.

508
00:20:47,776 --> 00:20:51,776
I can see it very well.

509
00:20:51,776 --> 00:20:53,776
It's true.

510
00:20:53,776 --> 00:20:57,776
It's important.

511
00:20:57,776 --> 00:21:01,776
This is the shimmer liquid highlighter
01.

512
00:21:01,776 --> 00:21:03,776
This is really beautiful.

513
00:21:03,776 --> 00:21:07,776
This is my favorite highlighter.

514
00:21:07,776 --> 00:21:09,776
I'll apply it to the highest part of my
cheek.

515
00:21:09,776 --> 00:21:11,776
It's deep.

516
00:21:11,776 --> 00:21:13,776
This is it.

517
00:21:13,776 --> 00:21:15,776
This is it.

518
00:21:15,776 --> 00:21:17,776
This is important.

519
00:21:17,776 --> 00:21:19,776
This is important.

520
00:21:19,776 --> 00:21:21,776
This is important.

521
00:21:21,776 --> 00:21:23,776
This is important.

522
00:21:23,776 --> 00:21:25,776
Do you understand?

523
00:21:25,776 --> 00:21:27,776
Under the eyebrows.

524
00:21:27,776 --> 00:21:29,776
On the eyebrows.

525
00:21:29,776 --> 00:21:31,776
On the chin.

526
00:21:31,776 --> 00:21:33,776
On the chin.

527
00:21:33,776 --> 00:21:37,776
This is the highlight of the high
master.

528
00:21:37,776 --> 00:21:39,776
This is beautiful.

529
00:21:39,776 --> 00:21:41,776
I also have a lip.

530
00:21:41,776 --> 00:21:43,776
This is the number 04 pumpkin.

531
00:21:43,776 --> 00:21:47,776
I use this when I record a live show.

532
00:21:47,776 --> 00:21:51,776
This is a matte version.

533
00:21:51,776 --> 00:21:53,776
I want this.

534
00:21:53,776 --> 00:21:55,776
I hope you can buy it.

535
00:21:55,776 --> 00:21:57,776
I've been using drugstore products.

536
00:21:57,776 --> 00:21:59,776
I don't have it.

537
00:21:59,776 --> 00:22:01,776
I sometimes go to your drugstore.

538
00:22:01,776 --> 00:22:05,776
I found it and bought it.

539
00:22:05,776 --> 00:22:07,776
I use this.

540
00:22:07,776 --> 00:22:11,776
Rouge unlimited liquid matte.

541
00:22:11,776 --> 00:22:13,776
RD 04.

542
00:22:13,776 --> 00:22:15,776
I use this red color.

543
00:22:15,776 --> 00:22:25,776
I'm applying this red color to the
inside of the pumpkin.

544
00:22:25,776 --> 00:22:27,776
This is the inside of the pumpkin.

545
00:22:27,776 --> 00:22:29,776
This is cute.

546
00:22:29,776 --> 00:22:31,776
I apply this to make it look more
gorgeous.

547
00:22:31,776 --> 00:22:33,776
This is a plus.

548
00:22:33,776 --> 00:22:35,776
This is cute.

549
00:22:35,776 --> 00:22:37,776
This is cute.

550
00:22:37,776 --> 00:22:41,776
I use this for the last time.

551
00:22:41,776 --> 00:22:43,776
This is a fix makeup.

552
00:22:43,776 --> 00:22:45,776
This is important.

553
00:22:45,776 --> 00:22:47,776
This is important.

554
00:22:47,776 --> 00:22:49,776
This is the end.

555
00:22:49,776 --> 00:22:51,776
This is the end.

556
00:22:51,776 --> 00:22:53,776
This is beautiful.

557
00:22:53,776 --> 00:22:55,776
This is beautiful.

This is beautiful.

559
00:22:57,776 --> 00:22:59,776
This really changes the mood.

560
00:22:59,776 --> 00:23:01,776
This was the makeup of the alpha.

561
00:23:01,776 --> 00:23:03,776
This is the end.

562
00:23:03,776 --> 00:23:07,776
I introduced various products.

563
00:23:07,776 --> 00:23:09,776
How was it?

564
00:23:09,776 --> 00:23:11,776
I haven't introduced it yet.

565
00:23:11,776 --> 00:23:13,776
I don't know.

566
00:23:13,776 --> 00:23:15,776
I brought a lot of products.

567
00:23:15,776 --> 00:23:17,776
I brought a lot of products.

568
00:23:17,776 --> 00:23:19,776
I brought a big bag.

569
00:23:19,776 --> 00:23:23,776
I'm glad I had this opportunity.

570
00:23:23,776 --> 00:23:27,776
I often get questions from female fans.

571
00:23:27,776 --> 00:23:29,776
I'm glad I was able to do it.

572
00:23:29,776 --> 00:23:31,776
I want to make it a series.

573
00:23:31,776 --> 00:23:33,776
I want to do it.

574
00:23:33,776 --> 00:23:35,776
Please.

575
00:23:35,776 --> 00:23:41,776
Please subscribe to the channel and like
it.

576

Bye bye.
