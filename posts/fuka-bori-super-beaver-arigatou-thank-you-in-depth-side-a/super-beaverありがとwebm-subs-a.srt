1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,660
I can only say it now.

2
00:00:01,660 --> 00:00:05,960
The way you overcame like and dislike is
dirty.

3
00:00:05,960 --> 00:00:08,800
That's right. You can't be caught by
touch.

4
00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:22,106
It's like Super Beaver's music.

5
00:00:22,106 --> 00:00:24,106
Please come in.

6
00:00:25,106 --> 00:00:27,106
Nice to meet you.

7
00:00:27,106 --> 00:00:28,106
It's been a while.

8
00:00:28,106 --> 00:00:29,106
Nice to meet you.

9
00:00:29,106 --> 00:00:31,106
You two are so cool.

10
00:00:31,106 --> 00:00:32,106
Nice to meet you.

11
00:00:32,106 --> 00:00:34,106
Nice to meet you.

12
00:00:34,106 --> 00:00:36,106
I'd like to hear your story.

13
00:00:36,106 --> 00:00:37,106
Please.

14
00:00:37,106 --> 00:00:38,106
Nice to meet you.

15
00:00:38,106 --> 00:00:46,298
Please.

16
00:00:46,298 --> 00:00:48,298
Thank you.

17
00:00:59,642 --> 00:01:04,642
Thank you for finding me

18
00:01:04,642 --> 00:01:07,642
Thank you for accepting me

19
00:01:07,642 --> 00:01:11,398
Thank you for loving me

20
00:01:11,398 --> 00:01:15,398
Thank you for remembering me

21
00:01:15,398 --> 00:01:18,398
Thank you for taking care of me

22
00:01:18,398 --> 00:01:21,398
Thank you for being important to me

23
00:01:21,398 --> 00:01:28,398
Thank you for loving me

24
00:01:28,398 --> 00:01:32,398
Thank you for taking care of me

25
00:01:32,398 --> 00:01:37,398
Thank you for taking care of me

26
00:01:37,398 --> 00:01:42,398
I'm glad I met you

27
00:01:42,398 --> 00:01:47,398
It's so obvious that it's not good

28
00:01:47,398 --> 00:01:51,398
But hey, I have to say it

29
00:01:51,398 --> 00:01:54,398
Thank you for loving me

30
00:01:54,398 --> 00:01:58,298
Thank you for loving me

31
00:01:58,298 --> 00:02:02,298
The band you chose this time was
Arigato.

32
00:02:03,298 --> 00:02:06,298
Yonagisawa-san, who wrote the lyrics,

33
00:02:06,298 --> 00:02:14,298
did you feel the same way when you wrote
Arigato?

34
00:02:14,298 --> 00:02:18,298
Yes, the reason I chose this song is

35
00:02:18,298 --> 00:02:23,760
because I knew what kind of band Super
Viva was.

36
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:30,760
I thought it was a song that I could
understand various aspects of the band.

37
00:02:30,760 --> 00:02:32,760
At the time, I was very simple.

38
00:02:32,760 --> 00:02:35,760
I was just finishing my first major
debut.

39
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:39,760
I was on my own for two years.

40
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:43,760
There were four members and I was doing
various things.

41
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:46,760
I was going around the live show.

42
00:02:46,760 --> 00:02:48,624
And when it was LORDN Έ de D darling
villageın SAEkill

43
00:02:48,624 --> 00:02:51,824
I was thinking about what kind of song
to sing.

44
00:02:51,824 --> 00:02:55,624
I remember that if I could sing the word
thank you in a simple way,

45
00:02:55,624 --> 00:03:00,624
I could express the current Super
Beaver.

46
00:03:00,624 --> 00:03:04,424
I remember that conversation.

47
00:03:04,424 --> 00:03:06,624
At first, it was a very small
opportunity.

48
00:03:06,624 --> 00:03:09,824
I was thinking about what would happen
if I used the words I usually use,

49
00:03:09,824 --> 00:03:13,824
but I was thinking about what I thought
I would do now.

50
00:03:13,824 --> 00:03:16,752
I was grateful that I thought about it
and made it.

51
00:03:16,752 --> 00:03:22,152
And in the lyrics, there's a lot of
thanks.

52
00:03:22,152 --> 00:03:29,752
At that time, I thought about what to
thank for.

53
00:03:29,752 --> 00:03:32,752
I've been thinking a lot about it.

54
00:03:32,752 --> 00:03:37,008
That was the first reason why this song
was made.

55
00:03:37,008 --> 00:03:45,008
It's been 17 years since Super Weaver,
but I think it's a band that has been
supported by many people until the 17th
year.

56
00:03:45,008 --> 00:03:53,008
That's our pride, and when we think back
on the honor of being able to come this
far,

57
00:03:53,008 --> 00:03:59,008
it's because we like the activities
we've done so far that a lot of people's
faces come to mind.

58
00:03:59,008 --> 00:04:04,848
When I think about the people who have
supported us, I think of them one by
one.

59
00:04:04,848 --> 00:04:09,848
I want to say thank you so much that the
variation of this song is not enough.

60
00:04:09,848 --> 00:04:10,848
That's true.

61
00:04:10,848 --> 00:04:11,848
There are so many.

62
00:04:11,848 --> 00:04:13,848
It depends on the person.

63
00:04:13,848 --> 00:04:14,848
That's right.

64
00:04:14,848 --> 00:04:16,848
The way the song sounds.

65
00:04:16,848 --> 00:04:20,848
After all, we have been on stage many
times.

66
00:04:20,848 --> 00:04:23,848
Of course, the same scenery is not
always the same.

67
00:04:23,848 --> 00:04:27,848
The feelings we have at that time are
also different.

68
00:04:27,848 --> 00:04:34,848
There are times when I feel grateful for
the song, but I don't feel good about
it.

69
00:04:38,810 --> 00:04:42,810
It's a simple message from a simple
name.

70
00:04:42,810 --> 00:04:50,810
When I made this demo, I was not
confident in saying thank you in
Hiragana's title.

71
00:04:50,810 --> 00:04:52,810
I wrote thank you in Roman.

72
00:04:52,810 --> 00:04:56,810
I remember sending the demo to the
members.

73
00:04:56,810 --> 00:05:01,776
When I finished, I still use this as a
super Viva.

74
00:05:01,776 --> 00:05:09,376
I was still shy enough to be able to
sing it as one song.

75
00:05:09,456 --> 00:05:11,456
That shyness was the reason.

76
00:05:11,456 --> 00:05:13,456
It was a thank you to the Roman Empire.

77
00:05:13,456 --> 00:05:15,456
It was a bit of a joke.

78
00:05:15,456 --> 00:05:16,456
There's a saying,

79
00:05:16,456 --> 00:05:19,456
The Roman Empire is a cataclysmic
cataclysm.

80
00:05:19,456 --> 00:05:16,936
It's like a little bit of a

81
00:05:16,936 --> 00:05:20,456
It's like a little bit of a

82
00:05:20,456 --> 00:05:21,456
It's like a little bit of a

83
00:05:21,456 --> 00:05:22,456
It's like a little bit of a

84
00:05:22,456 --> 00:05:25,456
If you're going to put the essence into
it,

85
00:05:25,456 --> 00:05:27,456
Even at the demo stage,

86
00:05:27,456 --> 00:05:29,456
Don't write it like this.

87
00:05:29,456 --> 00:05:31,456
It's a straight line.

88
00:05:31,456 --> 00:05:33,456
That's the way the thank you is.

89
00:05:33,456 --> 00:05:35,456
That's the way it is.

90
00:05:35,456 --> 00:05:38,208
It's better to shoot it properly.

91
00:05:38,208 --> 00:05:43,208
I think it's a good word to say.

92
00:05:43,208 --> 00:05:44,408
That's right.

93
00:05:44,408 --> 00:05:49,308
I think it's a word that you can't hear
in bad words.

94
00:05:49,308 --> 00:05:53,608
Considering the stance we can do,

95
00:05:53,608 --> 00:05:57,308
I don't think we can do anything else.

96
00:05:57,308 --> 00:05:59,376
It doesn't be fun to do it quickly.

97
00:05:59,376 --> 00:06:04,976
You can try various things by looking at
the tree, or take a pose from various
angles.

98
00:06:04,976 --> 00:06:07,816
I'm sure those who can do it can do it.

99
00:06:07,816 --> 00:06:09,816
Have you tried it?

100
00:06:09,816 --> 00:06:10,816
I have.

101
00:06:10,816 --> 00:06:14,816
I've done it, but I'm not into it.

102
00:06:14,816 --> 00:06:18,016
In short, it doesn't appear on the
surface as a form.

103
00:06:18,016 --> 00:06:20,816
There was a time when I wanted to do it
like this.

104
00:06:20,816 --> 00:06:25,200
I thought that this kind of music that
is popular now would be like this.

105
00:06:25,200 --> 00:06:31,200
I've tried to incorporate it, but in the
end it doesn't feel good.

106
00:06:31,200 --> 00:06:33,200
I think that's all we have.

107
00:06:33,200 --> 00:06:39,200
So what's on the table now is all our
stance.

108
00:06:39,200 --> 00:06:45,200
That's what I just shot out.

109
00:06:45,200 --> 00:06:51,696
I want to convey what suits me in a
realistic way.

110
00:06:51,696 --> 00:06:55,696
Oil painting allows me to become a Brian
environmentalist and director.

111
00:06:55,696 --> 00:06:59,696
Otherwise it won't look like I've made
things up properly.

112
00:06:59,696 --> 00:07:03,696
Mil parabens were also a result of
adding a character into my work.

113
00:07:03,696 --> 00:07:03,984
I wanted to be lighting up the
foundations and beginning with feeling
the face.

114
00:07:03,984 --> 00:07:11,544
The words you use when you give it
meaning are what brings you to reality.

115
00:07:11,544 --> 00:07:13,524
That's why its consumers' daily
Computers.

116
00:07:13,524 --> 00:07:14,624
They understand what you're talking
about.

117
00:07:14,624 --> 00:07:16,164
They speak to you with carries in mind.

118
00:07:16,164 --> 00:07:26,864
I guess the reason why itís not suitable
sheep's ajuss is because you're
profesional,

119
00:07:26,864 --> 00:07:30,336
hence what you cour to reluctant to use.

120
00:07:30,336 --> 00:07:35,336
The reason I chose this song is quite
big.

121
00:07:35,336 --> 00:07:39,336
When I was able to appear in various
events little by little,

122
00:07:39,336 --> 00:07:47,336
I was able to express the words of
gratitude with my voice and sound.

123
00:07:47,336 --> 00:07:56,336
When I expressed it from the stage, I
felt that the way I liked it or hated it
was so dirty.

124
00:07:56,336 --> 00:07:59,472
I was able to feel it in this song.

125
00:07:59,472 --> 00:08:03,472
Until then, when there were many people
who performed aggressively,

126
00:08:03,472 --> 00:08:08,472
we thought we should try to sell a lot
of aggressive songs to the setlist.

127
00:08:08,472 --> 00:08:12,472
There were times when we thought that
way.

128
00:08:12,472 --> 00:08:17,472
Now, I remember the song that Super
Beaver was proud of

129
00:08:17,472 --> 00:08:21,472
and was able to sing with his feet on
the ground.

130
00:08:21,472 --> 00:08:27,744
I remember the song that made me think
of myself.

131
00:08:27,744 --> 00:08:31,584
I was healthy such as that Super Viva
live performance

132
00:08:31,744 --> 00:08:37,364
that Shibuya cooked for me in charge of
at my live performance,

133
00:08:37,364 --> 00:08:39,364
I feel very sorry for him.

134
00:08:43,418 --> 00:08:46,418
I think it's great that Shibuya says,

135
00:08:46,418 --> 00:08:53,418
Thank you now, not later.

136
00:08:53,418 --> 00:08:56,418
Because we've been working together for
a long time,

137
00:08:56,418 --> 00:09:01,418
I think it's a band that knows that
there are few things that can be done by
ourselves.

138
00:09:01,418 --> 00:09:05,418
I saw the face of the person on the
floor on the stage,

139
00:09:05,418 --> 00:09:09,504
and I saw the will of the person who
tried to make this day.

140
00:09:09,504 --> 00:09:13,504
When I think about it, the words that
only come out at that time,

141
00:09:13,504 --> 00:09:16,504
like thank you, come out with you.

142
00:09:16,504 --> 00:09:24,504
If you feel that, you can only say it
now, thinking that you can only say it
now.

143
00:09:24,504 --> 00:09:28,416
Really, you should say it now.

144
00:09:28,416 --> 00:09:35,136
I've been connected to it, not just on
stage.

145
00:09:35,136 --> 00:09:37,536
Not just on stage.

146
00:09:37,536 --> 00:09:43,136
There are so many moments in life and in
daily life.

147
00:09:43,136 --> 00:09:46,176
I've been self-aware of it every time I
sing.

148
00:09:46,176 --> 00:09:49,696
I've been self-aware of it with the
members.

149
00:09:49,696 --> 00:09:56,096
I was inspired by the words of Shibuya,
who was born.

150
00:09:56,096 --> 00:09:56,256
I was inspired by the words of Shibuya,
who was born.

151
00:09:56,256 --> 00:10:02,856
感じたりとかするってことがまた自分の作曲だったり作詞に
活かされるってこともあるわけですよね。

152
00:10:02,856 --> 00:10:13,756
そうですね。ちょうど、MCから言葉をそのまま歌詞にピックアップして
入れ始めたのがちょうどありがとうとかのあたりで。

153
00:10:13,756 --> 00:10:19,536
同じアルバムにあなたっていう楽曲も入ってるんですけど、
あなたっていうのもそれぐらいの時期に

154
00:10:19,536 --> 00:10:23,040
シビアが明確にあなたたちじゃなくあなたに歌ってる。

155
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:26,040
This is really wonderful.

156
00:10:26,040 --> 00:10:30,040
Until then, I didn't really care about
it.

157
00:10:30,040 --> 00:10:32,040
I used to use the word, you, in my
second album.

158
00:10:32,040 --> 00:10:35,040
Well, I used to sing the word, you,
depending on the song.

159
00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:40,224
I'll try to change everything to you.

160
00:10:40,224 --> 00:10:44,724
That's how I started writing songs.

161
00:10:44,724 --> 00:10:47,024
It was a word that came from Shibuya.

162
00:10:47,024 --> 00:10:54,724
The fact that I changed it to you later
on was another moment of Super Beaver.

163
00:10:54,724 --> 00:11:01,724
It's a song I wrote, but it's a word of
Super Beaver and a word of Shibuya
Ryuta.

164
00:11:01,724 --> 00:11:06,864
The words I used on stage were more
intense than ever before.

165
00:11:06,864 --> 00:11:09,864
I thought I was getting more and more
inspired by the music.

166
00:11:09,864 --> 00:11:17,864
That's how much I've been using the
words on stage.

167
00:11:17,864 --> 00:11:20,864
I've been listening to them all the
time,

168
00:11:20,864 --> 00:11:24,864
so sometimes I can't hear them all.

169
00:11:24,864 --> 00:11:28,864
But there are words that come to mind.

170
00:11:28,864 --> 00:11:32,864
That's what I'm excited about right now.

171
00:11:32,864 --> 00:11:36,096
When I make a song, I'm really...

172
00:11:36,096 --> 00:11:45,596
I've been thinking about how to make
music that's literally Super Beaver's
words.

173
00:11:45,596 --> 00:11:47,096
When you guys are on stage, you're like,

174
00:11:47,096 --> 00:11:50,096
Oh, there's someone in here.

175
00:11:50,096 --> 00:11:52,096
You're just thinking about it.

176
00:11:52,096 --> 00:11:54,096
But when you're called,

177
00:11:54,096 --> 00:11:56,096
Oh, it's me.

178
00:11:56,096 --> 00:11:59,096
I'm also excited when I say this myself.

179
00:11:59,096 --> 00:12:01,096
I thought I'd tell you this.

180
00:12:01,096 --> 00:12:04,992
There's almost nothing I want to do on
stage.

181
00:12:04,992 --> 00:12:11,552
But when I was singing, I wanted to
deliver more.

182
00:12:11,552 --> 00:12:15,712
But I wondered what I should do to
deliver more.

183
00:12:15,712 --> 00:12:19,552
It's like a pre-school reunion in
elementary school.

184
00:12:19,552 --> 00:12:25,792
The reason why I can't get into the
principal's story.

185
00:12:25,792 --> 00:12:28,592
Why I wasn't interested in it.

186
00:12:28,592 --> 00:12:30,912
Why I don't remember anything.

187
00:12:30,912 --> 00:12:32,400
gew.

188
00:12:32,400 --> 00:12:37,200
I thought they were looking at us as a
group.

189
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:41,960
I thought it was thin because I was
looking at them as a group.

190
00:12:41,960 --> 00:12:53,000
I thought that the words that were 100%
were divided into the number of people
in the group, so it was getting thinner
and thinner.

191
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:56,400
When I wanted to deliver more and more,
it floated.

192
00:12:56,400 --> 00:13:00,040
I thought, that's right. You shouldn't
be taken by the touch.

193
00:13:00,040 --> 00:13:01,728
I'm singing to you.

194
00:13:01,728 --> 00:13:06,728
I thought that if I clearly thought and
clearly said that,

195
00:13:06,728 --> 00:13:11,728
I thought that maybe they would listen
to the music more,

196
00:13:11,728 --> 00:13:15,728
or they would feel more comfortable.

197
00:13:15,728 --> 00:13:18,728
Since we were four people playing
together,

198
00:13:18,728 --> 00:13:21,728
and we realized that it wasn't just the
four of us,

199
00:13:21,728 --> 00:13:25,728
I thought that I had to deliver the
message,

200
00:13:25,728 --> 00:13:31,728
and that I had to deliver it.

201
00:13:35,546 --> 00:13:45,546
Do you feel any changes in the way the
audience has changed over the years?

202
00:13:45,546 --> 00:13:51,546
I don't think the audience has changed
much.

203
00:13:51,546 --> 00:13:57,546
I think the audience has felt different
depending on the song.

204
00:13:57,546 --> 00:14:02,546
We haven't changed in the way we
perform.

205
00:14:02,546 --> 00:14:04,560
But, as I thought...

206
00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:10,560
I felt that the people who were watching
me were doing their best.

207
00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:16,560
They were watching me from the floor.

208
00:14:16,560 --> 00:14:21,560
That was a chance for me to realize
that.

209
00:14:21,560 --> 00:14:26,560
I think music is not just about you.

210
00:14:26,560 --> 00:14:30,528
You have your own way of listening.

211
00:14:30,528 --> 00:14:33,528
No matter how much you admire it,

212
00:14:33,528 --> 00:14:36,528
there are people who are staring at it.

213
00:14:36,528 --> 00:14:39,528
I think it was a tempo that raised your
fist.

214
00:14:39,528 --> 00:14:44,528
There are people who are the only one
who are proud and raising their fists.

215
00:14:44,528 --> 00:14:49,528
When I started doing this song called
Thank you,

216
00:14:49,528 --> 00:14:53,528
I was personally very aware of that.

217
00:14:53,528 --> 00:14:56,528
What are the people who listen to it?

218
00:14:56,528 --> 00:14:56,832
Thank you.

219
00:14:56,832 --> 00:15:02,832
I think that's what they thought about
me at the live show.

220
00:15:02,832 --> 00:15:04,832
I was very impressed.

221
00:15:04,832 --> 00:15:08,832
I'm originally a person who goes to the
live show.

222
00:15:08,832 --> 00:15:12,832
I always talk a lot with the members.

223
00:15:12,832 --> 00:15:16,832
But since such people sing and deliver
it,

224
00:15:16,832 --> 00:15:24,832
I think that kind of atmosphere is cool.

225
00:15:24,832 --> 00:15:26,832
I think that was very good.

226
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:29,360
It's important to be accepted.

227
00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:31,360
I think it's important to be accepted.

228
00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:35,360
I've always been a fan of music.

229
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:39,360
I've never thought I was a player.

230
00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:43,360
I'm a player, but I've never thought I
was a player.

231
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:45,360
I've always been a fan of music.

232
00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:51,504
I've always been a fan of music.

233
00:15:51,504 --> 00:15:53,504
I think I understand.

234
00:15:53,504 --> 00:16:00,504
I think it's natural that this song
changed the music of this song,

235
00:16:00,504 --> 00:16:05,504
but I think the people who received it
changed because they changed themselves.

236
00:16:05,504 --> 00:16:14,504
I think I'm going to betray the attitude
of trying to convey it seriously to the
gentleman,

237
00:16:14,504 --> 00:16:20,112
but I think it will reach the people who
are listening to it.

238
00:16:20,112 --> 00:16:29,112
I think no one will listen to the story
of a person who is just doing it somehow
and trying to convey it somehow, but

239
00:16:29,112 --> 00:16:38,112
I want you to really understand, I
really want to convey it, I really
think, everyone will listen to the story
of the person who is seriously saying
it.

240
00:16:38,112 --> 00:16:41,184
I think that's what I like about music.

241
00:16:41,184 --> 00:16:52,184
I think that the music is only stuck in
the music of someone who seriously loves
that music and seriously throws it.

242
00:16:52,184 --> 00:16:57,184
I think that stance is very important.

243
00:16:57,184 --> 00:17:06,184
I think it's very important to face each
other sincerely and to do what we're
doing seriously and seriously.

244
00:17:06,184 --> 00:17:11,088
So, from this song, we can do that.

245
00:17:11,088 --> 00:17:13,088
I think that's how it has become.

246
00:17:13,088 --> 00:17:15,088
So, I think that the people who are
watching this

247
00:17:15,088 --> 00:17:17,088
are listening to it seriously,

248
00:17:17,088 --> 00:17:19,088
and they are genuinely enjoying it.

249
00:17:19,088 --> 00:17:21,088
That's what I thought.

250
00:17:21,088 --> 00:17:23,088
It's a good starting point.

251
00:17:23,088 --> 00:17:25,088
Well, not starting point,

252
00:17:25,088 --> 00:17:27,088
it's not that it changed suddenly,

253
00:17:27,088 --> 00:17:29,088
but it's a good start.

254
00:17:29,088 --> 00:17:31,088
We've been doing that all the time.

255
00:17:31,088 --> 00:17:33,088
But, I have a feeling

256
00:17:33,088 --> 00:17:42,881
that it's not going to be as good as it
was before.
