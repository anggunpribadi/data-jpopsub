2
00:00:03,290 --> 00:00:05,290
Nice! Wait, it's close!

3
00:00:05,290 --> 00:00:07,290
Will it go in?

4
00:00:09,290 --> 00:00:11,290
Wow!

5
00:00:11,290 --> 00:00:13,290
Nice shot!

6
00:00:13,290 --> 00:00:17,290
Where did it go?

7
00:00:19,336 --> 00:00:21,336
Wait, you're so good!

8
00:00:25,336 --> 00:00:27,336
Hello! It's been a while!

9
00:00:27,336 --> 00:00:29,336
Were you surprised?

10
00:00:29,336 --> 00:00:31,336
I'm Hina Kiguchi!

11
00:00:33,336 --> 00:00:38,336
I graduated, but I played golf last
time.

12
00:00:38,336 --> 00:00:43,336
I'm doing it again as a continuation.

13
00:00:43,336 --> 00:00:48,336
Today, I'm visiting Aoyama Park 9.

14
00:00:48,336 --> 00:00:55,336
I'm going to try simulation golf for the
first time.

15
00:00:55,336 --> 00:00:58,336
I have a special guest here.

16
00:00:58,336 --> 00:01:00,336
Namiki!

17
00:01:02,336 --> 00:01:04,336
Hello, everyone! I'm Namiki.

18
00:01:04,336 --> 00:01:05,336
Nice to meet you.

19
00:01:05,336 --> 00:01:08,336
Nice to meet you, too.

20
00:01:08,336 --> 00:01:10,336
Nice to meet you, too.

21
00:01:10,336 --> 00:01:12,336
I'm so happy.

22
00:01:12,336 --> 00:01:15,336
I saw you playing golf on the video.

23
00:01:15,336 --> 00:01:17,336
You're so good at it.

24
00:01:17,336 --> 00:01:18,336
I'm so happy.

25
00:01:18,336 --> 00:01:19,336
I was surprised.

26
00:01:19,336 --> 00:01:24,336
I'm so embarrassed because I don't know
anything.

27
00:01:24,336 --> 00:01:28,336
I watched your YouTube.

28
00:01:28,336 --> 00:01:29,336
Thank you.

29
00:01:29,336 --> 00:01:32,336
It's easy for beginners to understand.

30
00:01:32,336 --> 00:01:34,336
I'm going to do my best.

31
00:01:34,336 --> 00:01:37,336
I'm going to do a collaboration.

32
00:01:37,336 --> 00:01:39,336
Thank you.

33
00:01:39,336 --> 00:01:41,336
I'll do my best.

34
00:01:41,336 --> 00:01:43,336
Let's do it!

35
00:01:49,216 --> 00:01:54,216
Let's start the simulation golf.

36
00:01:54,216 --> 00:01:56,216
Let's enjoy it.

37
00:01:56,216 --> 00:01:58,216
Higuchi is very nervous.

38
00:01:58,216 --> 00:02:01,216
I'm not a professional or anything.

39
00:02:01,216 --> 00:02:03,216
I'm just an amateur.

40
00:02:03,216 --> 00:02:05,216
I'm not a professional.

41
00:02:05,216 --> 00:02:08,216
I'm just a beginner.

42
00:02:08,216 --> 00:02:12,216
I'll enjoy it while you help me.

43
00:02:12,216 --> 00:02:14,216
Let's start.

44
00:02:14,216 --> 00:02:15,216
Yes.

45
00:02:15,216 --> 00:02:16,216
Please.

46
00:02:16,216 --> 00:02:17,216
I'm nervous.

47
00:02:17,216 --> 00:02:20,216
The first hole is par 4.

48
00:02:20,216 --> 00:02:23,216
The release is 286 yards.

49
00:02:23,216 --> 00:02:25,216
It says to the pin.

50
00:02:25,216 --> 00:02:26,216
It's straight at first.

51
00:02:26,216 --> 00:02:29,216
I think it's okay if you don't put it in
the pond.

52
00:02:29,216 --> 00:02:34,216
Let's go.

53
00:02:34,650 --> 00:02:36,650
What will she say?

54
00:02:37,650 --> 00:02:38,650
OK! OK!

55
00:02:39,650 --> 00:02:41,650
OK! OK!

56
00:02:41,650 --> 00:02:43,650
Nice shot!

57
00:02:44,416 --> 00:02:46,416
Is it good?

58
00:02:46,416 --> 00:02:48,416
First nice shot!

59
00:02:50,416 --> 00:02:52,416
What should I call you?

60
00:02:52,416 --> 00:02:54,416
I was wondering about it.

61
00:02:54,416 --> 00:02:57,416
Well, Hina or Hina-chan.

62
00:02:57,416 --> 00:02:59,416
Anything is fine.

63
00:02:59,416 --> 00:03:00,416
Anything is fine?

64
00:03:00,416 --> 00:03:01,416
Then, Hina-chan.

65
00:03:01,416 --> 00:03:02,416
What should I call you?

66
00:03:02,416 --> 00:03:03,416
Anything is fine.

67
00:03:03,416 --> 00:03:04,416
Namiki-san.

68
00:03:04,416 --> 00:03:06,416
Why is that?

69
00:03:06,416 --> 00:03:08,416
Namiki-chan.

70
00:03:08,416 --> 00:03:10,416
I'll call you Namiki-san.

71
00:03:10,416 --> 00:03:12,416
Or should I call you Namiki-nee-san?

72
00:03:12,416 --> 00:03:14,416
Anything is fine.

73
00:03:14,416 --> 00:03:15,416
I'll call you Namiki-nee-san.

74
00:03:15,416 --> 00:03:17,416
Then, Hina-chan.

75
00:03:17,416 --> 00:03:23,416
I shot a driver for the first time and I
got a scar.

76
00:03:23,416 --> 00:03:26,800
I watched that video.

77
00:03:27,800 --> 00:03:29,800
She is a little bit nervous.

78
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:33,800
I feel I've learned it so far.

79
00:03:33,800 --> 00:03:35,800
It's just fear.

80
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:38,800
It's OK. I'll do my best.

81
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:39,800
I'll do my best.

82
00:03:39,800 --> 00:03:40,800
I'll do my best.

83
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:41,800
I'll do my best.

84
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:42,704
I'm scared. I'm scared.

85
00:03:43,704 --> 00:03:44,704
It's okay.

86
00:03:44,704 --> 00:03:46,704
Please slip once.

87
00:03:46,704 --> 00:03:47,704
Yes.

88
00:03:47,704 --> 00:03:49,704
No matter how many times you slip.

89
00:03:49,704 --> 00:03:52,704
I'm scared. I'm not going to hit the
bottom.

90
00:03:53,704 --> 00:03:56,704
I'll do my best not to get into the
pond.

91
00:03:56,704 --> 00:03:59,952
Yes.

92
00:04:00,952 --> 00:04:02,952
Wow! Nice hit!

93
00:04:02,952 --> 00:04:04,952
This is totally fine.

94
00:04:04,952 --> 00:04:05,952
See?

95
00:04:06,952 --> 00:04:08,952
Nice!

96
00:04:09,952 --> 00:04:14,952
Hina, you hit 157 yards to the pin.

97
00:04:14,952 --> 00:04:18,952
I don't know how it is at first.

98
00:04:18,952 --> 00:04:21,952
But I think you still have a long way to
go.

99
00:04:21,952 --> 00:04:22,952
Yes, I do.

100
00:04:22,952 --> 00:04:28,952
You can use this to hit a club you are
good at or a club you have practiced.

101
00:04:28,952 --> 00:04:35,952
I use this driver and iron 7.

102
00:04:35,952 --> 00:04:38,952
I only use this.

103
00:04:38,952 --> 00:04:40,952
You have never used this wood or
utility?

104
00:04:40,952 --> 00:04:43,952
I have, but I couldn't hit it at all.

105
00:04:43,952 --> 00:04:48,952
Then, you should use the one you are
confident with.

106
00:04:48,952 --> 00:04:49,952
Yes.

107
00:04:50,952 --> 00:04:52,952
Your swing is really beautiful.

108
00:04:52,952 --> 00:04:53,952
I'm glad.

109
00:04:53,952 --> 00:04:55,952
You are called by my sister.

110
00:04:55,952 --> 00:05:01,008
I'm called by my sister.

111
00:05:02,008 --> 00:05:04,008
Nice! OK OK OK!

112
00:05:04,008 --> 00:05:07,008
If you roll at the beginning, it's OK.

113
00:05:07,008 --> 00:05:09,008
Nice!

114
00:05:10,008 --> 00:05:15,008
I usually hit the 8th iron at 100 yards.

115
00:05:15,008 --> 00:05:18,008
I want to hit the 8th iron.

116
00:05:26,008 --> 00:05:27,008
What will happen?

117
00:05:27,008 --> 00:05:29,008
Don't hit the bunker!

118
00:05:29,008 --> 00:05:30,906
Stop!

119
00:05:30,906 --> 00:05:32,906
She got it!

120
00:05:32,906 --> 00:05:35,906
I can't say, nice!

121
00:05:35,906 --> 00:05:37,906
It's not about flying.

122
00:05:37,906 --> 00:05:38,906
It's difficult.

123
00:05:38,906 --> 00:05:41,906
It's important to be sure.

124
00:05:41,906 --> 00:05:42,906
I see.

125
00:05:42,906 --> 00:05:44,906
Hina's strategy is very good.

126
00:05:44,906 --> 00:05:45,906
Really?

127
00:05:45,906 --> 00:05:46,906
Slowly?

128
00:05:46,906 --> 00:05:48,906
That's the most important.

129
00:05:48,906 --> 00:05:50,906
Hina's strategy

130
00:05:51,906 --> 00:05:52,906
Nice!

131
00:05:53,906 --> 00:05:54,906
She might get it!

132
00:05:54,906 --> 00:05:55,906
This is it!

133
00:05:55,906 --> 00:05:56,906
Nice!

134
00:05:56,906 --> 00:05:57,906
Wait, it's close!

135
00:05:57,906 --> 00:06:00,906
Will she get it?

136
00:06:02,394 --> 00:06:04,394
Yay!

137
00:06:04,394 --> 00:06:06,394
You're good!

138
00:06:06,394 --> 00:06:09,394
Nice!

139
00:06:09,690 --> 00:06:10,690
I might land it!

140
00:06:10,690 --> 00:06:11,690
Roll!

141
00:06:11,690 --> 00:06:12,690
Nice!

142
00:06:12,690 --> 00:06:13,690
Wait, it's close!

143
00:06:13,690 --> 00:06:14,690
Will it go in?

144
00:06:16,690 --> 00:06:17,690
Oh my god!

145
00:06:17,690 --> 00:06:19,690
You're so good!

146
00:06:19,690 --> 00:06:20,690
I'm so happy!

147
00:06:20,690 --> 00:06:22,690
You can just hit it with a putter next
time.

148
00:06:22,690 --> 00:06:23,690
I see.

149
00:06:23,690 --> 00:06:25,690
Just roll it with a putter.

150
00:06:25,690 --> 00:06:27,690
That's difficult.

151
00:06:27,690 --> 00:06:28,690
Nice!

152
00:06:28,690 --> 00:06:31,690
You're at 14.2 yards.

153
00:06:33,690 --> 00:06:34,690
This is difficult.

154
00:06:34,690 --> 00:06:40,690
I'll try 58 degrees.

155
00:06:41,914 --> 00:06:43,914
Wow, it's big! Stop!

156
00:06:44,914 --> 00:06:45,914
Hang in there!

157
00:06:46,914 --> 00:06:48,914
It didn't go in. The green didn't go in.

158
00:06:48,914 --> 00:06:49,914
I'll try again.

159
00:06:50,914 --> 00:06:51,914
It didn't go in.

160
00:06:52,914 --> 00:06:56,914
The ball went to the right in the front,
and to the left in the back.

161
00:06:56,914 --> 00:06:57,914
That's right.

162
00:06:58,914 --> 00:07:00,914
I can't hit the ball because of this.

163
00:07:00,914 --> 00:07:09,530
I'll try again.

164
00:07:09,530 --> 00:07:11,530
Oh, it's weak.

165
00:07:12,530 --> 00:07:15,530
It's weak, but it's rolling slowly.

166
00:07:15,530 --> 00:07:17,530
It's going well, isn't it?

167
00:07:17,530 --> 00:07:20,530
It's going well.

168
00:07:21,530 --> 00:07:22,530
Next.

169
00:07:23,530 --> 00:07:24,530
Oh, it's me again.

170
00:07:25,530 --> 00:07:27,530
That means Hina is close.

171
00:07:27,530 --> 00:07:28,530
Is that so?

172
00:07:30,530 --> 00:07:32,530
I have to do my best.

173
00:07:32,530 --> 00:07:33,530
I'll do my best.

174
00:07:33,530 --> 00:07:35,530
What will happen?

175
00:07:38,530 --> 00:07:40,530
Please enter.

176
00:07:40,530 --> 00:07:41,530
Please.

177
00:07:41,530 --> 00:07:43,530
I couldn't enter.

178
00:07:44,058 --> 00:07:46,058
Amazing!

179
00:07:46,480 --> 00:07:47,480
That's a lot of fun!

180
00:07:47,480 --> 00:07:49,480
We're almost there.

181
00:07:49,480 --> 00:07:52,480
I've got a double bogey.

182
00:07:52,480 --> 00:07:56,480
Hina, if you get this in, you'll be a
par.

183
00:07:56,480 --> 00:07:58,480
I'll do my best.

184
00:07:58,480 --> 00:08:00,480
There's a chance.

185
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:02,480
You can see the slope.

186
00:08:02,480 --> 00:08:04,480
What do you think, Hina?

187
00:08:04,480 --> 00:08:05,480
This slope...

188
00:08:05,480 --> 00:08:07,480
Which way do you think it's going to
turn?

189
00:08:07,480 --> 00:08:10,480
It's going to turn right.

190
00:08:10,480 --> 00:08:11,480
That's right.

191
00:08:11,480 --> 00:08:16,480
Then, be aware of the right.

192
00:08:16,480 --> 00:08:21,370
Here we go.

193
00:08:21,370 --> 00:08:24,992
Good?

194
00:08:24,992 --> 00:08:25,992
Huh?

195
00:08:25,992 --> 00:08:27,992
Sorry, that was an error.

196
00:08:27,992 --> 00:08:28,992
I didn't react.

197
00:08:28,992 --> 00:08:29,992
Oh, you're right.

198
00:08:29,992 --> 00:08:31,992
Sorry, thank you.

199
00:08:31,992 --> 00:08:32,992
Huh?

200
00:08:32,992 --> 00:08:33,992
What?

201
00:08:33,992 --> 00:08:36,992
The score is higher than the distance.

202
00:08:36,992 --> 00:08:40,992
The one with the higher score is the
winner.

203
00:08:40,992 --> 00:08:42,992
I'm glad.

204
00:08:42,992 --> 00:08:43,992
I'm the winner.

205
00:08:43,992 --> 00:08:45,992
I didn't expect you to be the winner.

206
00:08:45,992 --> 00:08:46,992
I know.

207
00:08:46,992 --> 00:08:48,992
So the distance doesn't matter.

208
00:08:48,992 --> 00:08:52,992
By the way, this is the next part.

209
00:08:52,992 --> 00:08:55,992
So if you score 3 points, you'll get a
point.

210
00:08:55,992 --> 00:08:58,992
The pin is written there, but it's only
127 degrees.

211
00:08:58,992 --> 00:09:00,992
Oh, really.

212
00:09:00,992 --> 00:09:01,992
I'll do my best.

213
00:09:01,992 --> 00:09:04,992
How far can you jump?

214
00:09:04,992 --> 00:09:06,992
I don't know yet.

215
00:09:06,992 --> 00:09:08,992
Let's go.

216
00:09:08,992 --> 00:09:12,762
Please subscribe to this channel.

217
00:09:13,342 --> 00:09:15,082
You can 對 this turn!

218
00:09:15,242 --> 00:09:16,022
Really?

219
00:09:16,242 --> 00:09:17,782
You can go straight.

220
00:09:17,982 --> 00:09:19,762
A three-perfect shot is fine.

221
00:09:20,122 --> 00:09:21,302
It's also short.

222
00:09:21,682 --> 00:09:22,262
Research!

223
00:09:22,422 --> 00:09:23,002
Yes!

224
00:09:23,622 --> 00:09:27,862
My turn is a U-turn in six.

225
00:09:28,022 --> 00:09:31,022
I'll shoot straight.

226
00:09:33,462 --> 00:09:35,062
Amazing!

227
00:09:35,262 --> 00:09:36,162
Straight!

228
00:09:36,302 --> 00:09:37,802
What?

229
00:09:38,342 --> 00:09:38,784
Obrigado!

230
00:09:39,784 --> 00:09:40,784
Nice!

231
00:09:41,784 --> 00:09:42,784
This is really good!

232
00:09:44,784 --> 00:09:45,784
Thank you!

233
00:09:47,784 --> 00:09:48,784
I'm happy!

234
00:09:49,784 --> 00:09:50,784
I showed you a good side of me!

235
00:09:52,784 --> 00:09:54,784
I'm so happy to see you so happy in the
first try!

236
00:09:55,784 --> 00:09:56,784
The second try

237
00:09:56,784 --> 00:09:58,784
OK! OK!

238
00:10:00,280 --> 00:10:01,280
OK! OK!

239
00:10:01,280 --> 00:10:03,280
You are moving forward.

240
00:10:03,280 --> 00:10:04,280
I'm glad.

241
00:10:04,280 --> 00:10:05,280
You are doing great.

242
00:10:05,280 --> 00:10:06,280
Thank you.

243
00:10:06,280 --> 00:10:10,280
I thought I was doing well at first.

244
00:10:10,280 --> 00:10:13,280
But, golf is a sport where you make
mistakes.

245
00:10:13,280 --> 00:10:17,280
So, please think that there are few
secrets.

246
00:10:17,280 --> 00:10:20,280
You are so kind.

247
00:10:20,280 --> 00:10:22,280
The third try

248
00:10:23,280 --> 00:10:24,280
OK!

249
00:10:24,280 --> 00:10:25,280
You did it!

250
00:10:25,280 --> 00:10:26,280
Nice!

251
00:10:26,280 --> 00:10:27,280
Stop! Stop!

252
00:10:27,280 --> 00:10:29,280
Stop!

253
00:10:29,306 --> 00:10:31,546
Ah! But if it's this...

254
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:33,840
How is it? I think you can do it with a
putter.

255
00:10:33,840 --> 00:10:35,100
Really?

256
00:10:35,100 --> 00:10:35,840
I'll have to see.

257
00:10:35,840 --> 00:10:37,840
If you stop a little more in front...

258
00:10:37,840 --> 00:10:38,840
What will you do?

259
00:10:38,840 --> 00:10:40,840
I'll try a putter.

260
00:10:41,840 --> 00:10:43,840
How does this slope look?

261
00:10:43,840 --> 00:10:45,840
It's a little down.

262
00:10:45,840 --> 00:10:47,840
Oh, yes. It's a little downhill.

263
00:10:47,840 --> 00:10:52,840
Downhill, front right, back left.

264
00:10:52,840 --> 00:10:54,840
Oh, that's it.

265
00:10:54,840 --> 00:10:55,840
Oh, great.

266
00:10:55,840 --> 00:10:56,840
Aiming for the straight.

267
00:10:56,840 --> 00:11:00,840
However, there is only downhill, so be
careful.

268
00:11:00,840 --> 00:11:02,840
That's great.

269
00:11:02,840 --> 00:11:04,840
I'll try to be as strong as I can.

270
00:11:04,840 --> 00:11:06,840
Aim for the straight.

271
00:11:09,272 --> 00:11:10,272
I think I went too far.

272
00:11:10,272 --> 00:11:11,272
It's OK. You're doing good.

273
00:11:11,272 --> 00:11:12,272
Go, go, go!

274
00:11:12,272 --> 00:11:13,272
Go, go, go!

275
00:11:15,272 --> 00:11:16,272
OK.

276
00:11:16,272 --> 00:11:18,272
You're doing good. You're getting
closer.

277
00:11:18,272 --> 00:11:19,272
Thank you.

278
00:11:19,272 --> 00:11:26,778
Please subscribe to my channel!

279
00:11:26,778 --> 00:11:28,778
Close!

280
00:11:28,778 --> 00:11:30,778
Close!

281
00:11:30,778 --> 00:11:32,778
But the distance was perfect.

282
00:11:32,778 --> 00:11:34,778
I'm glad.

283
00:11:34,778 --> 00:11:36,778
The next one is a triple bogey.

284
00:11:36,778 --> 00:11:38,778
Yes.

285
00:11:38,778 --> 00:11:40,778
I just did it, so I'm getting used to
it.

286
00:11:40,778 --> 00:11:42,778
I see.

287
00:11:42,778 --> 00:11:44,778
I'm a birdie.

288
00:11:44,778 --> 00:11:46,778
Are you getting used to it?

289
00:11:46,778 --> 00:11:48,778
Yes, I am.

290
00:11:48,778 --> 00:11:50,778
How was your first simulation golf?

291
00:11:50,778 --> 00:11:54,778
It was a different kind of nervousness.

292
00:11:54,778 --> 00:11:56,778
Were you nervous?

293
00:11:56,778 --> 00:11:58,778
Yes, I was.

294
00:11:58,778 --> 00:12:04,778
But I felt I could do it with a relaxed
mind.

295
00:12:04,778 --> 00:12:06,778
You are so kind.

296
00:12:06,778 --> 00:12:11,778
I'm not, but I'm enjoying it.

297
00:12:11,778 --> 00:12:13,778
Thank you.

298
00:12:15,778 --> 00:12:19,778
I've brought something here.

299
00:12:19,778 --> 00:12:23,778
It's an approach competition.

300
00:12:23,778 --> 00:12:27,778
The one who gets the ball in the hole
first wins.

301
00:12:27,778 --> 00:12:33,778
I'll get in the big one.

302
00:12:33,778 --> 00:12:36,778
Nami will get in the small one.

303
00:12:36,778 --> 00:12:38,778
It's so different.

304
00:12:38,778 --> 00:12:41,778
It's not, but I'll do my best.

305
00:12:41,778 --> 00:12:45,778
I'll do my best.

306
00:12:45,778 --> 00:12:50,778
The loser will get a penalty game.

307
00:12:50,778 --> 00:12:52,778
What is it?

308
00:12:52,778 --> 00:12:56,778
I'll drink a very sour liquid.

309
00:12:56,778 --> 00:12:58,778
It's scary.

310
00:12:58,778 --> 00:13:00,778
Have you ever drunk it?

311
00:13:00,778 --> 00:13:06,778
Yes, but I felt like a dog.

312
00:13:06,778 --> 00:13:08,778
I was so thirsty.

313
00:13:08,778 --> 00:13:10,778
It's so sour.

314
00:13:10,778 --> 00:13:19,778
I heard it's more powerful than what
I've ever drunk.

315
00:13:19,778 --> 00:13:22,778
I don't need that power-up.

316
00:13:22,778 --> 00:13:25,778
I have to win.

317
00:13:25,778 --> 00:13:27,778
I'll do my best.

318
00:13:27,778 --> 00:13:31,778
Who will go first?

319
00:13:31,778 --> 00:13:33,778
Rock-paper-scissors?

320
00:13:33,778 --> 00:13:36,778
Rock-paper-scissors.

321
00:13:36,778 --> 00:13:39,778
Please choose.

322
00:13:39,778 --> 00:13:41,778
I'll go first.

323
00:13:41,778 --> 00:13:43,778
I'll go first.

324
00:13:43,778 --> 00:13:46,778
Higuchi, good luck.

325
00:13:46,778 --> 00:13:48,778
I'll go first.

326
00:13:51,992 --> 00:13:52,992
You're good!

327
00:13:52,992 --> 00:13:54,992
I'm surprised.

328
00:13:54,992 --> 00:13:56,992
You went to the left.

329
00:13:56,992 --> 00:13:58,992
It's hard to control the power.

330
00:13:58,992 --> 00:14:00,992
I don't need much power.

331
00:14:00,992 --> 00:14:02,992
It's hard to control the power.

332
00:14:02,992 --> 00:14:04,992
I'll go.

333
00:14:07,992 --> 00:14:09,992
Where did it go?

334
00:14:09,992 --> 00:14:11,992
Look.

335
00:14:13,992 --> 00:14:14,992
It's white.

336
00:14:14,992 --> 00:14:16,992
Is this white?

337
00:14:16,992 --> 00:14:18,992
It's white.

338
00:14:18,992 --> 00:14:20,848
I'll go.

339
00:14:20,848 --> 00:14:23,848
Where did it go? Where?

340
00:14:29,626 --> 00:14:31,626
You're not red!

341
00:14:31,626 --> 00:14:32,626
Safe!

342
00:14:32,626 --> 00:14:33,626
Lucky!

343
00:14:33,626 --> 00:14:34,626
You're lucky!

344
00:14:34,626 --> 00:14:36,626
But it's amazing!

345
00:14:36,626 --> 00:14:37,626
That was perfect!

346
00:14:37,626 --> 00:14:39,626
A miracle happened!

347
00:14:39,626 --> 00:14:40,626
Amazing!

348
00:14:40,626 --> 00:14:41,626
Just like that!

349
00:14:44,626 --> 00:14:46,626
Wait! You're so good!

350
00:14:46,626 --> 00:14:47,626
She's good at it!

351
00:14:47,626 --> 00:14:48,626
She's good at it!

352
00:14:49,626 --> 00:14:51,626
Wait! You're so good!

353
00:14:51,626 --> 00:14:53,626
You're too strong!

354
00:14:55,448 --> 00:14:56,448
You did really well!

355
00:14:56,448 --> 00:14:59,448
I should have held my power a little
longer.

356
00:14:59,448 --> 00:15:00,448
You did well!

357
00:15:00,448 --> 00:15:02,448
You're too good!

358
00:15:07,448 --> 00:15:09,448
So close!

359
00:15:10,448 --> 00:15:12,448
This distance is just right.

360
00:15:12,448 --> 00:15:13,448
It's difficult.

361
00:15:13,448 --> 00:15:14,448
The distance is just right.

362
00:15:14,448 --> 00:15:16,352
The distance is just right.

363
00:15:17,352 --> 00:15:18,352
I was close.

364
00:15:20,352 --> 00:15:22,352
Will this game end today?

365
00:15:22,352 --> 00:15:24,352
It will be a long battle.

366
00:15:24,352 --> 00:15:26,352
The distance is just right.

367
00:15:28,352 --> 00:15:30,352
You are strong.

368
00:15:32,352 --> 00:15:33,352
You are strong.

369
00:15:33,352 --> 00:15:35,352
You are already winning.

370
00:15:37,352 --> 00:15:39,352
The distance is just right.

371
00:15:40,352 --> 00:15:41,352
You are good.

372
00:15:41,352 --> 00:15:43,312
Nice. But I was able to win.

373
00:15:44,312 --> 00:15:46,312
It's difficult.

374
00:15:47,312 --> 00:15:49,312
If the target was bigger, I would have
won.

375
00:15:50,312 --> 00:15:51,312
You are complaining to the target.

376
00:15:52,312 --> 00:15:53,312
It's difficult.

377
00:15:54,312 --> 00:15:55,312
I'm strong.

378
00:15:55,312 --> 00:16:01,210
Please subscribe to my channel.

379
00:16:01,210 --> 00:16:02,210
It's big!

380
00:16:02,210 --> 00:16:03,710
But it's amazing!

381
00:16:03,710 --> 00:16:06,210
But you can roll it in like this, right?

382
00:16:06,210 --> 00:16:07,210
I see.

383
00:16:07,210 --> 00:16:09,210
Hina, you can do that too.

384
00:16:09,210 --> 00:16:10,210
I have that strategy.

385
00:16:10,210 --> 00:16:11,210
You're kind.

386
00:16:11,210 --> 00:16:13,210
You're teaching your opponent.

387
00:16:14,210 --> 00:16:16,210
Hina's strategy

388
00:16:18,210 --> 00:16:19,210
It's going in!

389
00:16:19,210 --> 00:16:20,210
It's big!

390
00:16:21,368 --> 00:16:22,368
Nice!

391
00:16:22,368 --> 00:16:25,368
But it's a little tilted.

392
00:16:25,368 --> 00:16:28,368
It's because of the train in front of
us.

393
00:16:28,368 --> 00:16:31,368
It's not straight.

394
00:16:31,368 --> 00:16:33,368
It's difficult even if it's a little
curvy.

395
00:16:33,368 --> 00:16:34,368
Let's go.

396
00:16:39,368 --> 00:16:41,368
It's white again!

397
00:16:41,368 --> 00:16:43,368
It's not going in.

398
00:16:43,368 --> 00:16:45,368
Red is difficult.

399
00:16:45,368 --> 00:16:46,368
It's difficult.

400
00:16:46,368 --> 00:16:48,368
Go!

401
00:16:49,540 --> 00:16:51,540
Ah, that way.

402
00:16:51,540 --> 00:16:54,440
Acrobatic provinces are difficult!

403
00:16:54,600 --> 00:16:57,100
But I was more into it!

404
00:16:57,100 --> 00:16:59,020
Yeah, if we were more focused...

405
00:16:59,020 --> 00:17:00,980
And with that...

406
00:17:00,840 --> 00:17:03,440
The Lesson premieres on August 26th!!

407
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:04,440
Come on!

408
00:17:04,474 --> 00:17:08,474
I'm going to lose all the balls here
today.

409
00:17:08,474 --> 00:17:10,474
It's harder than I thought.

410
00:17:10,474 --> 00:17:12,474
The last try!

411
00:17:14,474 --> 00:17:16,474
I got it!

412
00:17:16,474 --> 00:17:18,474
She got it!

413
00:17:18,474 --> 00:17:20,474
I got it!

414
00:17:22,474 --> 00:17:24,474
I got it!

415
00:17:24,474 --> 00:17:26,474
I got it!

416
00:17:26,474 --> 00:17:28,474
You're good!

417
00:17:28,474 --> 00:17:29,474
Nice!

418
00:17:29,474 --> 00:17:30,586
Thank you!

419
00:17:30,586 --> 00:17:31,586
Wow!

420
00:17:31,586 --> 00:17:33,586
It's the biggest one.

421
00:17:33,586 --> 00:17:35,586
But it went in so cleanly.

422
00:17:36,586 --> 00:17:40,586
If I can put this in, I win.

423
00:17:40,586 --> 00:17:42,586
But if you can't, you lose.

424
00:17:42,586 --> 00:17:44,586
The penalty game is...

425
00:17:45,586 --> 00:17:47,586
Let's do our best. I'm so nervous.

426
00:17:48,586 --> 00:17:50,586
Please, God, come in.

427
00:17:54,586 --> 00:17:55,586
No!

428
00:17:55,586 --> 00:17:57,264
To be continued

429
00:17:57,264 --> 00:17:59,264
I won! Is this okay?

430
00:17:59,264 --> 00:18:00,264
It's okay.

431
00:18:00,264 --> 00:18:02,264
I'm sorry. I got a lot of hits.

432
00:18:02,264 --> 00:18:03,264
No, no, no, no, no.

433
00:18:03,264 --> 00:18:04,264
I did it!

434
00:18:04,264 --> 00:18:05,264
Nice!

435
00:18:05,264 --> 00:18:07,264
You were really good.

436
00:18:07,264 --> 00:18:08,264
Thank you.

437
00:18:08,264 --> 00:18:10,264
It's difficult, isn't it?

438
00:18:10,264 --> 00:18:12,264
Strength and slope.

439
00:18:12,264 --> 00:18:16,264
But there weren't many people who could
get the ball up like this from the
beginning.

440
00:18:16,264 --> 00:18:17,264
Is that so?

441
00:18:17,264 --> 00:18:19,264
I was really surprised.

442
00:18:19,264 --> 00:18:20,264
But you're really good.

443
00:18:20,264 --> 00:18:21,264
The penalty game.

444
00:18:21,264 --> 00:18:23,264
That's right. The penalty game.

445
00:18:23,264 --> 00:18:24,264
Please.

446
00:18:24,264 --> 00:18:25,264
Yes.

447
00:18:25,264 --> 00:18:26,264
I'll have a drink.

448
00:18:26,264 --> 00:18:27,264
Is there a penalty game?

449
00:18:27,264 --> 00:18:29,264
I think there is. I'm preparing for it.

450
00:18:29,264 --> 00:18:30,264
Is there a penalty game?

451
00:18:30,264 --> 00:18:31,264
Let's do it!

452
00:18:33,288 --> 00:18:34,288
What's the penalty?

453
00:18:34,288 --> 00:18:38,288
The penalty game is to drink a special
drink.

454
00:18:38,288 --> 00:18:41,288
I'll have a special drink.

455
00:18:41,288 --> 00:18:42,288
Look at this.

456
00:18:42,288 --> 00:18:43,288
Sorry.

457
00:18:44,288 --> 00:18:46,288
It's a drink that comes in a bottle.

458
00:18:47,288 --> 00:18:48,288
It looks like water.

459
00:18:48,288 --> 00:18:50,288
How does it smell?

460
00:18:50,288 --> 00:18:51,288
It smells like...

461
00:18:53,288 --> 00:18:54,288
Ramune.

462
00:18:55,288 --> 00:18:56,288
I think I can drink it.

463
00:18:56,288 --> 00:18:57,288
I'll try it.

464
00:18:57,288 --> 00:18:58,288
I'll try it.

465
00:19:02,714 --> 00:19:04,714
The color of my eyes changed.

466
00:19:04,714 --> 00:19:06,714
Oh, my God!

467
00:19:06,714 --> 00:19:08,714
Oh, my God!

468
00:19:08,714 --> 00:19:10,714
I'm glad you have eyelashes.

469
00:19:10,714 --> 00:19:12,714
I want some water.

470
00:19:12,714 --> 00:19:14,714
I won't give you water.

471
00:19:14,714 --> 00:19:17,760
There are about 100 pickled plums.

472
00:19:18,760 --> 00:19:19,760
I'm getting used to it.

473
00:19:19,760 --> 00:19:21,760
I can tell you're going to be a dog.

474
00:19:22,760 --> 00:19:24,760
I'm a dog today.

475
00:19:26,760 --> 00:19:32,760
We played a simulation golf with Namiki.

476
00:19:32,760 --> 00:19:33,760
It was really fun.

477
00:19:33,760 --> 00:19:35,760
Thank you.

478
00:19:36,760 --> 00:19:41,760
I think it's more fun to practice with a
few people than to practice alone.

479
00:19:42,760 --> 00:19:44,760
Let's practice together in the future.

480
00:19:44,760 --> 00:19:46,760
Thank you for teaching me a lot.

481
00:19:47,760 --> 00:19:49,760
I'm not a professional, so I'm not good
at it.

482
00:19:51,760 --> 00:19:57,760
I'm doing a golf competition on Namiki's
YouTube channel.
