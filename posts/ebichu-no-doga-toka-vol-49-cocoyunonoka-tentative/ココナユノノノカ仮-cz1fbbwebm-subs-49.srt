1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Ebi-Chu's video!

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Ebi-Chu's video

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:10,000
It's morning time. We are Shiritu Ebi
Chugaku.

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:13,000
I'm Sakura Yukokona, number 13.

5
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:16,000
I'm Yuno Kokubo, number 14.

6
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:19,000
I'm Kazami Nanoka, number 15.

7
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:22,000
What do you do when you're done?

8
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:25,000
When I'm done, I can finally go home.

9
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,000
I'm done.

10
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:31,000
I don't know if I'll be able to go home
from here.

11
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:34,000
I don't know if I'll be able to go home
from here.

12
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:35,000
That's right.

13
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:37,000
It's Nagoya.

14
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:42,000
I thought about it and thought I didn't
want to go home.

15
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:45,000
What do you do when you're done?

16
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:48,000
I'm on the phone when I'm eating
dumplings.

17
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
Not on the phone, but in the mail.

18
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:54,000
I'm a dumpling lover.

19
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
I'll make dumplings for you next time.

20
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
I'm going.

21
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:02,000
What do you think of the girls you've
seen in the audition?

22
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
I was very nervous.

23
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
I thought there were a lot of cute
girls.

24
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:10,000
I saw a lot of cute girls in the
audition video.

25
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:13,000
I thought there were a lot of cute
girls.

26
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:16,000
I thought I could get along with them.

27
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:20,000
I thought they were all enemies.

28
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:23,000
I thought they were more close.

29
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:26,000
I got used to it.

30
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:29,000
What was the most difficult thing you've
ever done?

31
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:33,000
The next day...

32
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:36,000
The next day was a lot of muscle pain.

33
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
I was so tired.

34
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
I was so sleepy.

35
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:41,000
I see.

36
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,000
What did you do?

37
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:45,000
What did I do?

38
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:49,000
I was sleeping until 10 o'clock.

39
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:53,000
I was studying and rolling around.

40
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,000
You have to study hard.

41
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,000
I have to study hard.

42
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,000
I can't catch up.

43
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
I'm studying because I'm resting.

44
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:03,000
You're the youngest, right?

45
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,000
That's right.

46
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,000
What was the most difficult thing you've
ever done?

47
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,000
I've been waiting.

48
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:14,000
I've been watching the seniors' stages
for a long time.

49
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:17,000
I was very nervous.

50
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:21,000
I was nervous and excited.

51
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,000
I was busy.

52
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,000
What was the most difficult thing you've
ever done?

53
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:28,000
I've been dancing all the time.

54
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:32,000
I didn't say ha-ha when I was talking.

55
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
I thought it was amazing.

56
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,834
Thank you for your viewing.

57
00:02:35,834 --> 00:02:41,594
When Kobayashi or Ho-chan asked me what
to call, I said,

58
00:02:41,594 --> 00:02:43,194
I said, call me Bo.

59
00:02:43,194 --> 00:02:45,754
When I was called Bo-chan, I was sad.

60
00:02:45,754 --> 00:02:46,794
Really?

61
00:02:46,794 --> 00:02:48,394
I was called Bo-chan.

62
00:02:48,394 --> 00:02:51,354
I was sad when I was called Chan.

63
00:02:51,354 --> 00:02:54,554
So I was called Bo.

64
00:02:54,554 --> 00:02:56,154
But I don't have that courage.

65
00:02:56,154 --> 00:02:57,354
It's Ho-chan.

66
00:02:57,354 --> 00:02:58,794
Ho-chan.

67
00:02:58,794 --> 00:03:02,394
I called Ho-chan for the first time
today.

68
00:03:02,394 --> 00:03:06,394
How did you feel when you were on stage?

69
00:03:06,394 --> 00:03:10,394
It was a moment.

70
00:03:10,394 --> 00:03:12,394
When I was on stage.

71
00:03:12,394 --> 00:03:14,394
I was shy.

72
00:03:14,394 --> 00:03:16,394
I was a genius.

73
00:03:16,394 --> 00:03:18,394
I was standing on the stage.

74
00:03:18,394 --> 00:03:20,394
I was on the stairs.

75
00:03:20,394 --> 00:03:22,394
I was saying hello.

76
00:03:22,394 --> 00:03:26,394
It was a moment.

77
00:03:26,394 --> 00:03:36,394
I think it was longer than that stage
when I was talking to the members.

78
00:03:36,394 --> 00:03:40,394
What kind of performance do you want to
do?

79
00:03:40,394 --> 00:03:42,394
I want to do a dance.

80
00:03:42,394 --> 00:03:48,394
I want to stand here and float around
the audience.

81
00:03:48,394 --> 00:03:50,394
I want to do it.

82
00:03:50,394 --> 00:03:52,394
I want to do it.

83
00:03:52,394 --> 00:03:56,394
I want to do a dance with a flame coming
out of the bottom.

84
00:03:56,394 --> 00:03:58,394
I want to do that.

85
00:03:58,394 --> 00:04:00,394
I want to do a dance with water coming
out of the bottom.

86
00:04:00,394 --> 00:04:02,394
I want to do that.

87
00:04:02,394 --> 00:04:06,394
I want to do a pop-up dance with more
momentum.

88
00:04:06,394 --> 00:04:08,394
I want to do that.

89
00:04:08,394 --> 00:04:12,394
I think that's more scary.

90
00:04:12,394 --> 00:04:18,394
We introduce the octopus of the shrimp-
shaped rocket.

91
00:04:18,394 --> 00:04:22,394
What is your favorite food?

92
00:04:22,394 --> 00:04:24,394
What is your favorite food?

93
00:04:24,394 --> 00:04:28,394
Raw oysters, meat, and Korean food.

00:04:28,394 --> 00:04:30,394
What is your favorite Korean food?

95
00:04:30,394 --> 00:04:36,394
Korean food is ramen, shiitake
mushrooms, and tteokbokki.

96
00:04:36,394 --> 00:04:38,394
What is your favorite food?

97
00:04:38,394 --> 00:04:42,394
Eggplant, shiitake mushrooms, and green
onions.

98
00:04:42,394 --> 00:04:44,394
The same.

99
00:04:44,394 --> 00:04:46,394
Where do you want to go?

100
00:04:46,394 --> 00:04:48,394
Now?

101
00:04:48,394 --> 00:04:52,394
I want to go to Korea and Disney.

102
00:04:52,394 --> 00:04:54,394
Let's go.

103
00:04:54,394 --> 00:04:56,394
I'm going.

104
00:04:56,394 --> 00:04:58,394
What is your birthday?

105
00:04:58,394 --> 00:05:00,394
September 14th.

106
00:05:00,394 --> 00:05:04,394
What kind of food would you like to
receive?

107
00:05:04,394 --> 00:05:07,170
I want to receive anything.

108
00:05:07,170 --> 00:05:11,170
Yuna and I will choose the birthday
presents from here.

109
00:05:12,170 --> 00:05:14,170
Oh, the presents you will buy.

110
00:05:17,170 --> 00:05:19,170
Cosmetics?

111
00:05:19,170 --> 00:05:22,170
Do you write your favorite idol group?

112
00:05:24,170 --> 00:05:34,170
TWICE, BLACKPINK, and MAMAMOO.

113
00:05:34,170 --> 00:05:37,170
Do you know them?

114
00:05:37,170 --> 00:05:39,170
Yes, I know them.

115
00:05:40,170 --> 00:05:43,170
What's your favorite song?

116
00:05:43,170 --> 00:05:49,170
Well, I like I'll be here by RENTA of I.

117
00:05:49,170 --> 00:05:51,170
What's your favorite subject?

118
00:05:51,170 --> 00:05:55,170
English and Japanese.

119
00:05:55,170 --> 00:05:57,170
Is it a grammar?

120
00:05:57,170 --> 00:05:59,170
I don't like it.

121
00:05:59,170 --> 00:06:05,170
I don't like math.

122
00:06:07,170 --> 00:06:09,170
What's your favorite color?

123
00:06:09,170 --> 00:06:11,170
Pink or red.

124
00:06:12,170 --> 00:06:16,170
Why do you write vegetables in your
heart?

125
00:06:16,170 --> 00:06:19,170
It's not a leaf, it's a leaf.

126
00:06:24,170 --> 00:06:26,170
Why do you write like this?

127
00:06:26,170 --> 00:06:34,170
I want my mom to be a nice person like a
flower.

128
00:06:34,170 --> 00:06:36,170
A nice person?

129
00:06:36,170 --> 00:06:38,170
Vegetables.

130
00:06:38,170 --> 00:06:40,170
That's terrible.

131
00:06:40,170 --> 00:06:43,170
No, it's a good idea.

132
00:06:43,170 --> 00:06:45,170
How many siblings do you have?

133
00:06:45,170 --> 00:06:48,170
I have an older sister.

134
00:06:48,170 --> 00:06:50,170
I'm 18 years old.

135
00:06:50,170 --> 00:06:54,170
I've been working hard on my sister's
clothes.

136
00:06:54,170 --> 00:07:02,170
I often give her makeup tools and
dresses.

137
00:07:02,170 --> 00:07:04,170
Are you kind?

138
00:07:04,170 --> 00:07:06,170
Yes.

139
00:07:06,170 --> 00:07:09,170
I don't think so.

140
00:07:09,170 --> 00:07:11,170
Then you're kind.

141
00:07:11,170 --> 00:07:13,170
Yes.

142
00:07:13,170 --> 00:07:25,170
This is my hair style.

143
00:07:27,170 --> 00:07:30,170
When did you get that hairstyle?

144
00:07:30,170 --> 00:07:32,170
When did I get it?

145
00:07:32,170 --> 00:07:37,218
I got it when I was in the first grade
of junior high school.

146
00:07:37,218 --> 00:07:40,218
I wanted to make it short.

147
00:07:40,218 --> 00:07:41,718
So I made it short.

148
00:07:41,718 --> 00:07:43,718
It was long until then.

149
00:07:43,718 --> 00:07:46,718
My birthday is March 20th.

150
00:07:46,718 --> 00:07:48,718
Where do you buy clothes?

151
00:07:48,718 --> 00:07:51,218
I buy clothes from the internet.

152
00:07:51,218 --> 00:07:53,718
I buy clothes from the internet.

153
00:07:53,718 --> 00:07:55,218
What is your favorite fruit?

154
00:07:55,218 --> 00:07:58,218
My favorite fruit is dragon fruit.

155
00:07:58,218 --> 00:07:59,218
I like cherry blossoms.

156
00:07:59,218 --> 00:08:03,218
What is your favorite movie?

157
00:08:03,218 --> 00:08:08,218
I don't watch movies that I often watch.

158
00:08:08,218 --> 00:08:14,218
I haven't been impressed, but I like
movies that are very pleasant.

159
00:08:14,218 --> 00:08:17,218
I used to watch movies that are very
pleasant.

160
00:08:17,218 --> 00:08:20,218
I like movies that are very pleasant.

161
00:08:20,218 --> 00:08:21,218

I like basketball, but now I like the
national team.

165
00:08:31,218 --> 00:08:36,218
I will never lose to anyone.

166
00:08:36,218 --> 00:08:39,218
What is your ability to find cute girls?

167
00:08:39,218 --> 00:08:43,218
I'm good at finding cute girls.

168
00:08:43,218 --> 00:08:45,218
What is your specialty?

169
00:08:45,218 --> 00:08:48,218
I don't have a specialty.

170
00:08:48,218 --> 00:08:51,218
I wrote that I was a bamboo horse.

171
00:08:51,218 --> 00:08:56,218
I haven't done it since I graduated from
elementary school, so I don't think I
can do it.

172
00:08:56,218 --> 00:09:02,218
What is your brother's specialty?

173
00:09:02,218 --> 00:09:05,218
I have a brother.

00:09:13,218 --> 00:09:15,218
How tall are you?

178
00:09:15,218 --> 00:09:18,218
I'm 156.8 cm.

179
00:09:18,218 --> 00:09:29,218
What is your favorite song?

180
00:09:29,218 --> 00:09:31,218

00:09:31,218 --> 00:09:34,218
I like yellow and pink.

182
00:09:34,218 --> 00:09:36,218
What did you learn?

242
00:11:51,518 --> 00:11:52,518
It is scattered.

243
00:11:52,518 --> 00:11:53,518
Right.

244
00:11:53,518 --> 00:11:55,518
It is scattered.

245
00:11:57,518 --> 00:11:59,518
What are three special objects in your
mind?

246
00:11:59,518 --> 00:12:01,518
Tokyo Aichi Baleki.

247
00:12:01,518 --> 00:12:02,318
To...

248
00:12:02,318 --> 00:12:03,518
To go to Toy.

249
00:12:03,518 --> 00:12:08,518
I think it's a different kind of love.

250
00:12:09,518 --> 00:12:11,518
Toai.

251
00:12:13,518 --> 00:12:15,518
Toaibaraki.

252
00:12:16,518 --> 00:12:19,518
Toaibaraki is a different kind of love.

253
00:12:20,518 --> 00:12:22,518
Toaibaraki is the love of Aichi.

254
00:12:23,518 --> 00:12:25,518
Toaiba.

255
00:12:27,518 --> 00:12:29,518
Toaiba.

256
00:12:29,518 --> 00:12:31,518

I don't know.

258
00:12:34,518 --> 00:12:36,518
Is it a name of a place?

Kono-chan, please say it until the end.

260
00:12:39,518 --> 00:12:42,786
Is it a place?

261
00:12:42,786 --> 00:12:50,786
I think it's a good idea to make it a
kanji.

262
00:12:50,786 --> 00:12:55,786
It's a very difficult kanji.

263
00:12:55,786 --> 00:12:59,786
For example, the word hardens.

264
00:12:59,786 --> 00:13:01,786
It's hard.

265
00:13:01,786 --> 00:13:03,786

00:13:03,786 --> 00:13:07,786
What should I do?

267
00:13:07,786 --> 00:13:13,786
I think it's good to use katakana.

268
00:13:13,786 --> 00:13:16,786
I think it's good.

269
00:13:16,786 --> 00:13:19,786
It's easier to say.

270
00:13:19,786 --> 00:13:22,786
It's hard to decide.

271
00:13:22,786 --> 00:13:26,786
I will ask you to use it.

272
00:13:26,786 --> 00:13:29,786
Please use the hashtag.

273
00:13:29,786 --> 00:13:33,786
Please use the name of the shrimp-
centered member.

274
00:13:33,786 --> 00:13:36,786

275
00:13:36,786 --> 00:13:38,786
