1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,080
I was so depressed that I thought I had
no choice but to face the night.

2
00:00:05,080 --> 00:00:20,954
I was so anxious that I thought I would
end up in the night.

3
00:00:20,954 --> 00:00:23,954
It's getting more and more fun.

4
00:00:23,954 --> 00:00:26,954
Yes, I'm having a lot of fun.

5
00:00:26,954 --> 00:00:29,954
Please talk more.

6
00:00:29,954 --> 00:00:32,954
I might end up listening to you.

7
00:00:32,954 --> 00:00:34,954
Please do.

8
00:00:34,954 --> 00:00:36,954
I'll talk to you.

9
00:00:36,954 --> 00:00:55,954
Please.

10
00:00:56,378 --> 00:01:04,378
I was simply told that if I sing, my
family will praise me.

11
00:01:04,378 --> 00:01:09,378
That's how I started singing.

12
00:01:09,378 --> 00:01:16,378
I was living in a complex when I was
little.

13
00:01:16,378 --> 00:01:21,378
My brother was smart and good at sports.

14
00:01:21,378 --> 00:01:26,304
It seemed a little bright to me.

15
00:01:26,304 --> 00:01:30,704
I felt like my family was really
accepting of me.

16
00:01:30,704 --> 00:01:37,704
I wanted to be recognized by them.

17
00:01:37,704 --> 00:01:43,704
If I sing, my family will pay attention
to me.

18
00:01:43,704 --> 00:01:47,704
That's how I started to continue.

19
00:01:47,704 --> 00:01:51,504
What kind of songs did you sing at that
time?

20
00:01:51,504 --> 00:01:55,296
I sang the songs that were popular at
that time.

21
00:01:55,296 --> 00:02:05,296
I sang songs that were popular at that
time.

22
00:02:05,296 --> 00:02:08,296
You were praised a lot.

23
00:02:08,296 --> 00:02:11,296
Yes, I was praised a lot.

24
00:02:11,296 --> 00:02:15,296
That's why I became a singer.

25
00:02:15,296 --> 00:02:21,296
When I was young, I wanted to be a
singer.

26
00:02:21,296 --> 00:02:23,184
I was praised a lot.

27
00:02:23,184 --> 00:02:26,464
People said I wasn't special.

28
00:02:26,464 --> 00:02:30,784
There were many turning points.

29
00:02:30,784 --> 00:02:34,544
But my first experience was

30
00:02:34,544 --> 00:02:40,824
that I was recognized for my singing.

31
00:02:40,824 --> 00:02:44,704
Do you have a way of communicating?

32
00:02:44,704 --> 00:02:46,224
Yes, I do.

33
00:02:46,224 --> 00:02:53,104
I thought singing was more meaningful
than music.

34
00:02:53,104 --> 00:02:53,232
Can you show me something?

35
00:02:53,232 --> 00:02:59,232
I thought singing was the same as
expressing yourself.

36
00:02:59,232 --> 00:03:03,232
I was able to get attention by
communicating with people by singing.

37
00:03:03,232 --> 00:03:09,232
I learned that singing is fun, so I
realized that I can't do it just by
having fun.

38
00:03:09,232 --> 00:03:13,232
That's right. That was a little early.

39
00:03:13,232 --> 00:03:19,232
But you must have put a lot of effort
into it.

40
00:03:19,232 --> 00:03:22,704
I think there was a little bit of a
hesitation.

41
00:03:22,704 --> 00:03:27,704
You were recording in your own room?

42
00:03:27,704 --> 00:03:28,704
Yes, yes.

43
00:03:28,704 --> 00:03:29,704
You were using Oda City?

44
00:03:29,704 --> 00:03:32,704
Yes, I was using Oda City.

45
00:03:32,704 --> 00:03:36,704
I was using free software called Oda
City,

46
00:03:36,704 --> 00:03:39,704
and a USB microphone.

47
00:03:39,704 --> 00:03:43,704
I didn't even use an interface.

48
00:03:43,704 --> 00:03:48,768
I was trying to do it when my family
wasn't around.

49
00:03:48,768 --> 00:03:50,768
I was recording.

50
00:03:50,768 --> 00:03:52,768
So you were told that you would be fired
if you were in the band?

51
00:03:52,768 --> 00:03:54,768
Yes.

52
00:03:54,768 --> 00:03:56,768
I was told that I would be fired.

53
00:03:56,768 --> 00:03:58,768
Oh, really?

54
00:03:58,768 --> 00:04:02,768
Yes. I was told that I would be a civil
servant.

55
00:04:02,768 --> 00:04:04,768
I said that I would not sing anymore.

56
00:04:04,768 --> 00:04:10,768
I would go to college and become a civil
servant.

57
00:04:10,768 --> 00:04:12,288
I was told that I would be a civil
servant.

58
00:04:12,288 --> 00:04:14,288
So you had to hide and check yourself.

59
00:04:14,288 --> 00:04:16,288
That's right.

60
00:04:16,288 --> 00:04:18,288
That's why I became like this.

61
00:04:18,288 --> 00:04:21,288
When I sing as myself,

62
00:04:21,288 --> 00:04:24,288
I'm scared.

63
00:04:24,288 --> 00:04:26,288
I wanted to sing as myself,

64
00:04:26,288 --> 00:04:30,288
who is not a singer.

65
00:04:30,288 --> 00:04:42,288
I wanted to sing without anyone knowing.

66
00:04:42,362 --> 00:04:46,362
I'm sorry, but I'm not going to do it.

67
00:04:46,362 --> 00:04:50,362
I'm really sorry, but I'm not going to
do it.

68
00:04:50,362 --> 00:04:52,362
Normally, it's a plan.

69
00:04:52,362 --> 00:04:55,362
It's a plan to give it to me.

70
00:04:55,362 --> 00:04:56,362
That's right.

71
00:04:56,362 --> 00:05:00,362
But I thought it would be better to say
no.

72
00:05:00,362 --> 00:05:03,792
So I decided not to do it this time.

73
00:05:03,792 --> 00:05:07,292
When you listen to the story,

74
00:05:07,292 --> 00:05:09,792
you really admire someone who sings.

75
00:05:09,792 --> 00:05:13,792
It's completely different from the way
you sing to become that person.

76
00:05:13,792 --> 00:05:15,292
It's different.

77
00:05:15,292 --> 00:05:20,292
I think there are many people who admire
being a musician.

78
00:05:20,292 --> 00:05:22,792
They want to be like this person,

79
00:05:22,792 --> 00:05:24,792
they want to be like this person,

80
00:05:24,792 --> 00:05:26,292
they want to make music.

81
00:05:26,292 --> 00:05:28,792
I think they've experienced that.

82
00:05:28,792 --> 00:05:29,792
That's right.

83
00:05:29,792 --> 00:05:31,872
That's how I see it.

84
00:05:31,872 --> 00:05:36,872
I think the sense of music is different.

85
00:05:36,872 --> 00:05:41,872
As I said earlier, I thought it was one
way to express it.

86
00:05:41,872 --> 00:05:45,872
I've been singing as a means.

87
00:05:45,872 --> 00:05:50,872
What's important is to express yourself.

88
00:05:50,872 --> 00:05:59,872
If I refer to someone else, I can't
express my personality.

89
00:05:59,872 --> 00:06:01,872
That's why I'm able to do it.

90
00:06:01,920 --> 00:06:08,920
I don't listen to specific people, and I
don't refer to them.

91
00:06:09,080 --> 00:06:16,160
That's why I'm able to cover vocalists.

92
00:06:16,320 --> 00:06:21,160
I can't do it for a person who's not a
vocalist.

93
00:06:21,160 --> 00:06:27,168
I want to add something more human.

94
00:06:27,168 --> 00:06:32,168
I enjoyed being able to express it on
this side.

95
00:06:33,168 --> 00:06:38,168
You were able to cover Vocaloid songs.

96
00:06:38,168 --> 00:06:40,168
Is there anything difficult about it?

97
00:06:40,168 --> 00:06:53,068
Is it a kind of

98
00:06:43,168 --> 00:06:45,168
It's difficult.

99
00:06:45,168 --> 00:06:47,168
In the first place, humans don't sing.

100
00:06:47,168 --> 00:06:48,168
That's right.

101
00:06:48,168 --> 00:06:53,168
There are also lines that are impossible
for humans.

102
00:06:53,168 --> 00:06:56,256
But that's interesting.

103
00:06:56,256 --> 00:07:01,256
When it's difficult, I feel like I want
to challenge myself more.

104
00:07:01,756 --> 00:07:09,256
So, every time I finished recording, I
was able to get something.

105
00:07:09,756 --> 00:07:13,256
I was able to learn new expressions,
like,

106
00:07:13,756 --> 00:07:20,756
I'm a little better at this.

107
00:07:20,756 --> 00:07:25,756
I was able to grow and it was fun, so I
kept trying.

108
00:07:26,304 --> 00:07:34,304
I think I can show my character in
various ways depending on the song.

109
00:07:34,304 --> 00:07:44,304
In the song, I showed my character in
three different ways,

110
00:07:44,304 --> 00:07:49,304
but I was impressed that Yama-san was
able to express it well.

111
00:07:49,304 --> 00:07:55,296
I was able to release the song while
thinking about that.

112
00:07:55,296 --> 00:07:58,096
When Haruo Tsugeru hit the music scene,

113
00:07:58,096 --> 00:08:02,256
a famous artist called Yorukei was
popular.

114
00:08:02,256 --> 00:08:07,936
There were many artists who were the
theme of Yorukei.

115
00:08:07,936 --> 00:08:13,776
I was able to get involved in that
genre.

116
00:08:13,776 --> 00:08:17,096
I can sing rock like Mahi,

117
00:08:17,096 --> 00:08:19,680
I can sing ballads, anything.

118
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:25,680
I wanted people to know that I can sing.

119
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:35,680
So I'm trying to make music that doesn't
have a genre.

120
00:08:35,680 --> 00:08:41,680
I'm glad I got the chance to do it.

121
00:08:41,680 --> 00:08:49,466
Thank you.

122
00:08:49,466 --> 00:08:53,466
So you want to put on a new mask today?

123
00:08:53,466 --> 00:08:57,466
Yes, I'm going to be doing a renewal
this year.

124
00:08:57,466 --> 00:09:03,466
I don't know if you'll be able to see it
well, but my vision has improved.

125
00:09:03,466 --> 00:09:05,466
That's important.

126
00:09:05,466 --> 00:09:09,466
It was hard to see, so I was able to
blink.

127
00:09:09,466 --> 00:09:11,466
You couldn't blink before?

128
00:09:11,466 --> 00:09:14,466
I couldn't.

129
00:09:14,466 --> 00:09:14,736
Thank you for watching.

130
00:09:14,736 --> 00:09:17,736
My eyes were open.

131
00:09:17,736 --> 00:09:19,736
Your eyelashes were open.

132
00:09:19,736 --> 00:09:20,736
Yes, they were.

133
00:09:20,736 --> 00:09:21,736
That's tough.

134
00:09:21,736 --> 00:09:25,736
Do you order the mask to match the shape
of your face?

135
00:09:25,736 --> 00:09:26,736
Yes, I do.

136
00:09:26,736 --> 00:09:30,736
I take the mold off with a plaster.

137
00:09:30,736 --> 00:09:33,736
If you make it too perfect, you can't
make it perfect.

138
00:09:33,736 --> 00:09:35,736
Yes, that's right.

139
00:09:35,736 --> 00:09:38,736
I think many people have asked this
question.

140
00:09:38,736 --> 00:09:41,736
Why are you wearing a mask?

141
00:09:41,736 --> 00:09:44,304
I'm not sure.

142
00:09:44,304 --> 00:09:48,544
When I'm showing my own characteristics,

143
00:09:48,544 --> 00:09:51,644
I think I'll be a little biased and
listen to the music.

144
00:09:51,644 --> 00:09:57,064
I don't think it's a good idea to do
that.

145
00:09:57,064 --> 00:10:05,264
So I want you to enjoy your music as
clean as possible.

146
00:10:05,264 --> 00:10:07,304
I want you to enjoy your music as clean
as possible.

147
00:10:07,304 --> 00:10:12,240
That's why I'm doing this kind of
activity now.

148
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:17,240
When did you decide to wear a mask?

149
00:10:17,240 --> 00:10:26,240
To be honest, I didn't want to do a live
performance at all.

150
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:34,240
But Haruo Tsukeru hit me and asked me to
do a live performance.

151
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:39,648
I kept refusing to do it.

152
00:10:39,648 --> 00:10:48,648
I thought I would definitely get a good
vibe when I performed live.

153
00:10:48,648 --> 00:10:52,328
I was really resisting. I didn't want to
show any mercy.

154
00:10:52,328 --> 00:10:56,328
I really wanted to hear only the song.

155
00:10:56,328 --> 00:11:02,848
But it's okay to do a live broadcast, so
I thought I'd try it once.

156
00:11:02,848 --> 00:11:09,728
So, how do you show yourself on the
screen?

157
00:11:09,840 --> 00:11:19,840
I was thinking of putting on a mask
while we were having a meeting.

158
00:11:20,840 --> 00:11:22,840
Did you have any particular thoughts
about the mask?

159
00:11:23,840 --> 00:11:25,840
I was originally going for a full face.

160
00:11:28,840 --> 00:11:30,840
You look like Daft Punk.

161
00:11:30,840 --> 00:11:38,840
I was hoping for a full face like Daft
Punk.

162
00:11:39,168 --> 00:11:43,168
It's like when you come to know the
vocals,

163
00:11:43,368 --> 00:11:47,408
your singing doesn't help get in your
voice.

164
00:11:47,568 --> 00:11:50,548
That's what I decided.

165
00:11:50,708 --> 00:11:56,688
So, the designer asked me to develop my
accent without asking me too much.

166
00:11:57,648 --> 00:11:59,528
LGR

167
00:11:59,642 --> 00:12:03,642
I've never had the experience of
enjoying music alone.

168
00:12:03,642 --> 00:12:07,642
I didn't know what it was like to enjoy
music.

169
00:12:07,642 --> 00:12:13,642
At first, I felt like I was being
judged.

170
00:12:13,642 --> 00:12:16,642
I was doing it.

171
00:12:16,642 --> 00:12:18,642
I was doing it.

172
00:12:18,642 --> 00:12:20,642
I was doing it.

173
00:12:20,642 --> 00:12:22,642
I was doing it.

174
00:12:22,642 --> 00:12:24,642
I was doing it.

175
00:12:24,642 --> 00:12:26,642
I was doing it.

176
00:12:26,642 --> 00:12:28,848
I was doing it.

177
00:12:28,848 --> 00:12:33,288
I was always worried that I wasn't good
at singing,

178
00:12:33,448 --> 00:12:36,048
that I was being thought of,

179
00:12:36,208 --> 00:12:39,328
that I was being disappointed.

180
00:12:39,488 --> 00:12:45,488
I was always feeling a sense of
inferiority.

181
00:12:45,488 --> 00:12:49,872
It was hard for a while.

182
00:12:49,872 --> 00:12:55,872
Did you discover your singing skills
after you started singing live?

183
00:12:55,872 --> 00:12:56,872
Yes.

184
00:12:56,872 --> 00:12:58,872
Do you listen to your own music after
you sing?

185
00:12:58,872 --> 00:13:01,872
Yes, I do. I'm really depressed.

186
00:13:02,872 --> 00:13:07,872
That's the hardest part.

187
00:13:08,872 --> 00:13:14,872
I can't sing live because I can't keep
up with the video.

188
00:13:14,872 --> 00:13:18,144
I can't keep up with my own ideal.

189
00:13:18,144 --> 00:13:23,144
I don't sing 100% of the time.

190
00:13:23,144 --> 00:13:27,144
It's natural, but I wonder why I can't
do it.

191
00:13:27,144 --> 00:13:32,144
I feel that every time after a concert.

192
00:13:34,144 --> 00:13:38,144
During the final of the tour,

193
00:13:38,144 --> 00:13:43,144
I couldn't forget the concert in many
ways.

194
00:13:43,144 --> 00:13:47,280
I couldn't imagine the venue.

195
00:13:47,280 --> 00:13:50,280
There were so many people coming.

196
00:13:50,280 --> 00:13:52,280
And I was listening to my own voice.

197
00:13:52,280 --> 00:13:57,280
When I saw the situation where so many
people were coming,

198
00:13:57,280 --> 00:14:02,280
I was a little scared.

199
00:14:02,280 --> 00:14:09,280
I wanted to give 120% of my power.

200
00:14:09,280 --> 00:14:11,280
But it didn't work.

201
00:14:11,280 --> 00:14:14,280
After it was over,

202
00:14:14,280 --> 00:14:16,896
so many people came.

203
00:14:16,896 --> 00:14:18,736
They came to support me.

204
00:14:18,736 --> 00:14:22,256
The staff supported me so much.

205
00:14:22,256 --> 00:14:25,336
They supported me.

206
00:14:25,336 --> 00:14:28,776
I thought I might not have been able to
return it properly.

207
00:14:28,776 --> 00:14:33,656
I was pretty depressed at that time.

208
00:14:33,656 --> 00:14:36,656
It happens often.

209
00:14:36,656 --> 00:14:42,496
The reason for being depressed is...

210
00:14:42,496 --> 00:14:46,816
Singing and my individuality.

211
00:14:46,944 --> 00:14:50,944
I often feel depressed because of that.

212
00:14:50,944 --> 00:14:53,944
At that time, it was very terrible.

213
00:14:53,944 --> 00:14:59,944
I was so depressed that I couldn't get
up.

214
00:14:59,944 --> 00:15:03,944
But when I got into that situation,

215
00:15:03,944 --> 00:15:05,944
in my experience so far,

216
00:15:05,944 --> 00:15:10,944
I usually ran away from that weakness.

217
00:15:10,944 --> 00:15:16,896
So I thought I was going in a bad
direction.

218
00:15:16,896 --> 00:15:18,896
I thought I was going in a bad
direction.

219
00:15:20,896 --> 00:15:26,896
I said there weren't any vocalists or
songs that had influenced me in the
beginning.

220
00:15:26,896 --> 00:15:32,896
But since I started this activity, I've
met a vocalist I really respect.

221
00:15:32,896 --> 00:15:39,896
It's Leo, the vocalist of a band called
ARI.

222
00:15:39,896 --> 00:15:45,456
We're both in charge of the band.

223
00:15:45,456 --> 00:15:47,456
We've been getting along well.

224
00:15:47,456 --> 00:15:51,456
He's been thinking about me all the
time.

225
00:15:51,456 --> 00:15:57,456
He noticed that I was depressed with the
actor, Fujii Shuka,

226
00:15:57,456 --> 00:16:02,456
and they wrote me a very beautiful line.

227
00:16:02,456 --> 00:16:04,456
Oh, that's what it is.

228
00:16:04,456 --> 00:16:08,456
I have this routine before I do a live,

229
00:16:08,456 --> 00:16:11,456
so I thought it would be nice if we did
the same thing.

230
00:16:11,456 --> 00:16:11,664
Thank you for watching.

231
00:16:11,664 --> 00:16:13,664
He taught me from the beginning.

232
00:16:13,664 --> 00:16:17,664
No matter how bad I was, I couldn't go
back to the basics.

233
00:16:17,664 --> 00:16:23,664
Thanks to that, the live was getting
more and more fun.

234
00:16:23,664 --> 00:16:26,664
I was like, what should I have done?

235
00:16:26,664 --> 00:16:35,664
It's not just a word to say, but it's
like we're scooping up together.

236
00:16:35,664 --> 00:16:39,888
He always helped me a lot.

237
00:16:39,888 --> 00:16:48,888
I didn't think I'd meet a vocalist I
could respect so much.

238
00:16:48,888 --> 00:16:51,888
I was so moved when I went to see the
live performance.

239
00:16:51,888 --> 00:16:56,888
I thought I was singing so hard and it
was so heart-wrenching.

240
00:16:56,888 --> 00:17:00,888
I thought I had done a good job at the
live performance.

241
00:17:00,888 --> 00:17:05,888
I was thinking about my own mistakes and
I was looking for perfection.

242
00:17:05,888 --> 00:17:07,680
Live performances are...

243
00:17:07,680 --> 00:17:09,340
I wasn't in a place like that.

244
00:17:09,340 --> 00:17:13,720
I realized that I had to entertain the
audience

245
00:17:13,720 --> 00:17:16,180
because they were listening to my songs.

246
00:17:17,360 --> 00:17:22,220
I realized that I was too late.

247
00:17:22,220 --> 00:17:23,360
Wow.

248
00:17:23,360 --> 00:17:24,400
Yeah.

249
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:28,900
I realized that recording and making a
live performance are different.

250
00:17:28,900 --> 00:17:36,240
I realized that after a year.

251
00:17:41,690 --> 00:17:45,690
This title has many meanings.

252
00:17:45,690 --> 00:17:51,690
It means to fight against the night in
Japanese.

253
00:17:51,690 --> 00:17:56,690
I talked about the night in Side A.

254
00:17:56,690 --> 00:18:02,690
It's a song that symbolizes the night
that hit with the spring.

255
00:18:02,690 --> 00:18:07,690
It's a song that's included as a night
artist.

256
00:18:07,690 --> 00:18:11,690
It's a genre that's only for me.

257
00:18:11,808 --> 00:18:14,808
I want to be a part of that.

258
00:18:14,808 --> 00:18:20,088
So I want to deal with that first.

259
00:18:20,088 --> 00:18:23,128
I'm very pessimistic and lonely.

260
00:18:23,128 --> 00:18:27,808
I have to deal with my own weakness.

261
00:18:27,808 --> 00:18:31,608
I have to deal with my own weakness.

262
00:18:31,608 --> 00:18:36,728
I'm a hit singer who has been on the
show since the spring.

263
00:18:36,728 --> 00:18:39,120
I don't think I'm good enough to Joe
bisschen.

264
00:18:39,120 --> 00:18:43,120
I'm always worried that if I don't
release my own song,

265
00:18:43,120 --> 00:18:50,120
I'll end up with a single hit.

266
00:18:50,120 --> 00:18:54,120
I'm worried that I'll end up with a hit
song that will hit the spring,

267
00:18:54,120 --> 00:19:02,120
or that I'll have more songs that will
represent me.

268
00:19:02,120 --> 00:19:07,008
I think that's what's been on my mind
this year.

269
00:19:07,008 --> 00:19:10,468
There are many meanings to the title,

270
00:19:10,468 --> 00:19:13,468
but I thought I had to fight against the
night.

271
00:19:13,468 --> 00:19:16,468
That's why I chose this title.

272
00:19:16,468 --> 00:19:19,468
This year's battle is going to be a big
battle.

273
00:19:19,468 --> 00:19:23,468
I thought I could only put this title on
this year.

274
00:19:23,468 --> 00:19:26,968
I'm aware of the album,

275
00:19:26,968 --> 00:19:29,968
but I think there are many people who
write songs

276
00:19:29,968 --> 00:19:32,968
based on the theme of the album.

277
00:19:32,968 --> 00:19:35,664
I think there are many people who write
songs based on the theme of the album.

278
00:19:35,664 --> 00:19:41,164
We release songs that we want to sing at
different times.

279
00:19:41,164 --> 00:19:44,964
We release the album with the meaning of
a bundle.

280
00:19:44,964 --> 00:19:48,664
So, to be honest, we don't have a
uniformity.

281
00:19:48,664 --> 00:19:52,164
When we were thinking about how to put
the album title,

282
00:19:52,164 --> 00:19:59,864
we decided to put the album title on the
album that we wanted to achieve that
year.

283
00:19:59,864 --> 00:20:05,864
We thought we had to face the night.

284
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:10,000
So we decided to try writing songs.

285
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:14,000
That's amazing. I'm looking forward to
it.

286
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:19,000
It's a task for me.

287
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:21,000
I'm looking forward to it.

288
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:23,000
I'm looking forward to it too.

289
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:25,000
I'm sorry to say this many times,

290
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:33,984
but I don't think I have musical talent.

291
00:20:33,984 --> 00:20:39,484
Especially writing lyrics and composing
songs is a challenge.

292
00:20:39,484 --> 00:20:48,984
I think that if you keep working hard,
you can achieve something.

293
00:20:48,984 --> 00:20:55,984
But writing lyrics and composing songs
is difficult.

294
00:20:55,984 --> 00:20:59,484
I didn't adjust myself.

295
00:20:59,484 --> 00:21:03,792
I didn't try to escape from the night.

296
00:21:03,792 --> 00:21:08,792
I'm thinking of trying it out.

297
00:21:08,792 --> 00:21:11,792
I'm really just a normal person.

298
00:21:11,792 --> 00:21:18,792
I'm thinking about how many songs I can
make as a normal person.

299
00:21:18,792 --> 00:21:22,792
I can't say it's fun.

300
00:21:22,792 --> 00:21:25,792
I'm making it while worrying.

301
00:21:25,792 --> 00:21:33,792
I want to be in the same situation as
the current listeners.

302
00:21:33,936 --> 00:21:35,136
You're trying?

303
00:21:35,136 --> 00:21:36,136
Yes, I am.

304
00:21:36,136 --> 00:21:39,136
I'm really trying.

305
00:21:39,136 --> 00:21:43,136
I think I'm in the same situation as
everyone else.

306
00:21:43,136 --> 00:21:46,136
I don't know myself.

307
00:21:46,136 --> 00:21:50,936
I don't know myself.

308
00:21:50,936 --> 00:21:55,936
I don't know myself.

309
00:21:55,936 --> 00:21:58,936
I'm not like that.

310
00:21:58,936 --> 00:22:03,552
I'm trying my best to not be a one-shot
shot.

311
00:22:03,552 --> 00:22:06,352
I'm struggling right now.

312
00:22:06,352 --> 00:22:09,792
Maybe, for those who don't know,

313
00:22:09,792 --> 00:22:14,792
the song might be a hit and make them
happy.

314
00:22:14,792 --> 00:22:20,912
But I want to tell people that I'm doing
my best

315
00:22:20,912 --> 00:22:33,121
as a normal person.
