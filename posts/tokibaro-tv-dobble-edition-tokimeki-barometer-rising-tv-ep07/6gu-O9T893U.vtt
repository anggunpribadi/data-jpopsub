 I'm running through it recklessly

00:58.404 --> 01:04.904
 I keep engraving the meaning deep in my
heart

01:04.904 --> 01:08.904
 Actually, everyone is about to break
down

01:08.904 --> 01:12.904
 I hold back the spilling tears

01:12.904 --> 01:18.404
 But I still bite my teeth

01:18.404 --> 01:21.304
 Yes, recklessly

03:03.344 --> 03:05.344
 I didn't get a single point.

03:05.344 --> 03:07.344
 Let's go.

03:07.344 --> 03:17.344
 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11!

03:25.344 --> 03:29.344
 Hime-chan got 10 points.

03:29.344 --> 03:31.344
 That was close.

03:31.344 --> 03:36.344
 What will happen next?

03:36.666 --> 03:42.606
 I, fraudulence, embarrassing...

03:42.626 --> 03:43.806
 Shall we go?

03:43.806 --> 03:46.066
 Well, let's go on with what we said in
the practice room too.

03:48.306 --> 03:51.946
 Then, the improvisation...

03:51.946 --> 03:53.146
 The song?

03:53.146 --> 03:54.786
 The song is also fine, too.

03:57.186 --> 03:57.594
 It's the song of the rule of DoBullu-
kun.

03:57.594 --> 04:01.594
 3, 2, 1, action!

04:01.594 --> 04:07.594
 Double-pun is a palm-pon-pon

04:07.594 --> 04:11.594
 There's an eye in the middle

04:11.594 --> 04:15.594
 I'll explain the rules

04:15.594 --> 04:19.594

04:19.594 --> 04:23.594
 Give it to everyone and turn it over

04:23.594 --> 04:27.594
 Collect the cards in the middle

04:27.594 --> 04:31.594
 There it is! Double-pun!

04:56.810 --> 04:58.810
 I'm sorry.

04:58.810 --> 05:00.810
 I want you to sweat for a minute.

05:02.810 --> 05:04.810
 I want to give you a heart.

05:04.810 --> 05:06.810
 Everyone else is old.

05:08.810 --> 05:10.810
 The second challenge.

05:12.810 --> 05:14.810

06:02.504 --> 06:03.504
 Scissors?

06:03.504 --> 06:04.504
 Scissors?

06:06.504 --> 06:07.504
 A competition of each.

06:10.504 --> 06:11.504
 A paten.

06:12.504 --> 06:13.504

 Not a ball, what was it?

06:33.728 --> 06:34.728
 A ball.

06:34.728 --> 06:36.728
 What was it?

06:36.728 --> 06:37.728
 Light.

06:37.728 --> 06:38.728
 It's easy to explain.

06:38.728 --> 06:39.728

07:10.320 --> 07:11.320
 This is...

07:12.888 --> 07:14.888
 Wait, wait, I don't want to do this.

07:15.888 --> 07:16.888
 I don't know.

07:17.888 --> 07:18.888
 Ready, go.

07:29.888 --> 07:30.888
 Wait.

07:31.888 --> 07:32.888
 The last chance.

07:33.888 --> 07:35.888
 The last chance.

07:35.888 --> 07:37.888
 Well, then...

07:39.096 --> 07:42.096
 I'll tell you a story that never slips.

07:44.096 --> 07:46.096
 Well, well...

07:47.096 --> 07:54.096
 Hiyori's series of never-slipping is in
my cell phone.

07:55.096 --> 08:00.096
 Here is my sleeping collection.

08:01.096 --> 08:03.096
 I have a sleeping collection.

08:04.096 --> 08:06.096
 There is an app that can record.

08:06.096 --> 08:09.096
 I've been doing it for a while.

08:10.096 --> 08:12.096
 It's a long time ago.

08:12.096 --> 08:16.096
 I want to tell you about it.

08:16.096 --> 08:20.272
 Please listen to my sleeping
collection.

08:23.906 --> 08:25.906
 Bring me a toothbrush.

08:27.906 --> 08:29.906
 Bring me a toothbrush.

08:29.906 --> 08:31.906
 Bring me a toothbrush.

08:32.906 --> 08:34.906
 How was it?

08:36.906 --> 08:39.906
 It was a perfect sleep.

08:39.906 --> 08:41.906
 Mom, bring me a toothbrush.

08:43.906 --> 08:46.906
 I slept with a toothbrush.

08:46.906 --> 08:48.906
 I'm sorry.

08:54.906 --> 08:56.906
 We are in Hitoka.

08:59.906 --> 09:01.906
 We are in Hiroshima.

09:03.906 --> 09:05.906
 We ate Okonomiyaki.

09:05.906 --> 09:07.906
 It was delicious.

09:11.906 --> 09:14.906
 Okonomiyaki was delicious, but
hamburger was also delicious.

09:14.906 --> 09:17.906
 What did you talk about?

09:17.906 --> 09:19.906
 What did you talk about?

09:21.906 --> 09:24.906
 The bread was the best.

09:24.906 --> 09:26.906
 It was delicious.

09:26.906 --> 09:35.906
 Please subscribe to this channel.

09:36.410 --> 09:38.410
 And then,

09:38.410 --> 09:40.410
 we'll put it on Junon's heart.

09:42.410 --> 09:44.410
 Let's see everyone's mustache.

09:44.410 --> 09:46.410
 Did you do it?

09:46.410 --> 09:48.410
 Did you do it?

09:48.410 --> 09:50.410
 Did you do it?

09:50.410 --> 09:52.410
 I did it.

09:52.410 --> 09:54.410
 Is it okay? Is it cute even if I put it
on?

09:54.410 --> 09:56.410
 Yes.

09:56.410 --> 09:58.410
 One, two.

09:58.410 --> 10:00.410
 I'm going home.

10:00.410 --> 10:04.410
 Thank you for watching.

10:04.624 --> 10:07.624
 I'm in Fukuoka today.

10:07.624 --> 10:11.624
 I ate a hot pot yesterday.

10:11.624 --> 10:13.624
 I'm running.

10:13.624 --> 10:15.624
 I'm going to catch up.

10:27.624 --> 10:29.624
 Why don't you shoot?

10:30.624 --> 10:31.624
 It's okay.

10:31.624 --> 10:34.624
 There's something weird.

10:38.266 --> 10:40.266
 It's started!

10:40.266 --> 10:42.266
 YouTube!

10:42.266 --> 10:44.266
 What are you going to show us today?

10:47.354 --> 10:52.354
 This is the toothpick that Julia was
introducing.

10:52.354 --> 10:57.354
 It's a toothpick. It's useful for
various things.

10:57.354 --> 10:59.354
 Can you see it?

10:59.354 --> 11:03.354
 I'm going to edit this.

11:03.354 --> 11:05.354
 It's like this.

11:05.354 --> 11:07.354
 How much is it?

11:07.354 --> 11:09.354
 381 yen.

11:09.354 --> 11:10.354
 Expensive!

11:10.354 --> 11:12.354
 The highest class.

11:12.354 --> 11:14.354
 What is this?

11:14.354 --> 11:16.720
 It's a toothpick.

11:17.720 --> 11:19.720
 Toothpicks are in fashion now.

11:20.720 --> 11:22.720
 It's a good style for fashion.

11:23.720 --> 11:25.720
 It's a good style.

11:28.720 --> 11:30.720
 I want to introduce it.

11:30.720 --> 11:33.720
 I want to do it. Good luck today.

 There are a lot of things.

12:10.328 --> 12:13.328
 And we appeared on the Jet Coaster.

12:15.328 --> 12:17.328
 Will it really be?

12:17.328 --> 12:21.328
 I'm more nervous than the live.

12:21.328 --> 12:23.328
 I'm not good at it.

12:23.328 --> 12:25.328
 I'm sorry.

12:25.328 --> 12:27.328
 I'm not good at it.

12:27.328 --> 12:29.328
 What will happen?

12:29.328 --> 12:32.328
 But it's free time.

12:33.784 --> 12:35.784
 I'm sorry. I'm really sorry.

12:35.784 --> 12:37.784
 I might have been too loud.

12:37.784 --> 12:38.784
 I'm sorry.

12:38.784 --> 12:41.784
 But did you enjoy it?

 Everybody felt just like today!

13:08.430 --> 13:11.490
 And today, we all have different faces.

13:11.490 --> 13:17.530
 And different pictures.

13:18.990 --> 13:21.150
 Cute!

13:21.150 --> 13:22.290
 Portraits.

13:22.290 --> 13:25.070
 Wow look!

13:25.070 --> 13:26.770
 It's surprising!
