It's amazing, you can feel the love, and even so, staff Y is disappointed! The 99th period of the big announcement

This time Hachamecha Gakuen gathers members and Amano Anna in the studio
Looking back on the past of Hachacha Gakuen with the important announcement

- This document is not great, the program outline is all written in order
- Nao-chan's rampage, Baby's 16th period, Okazaki's glamping where the earthworm incident occurred,
- The Kariya location where Ho-chan became a botch, the TV Aichi festival where Ho-chan really ran,
- A surprise cake for a Christmas party, close contact with a live performance...
- Now that I think about it, it was fun, Aoharu
- By the way, who came up with "Hachamecha Gakuen" in the first place? Actually, it started with what 〇〇 wrote in the memo, but I forgot...
- By the way, what's the big announcement? Eh, even though you already know
