1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Night Camp Idol!

2
00:00:03,834 --> 00:00:09,834
The second one is Netflix.

3
00:00:09,834 --> 00:00:12,834
The second one is Netflix.

4
00:00:12,834 --> 00:00:15,834
Why did you decide to appear in this
program?

5
00:00:15,834 --> 00:00:16,834
This is...

6
00:00:16,834 --> 00:00:17,834
What is it?

7
00:00:17,834 --> 00:00:20,834
I just said it earlier.

8
00:00:20,834 --> 00:00:22,834
There's one thing I want to do.

9
00:00:22,834 --> 00:00:24,834
I've always had a dream.

10
00:00:24,834 --> 00:00:27,834
I want to appear in a Netflix original
drama.

11
00:00:27,834 --> 00:00:29,834
Oh!

12
00:00:29,834 --> 00:00:30,834
Yes.

13
00:00:30,834 --> 00:00:31,834
That's good.

14
00:00:31,834 --> 00:00:32,834
Yes.

15
00:00:32,834 --> 00:00:35,834
I hope that dream comes true someday.

16
00:00:35,834 --> 00:00:41,834
I watch Netflix when I have time.

17
00:00:41,834 --> 00:00:44,834
I've been watching it lately.

18
00:00:44,834 --> 00:00:47,834
I'll introduce it to you.

19
00:00:47,834 --> 00:00:50,834
Please recommend this program.

20
00:00:50,834 --> 00:00:54,834
I recently watched a movie called
Revenge Swap.

21
00:00:54,834 --> 00:00:56,834
Revenge Swap?

22
00:00:56,834 --> 00:00:59,834
It's a movie.

23
00:00:59,834 --> 00:01:09,834
It's a movie that crushes a person who
has messed up his student life.

24
00:01:09,834 --> 00:01:11,834
I see.

25
00:01:11,834 --> 00:01:14,834
That's what it's about.

26
00:01:14,834 --> 00:01:23,834
I also watched the Halloween spell
Bridge Hollow is a big deal.

27
00:01:23,834 --> 00:01:28,834
The spirit of Halloween is in the
Halloween kimono.

28
00:01:28,834 --> 00:01:29,834
That's good.

29
00:01:29,834 --> 00:01:35,834
I also like the movie Clueless.

30
00:01:35,834 --> 00:01:36,834
Clueless?

31
00:01:36,834 --> 00:01:37,834
Yes.

32
00:01:37,834 --> 00:01:41,696
The girl who turned into a corpse?

33
00:01:42,696 --> 00:01:46,696
I see, so you're talking about your
private life.

34
00:01:46,696 --> 00:01:49,696
Yes, I'm like a party person.

35
00:01:51,696 --> 00:01:56,696
I've also started watching Jyarinko
Chie.

36
00:01:56,696 --> 00:01:57,696
Jyarinko Chie?

37
00:01:57,696 --> 00:01:58,696
Yes, I've started watching it.

38
00:01:58,696 --> 00:02:01,696
Jyarinko Chie? Is that the old Jyarinko
Chie?

39
00:02:01,696 --> 00:02:05,696
Yes, I've been watching the rerun of
Jyarinko Chie.

40
00:02:05,696 --> 00:02:11,696
The only anime I remember is Jyarinko
Chie.

41
00:02:11,696 --> 00:02:14,696
So I've been watching it recently.

42
00:02:14,696 --> 00:02:18,696
I'd like to introduce the ones on my
playlist.

43
00:02:18,696 --> 00:02:21,696
Is it okay to tell me about them?

44
00:02:21,696 --> 00:02:26,696
The Korean drama called, The Lawyer is a
Genius.

45
00:02:26,696 --> 00:02:31,696
I'd like to start watching it soon.

46
00:02:31,696 --> 00:02:35,696
The strongest running plan.

47
00:02:35,696 --> 00:02:37,696
I'd like to watch the 42nd episode.

48
00:02:37,696 --> 00:02:40,696
The story of a man who changed the
world.

49
00:02:40,696 --> 00:02:41,696
What's that?

50
00:02:41,696 --> 00:02:42,696
Is it about baseball?

51
00:02:42,696 --> 00:02:47,696
Yes, it's about a man who became a major
leaguer.

52
00:02:47,696 --> 00:02:54,696
He changes the history of baseball in
the midst of discrimination.

53
00:02:54,696 --> 00:02:56,696
It was really interesting.

54
00:02:56,696 --> 00:03:01,696
It's a legendary movie about the history
of baseball.

55
00:03:01,696 --> 00:03:02,696
I see.

56
00:03:02,696 --> 00:03:08,696
I think it's really interesting.

57
00:03:08,696 --> 00:03:13,696
I think most baseball fans have watched
it.

58
00:03:13,696 --> 00:03:17,696
But it's a movie that will resonate with
those who don't know much about
baseball.

59
00:03:17,696 --> 00:03:23,696
I've watched this movie many times.

60
00:03:23,696 --> 00:03:24,696
It's Coco Chanel.

61
00:03:24,696 --> 00:03:26,696
I'd like you to watch it.

62
00:03:26,696 --> 00:03:33,696
I was really impressed by the way Chanel
lived.

63
00:03:33,696 --> 00:03:41,696
I went to Chanel and asked the store
clerk what the meaning of the cosmetics
was.

64
00:03:41,696 --> 00:03:46,696
I asked the store clerk how the letters
of the perfume were arranged.

65
00:03:46,696 --> 00:03:49,696
Does the Chanel store clerk know that?

66
00:03:49,696 --> 00:03:51,696
Yes, she knows and tells me everything.

67
00:03:51,696 --> 00:03:56,696
Especially, the perfume has a story and
meaning.

68
00:03:56,696 --> 00:04:01,696
I'm really happy to hear that.

69
00:04:01,696 --> 00:04:03,696
I'm impressed.

70
00:04:03,696 --> 00:04:05,696
I think so, too.

71
00:04:05,696 --> 00:04:12,696
There is a perfume called Boy by Chanel.

72
00:04:12,696 --> 00:04:18,696
If you know the story of Chanel, you
will be more like Chanel.

73
00:04:18,696 --> 00:04:21,696
Please ask the store clerk.

74
00:04:23,752 --> 00:04:25,752
What is the most embarrassing thing
you've ever done?

75
00:04:25,752 --> 00:04:30,752
I'm embarrassed if I say it in Kanagawa
Prefecture.

76
00:04:30,752 --> 00:04:34,948
What is the most embarrassing thing
you've ever done?
