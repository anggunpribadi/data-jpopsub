00:00.250 --> 00:02.250
 Ta-da!

00:02.250 --> 00:04.250
 You're being filmed!

00:04.250 --> 00:06.250
 I am!

00:06.250 --> 00:08.250
 How do I look?

00:08.250 --> 00:10.250
 I'm a zombie!

00:10.250 --> 00:12.250
 But this flower thing is cute!

00:12.250 --> 00:14.250
 It's amazing!

00:14.250 --> 00:16.250
 There's also a bear!

00:16.250 --> 00:18.250
 It's covered in blood!

00:18.250 --> 00:20.192
 Yay!

00:21.192 --> 00:23.192
 How was Halloween?

00:23.192 --> 00:25.192
 It's a month early.

00:26.192 --> 00:27.192
 What?

00:29.192 --> 00:32.192
 Yeah, it's a month early.

00:32.192 --> 00:34.192
 It's a little early.

00:34.192 --> 00:37.192
 Everyone was inspired by the pro.

00:37.192 --> 00:38.192
 Yeah, yeah.

00:38.192 --> 00:40.192
 So, zombies are like,

00:40.192 --> 00:42.192
 I'm going to make this kind of wound.

00:42.192 --> 00:44.192
 I'm going to make this kind of wound.

00:44.192 --> 00:46.192
 There are other types of wounds.

00:46.192 --> 00:47.192
 There are many types of wounds.

00:47.192 --> 00:49.192
 My mouth is open.

00:49.192 --> 00:51.192
 I don't want to do it.

00:51.192 --> 00:53.192
 It's amazing.

00:53.192 --> 00:54.192
 But I'm going to make it.

00:54.192 --> 00:55.192
 I'm going to make it.

00:55.192 --> 00:57.754
 Yeah.

00:57.754 --> 00:59.754
 Bye bye!

 Open an album

01:25.034 --> 01:27.394
 methods

01:27.834 --> 01:30.874
 Made last fall

01:30.874 --> 01:34.874
 Don't make me laugh, I'm in a good mood

01:36.240 --> 01:38.240
 Let's go!

01:38.240 --> 01:41.240
 Tutturu tutturu tuttu

01:41.240 --> 01:43.240
 Tutturu tutturu tuttu

01:43.240 --> 01:45.240
 Departure!

01:45.240 --> 01:49.240
 Today, we had an autograph session at
Tsutaya Shibuya!

01:49.240 --> 01:51.240
 Yeah!

01:51.240 --> 01:52.240
 How was it?

01:52.240 --> 01:53.240
 Hiyori-san

01:53.240 --> 01:58.240
 Everyone was so busy going home from
work and school

01:58.240 --> 02:01.240
 So we were able to write a lot of
autographs!

02:01.240 --> 02:02.240
 Yeah!

02:02.240 --> 02:04.240
 Good job on your work and school!

02:04.240 --> 02:05.240
 Good job!

02:05.240 --> 02:07.240
 It was fun talking to you!

02:07.240 --> 02:11.240
 We talked so much that we got late!
Sorry!

02:11.240 --> 02:12.240
 I talked a lot too!

02:12.240 --> 02:15.240
 There were so many things we wanted to
talk about!

02:15.240 --> 02:17.240
 I'm not good at talking!

02:19.160 --> 02:21.160
 She's cute!

02:24.160 --> 02:27.160
 My ponytail is a bit short today.

02:28.160 --> 02:30.160
 Your hair is short.

02:32.160 --> 02:34.160
 And I have a sense of touch.

02:35.160 --> 02:37.160
 Which one do you like?

02:37.160 --> 02:38.160
 My sense of touch.

02:38.160 --> 02:43.160
 Please subscribe to my channel!

02:43.824 --> 02:46.824
 I want you to try this.

02:46.824 --> 02:50.824
 Put this on the vertical.

02:50.824 --> 02:51.824
 OK.

02:52.824 --> 02:54.824
 No, the other way.

02:57.824 --> 02:58.824
 Can I stand on this?

02:59.824 --> 03:00.824
 It's difficult.

03:02.824 --> 03:03.824
 Is it difficult?

03:03.824 --> 03:04.824
 Did you do it?

03:04.824 --> 03:05.824
 Yes, I did.

03:05.824 --> 03:07.824
 And put the silver on it.

03:07.824 --> 03:13.824
 Put the silver on it.

03:13.824 --> 03:15.386
 Please subscribe to my channel!

03:15.386 --> 03:17.386
 Shhh!

03:17.386 --> 03:19.386
 Bye-bye!

03:19.386 --> 03:21.386
 Bye-bye!

03:21.386 --> 03:23.386
 I look like a purple.

03:23.386 --> 03:25.386
 You do.

03:25.386 --> 03:27.386
 You do.

03:27.386 --> 03:29.386
 I look like a blue.

03:29.386 --> 03:31.386
 Bye-bye!

03:31.386 --> 03:33.386
 Can you hear me?

03:33.386 --> 03:35.386
 Yes.

03:35.386 --> 03:37.386
 I can't hear you.

03:37.386 --> 03:39.386
 I just want to talk to you.

03:39.386 --> 03:41.386
 What?

03:41.386 --> 03:43.386
 What?

03:43.386 --> 03:44.506
 Bye-bye!

03:44.506 --> 03:46.506
 I'm going to the movie.

03:48.506 --> 03:50.506
 Hello.

03:50.506 --> 03:52.506
 Wait a minute.

03:52.506 --> 03:54.506
 Welcome.

03:58.506 --> 04:00.506
 Thank you.

04:02.506 --> 04:04.506
 I haven't seen you lately.

04:04.506 --> 04:06.506
 I'm going to the movie.

04:06.506 --> 04:08.794
 Thank you for your viewing.

04:08.794 --> 04:10.794
 Thank you. I love you.

04:10.794 --> 04:12.794
 Thank you. I love you.

04:20.122 --> 04:22.122
 The wind suits you.

04:23.122 --> 04:25.122
 This is definitely not good.

04:25.122 --> 04:26.122
 It's not cool.

04:27.122 --> 04:28.122
 My ears are going to burst.

04:28.122 --> 04:49.024
 It's good.

04:50.024 --> 04:51.024
 I'm shooting a video.

04:52.024 --> 04:54.024
 I'm shooting a scene of punching.

04:55.024 --> 04:56.024
 You're good at it.

04:57.024 --> 04:59.024
 I'm training it.

04:59.024 --> 05:01.024
 I'm going to continue.

05:02.024 --> 05:03.024
 Punch.

05:04.024 --> 05:05.024
 I'm going to continue.

05:05.024 --> 05:18.024
 Hello, everyone.

05:18.400 --> 05:22.400
 Lock on to your heart. We are HAKIMIX.

05:39.290 --> 05:41.290
 I did it!

05:47.290 --> 05:50.290
 Hey, is the mic on?

05:50.290 --> 05:52.290
 Yes, it is!

05:53.290 --> 05:56.290
 It's a little lonely without music.

05:57.290 --> 06:07.290
 Thank you for coming to the release day
of the release event of A-MEX second
single, C-POP.

06:07.290 --> 06:09.290
 Thank you very much!

06:12.506 --> 06:17.506
 I'd like to talk about each of them one
by one.

06:18.506 --> 06:26.506
 This time, the Apex Second Single was
recorded in five songs.

06:27.506 --> 06:33.506
 For me, there were songs that were
really a dream, songs that I could stand
on.

06:33.506 --> 06:44.506
 I've been working hard to achieve my
goal, so I'm glad that everyone was
happy with me.

06:45.506 --> 06:52.506
 I'm really happy that you said a lot of
things like, I'll do my best. Thank you.

06:53.506 --> 07:00.506
 I'm still not good enough for everyone,
and there are still a lot of things I
have to work on.

07:00.506 --> 07:07.506
 But I'll do my best to sing and sing
and deliver my feelings to everyone.

07:08.506 --> 07:10.506
 Please continue to support me.

07:11.506 --> 07:17.506
 And I was really happy to be able to
get the second place with everyone.

07:17.506 --> 07:23.984
 Thank you everyone.

07:24.984 --> 07:27.984
 Thank you everyone for coming today.

07:28.984 --> 07:36.984
 I'm so happy to be ranked No.2 on the
Amex Second Single Coin Shape Up.

07:36.984 --> 07:42.984
 I'm so happy that each and every one of
you here is supporting us.

07:42.984 --> 07:44.984
 Thank you so much.

07:44.984 --> 07:49.984
 This No.2 is a great result.

07:49.984 --> 07:59.984
 I hope that we can continue to move
forward to a better future.

07:59.984 --> 08:06.490
 Do you like Tokusen?

08:06.490 --> 08:09.490
 Do you want to have the best live with
us?

08:11.490 --> 08:15.490
 Do you want to make a legendary live at
Nakano SunPlus?

08:16.490 --> 08:19.490
 Thank you very much. Please follow us
anywhere.

08:19.490 --> 08:24.336
 Thank you very much for today.

08:25.336 --> 08:26.336
 This time...

08:26.336 --> 08:27.336
 Thank you.

08:27.336 --> 08:36.336
 This time, I was very happy to receive
the second place in the Apex Second
Season.

08:36.336 --> 08:43.336
 I was very happy, so I proudly told my
mom that I was second place.

08:43.336 --> 08:48.336
 Then, she said she cried because she
watched the live stream.

08:48.336 --> 08:54.336
 I heard my mom crying and I almost
cried.

08:54.336 --> 08:58.336
 But my mom told me,

08:58.336 --> 09:02.336
 Until you become first place, you
should stop crying.

09:02.336 --> 09:07.336
 I will aim for the first place next
time and do my best.

09:07.336 --> 09:11.336
 But really, so many people came to the
release day,

09:11.336 --> 09:13.336
 despite the weekday.

09:13.336 --> 09:16.336
 I was really happy.

09:16.336 --> 09:19.336
 There is also Nakano-san Plaza.

09:19.336 --> 09:25.336
 We will do our best to continue to make
good progress.

09:25.336 --> 09:28.336
 I would be happy if you could follow
us.

09:28.336 --> 09:34.336
 And I would be happy if you could
forgive the new members.

09:34.336 --> 09:36.336
 Thank you very much for today.

09:36.336 --> 09:39.336
 Please be careful not to catch a cold.

09:39.336 --> 09:45.336
 First of all, thank you all for coming
today.

09:45.336 --> 09:47.336
 Thank you very much.

09:49.336 --> 09:53.336
 This was my second single.

09:53.336 --> 09:58.336
 I was able to receive the second place
in the Oricon Daily Ranking

09:58.336 --> 10:00.336
 with the lead song,

10:00.336 --> 10:04.336
 thanks to the promoters who supported
me.

10:04.336 --> 10:06.336
 Thank you very much.

10:06.336 --> 10:09.336
 I will continue to improve my skills.

10:09.336 --> 10:13.336
 I would like to make today's show a
turning point.

10:13.336 --> 10:18.336
 I would like to continue to connect
with the future

10:18.336 --> 10:22.336
 by holding Nakano Sun Plaza on December
21, 2019.

10:22.336 --> 10:32.922
 I will do my best, so please support
me.

10:32.922 --> 10:45.922
 Everyone, I know that we have been
given the 2nd place, but I still don't
feel it.

10:45.922 --> 10:48.922
 I feel it.

10:49.922 --> 10:54.922
 I'm telling everyone now. I feel it.

10:54.922 --> 11:04.922
 I feel it, and I don't know if I feel
it, but TokiSan is...

11:04.922 --> 11:09.922
 How do I say this? It's crazy. TokiSan
is going to be famous.

11:09.922 --> 11:12.922
 What should I do?

11:12.922 --> 11:16.922
 Will you continue to follow us?

11:16.922 --> 11:18.922
 Yes!

11:19.642 --> 11:20.642
 Thank you very much.

11:20.642 --> 11:22.642
 So, I really...

11:22.642 --> 11:23.642
 Ah, 2nd place.

11:24.642 --> 11:26.642
 I wonder if I'm not in the right frame.

11:26.642 --> 11:27.642
 I'm sorry.

11:28.642 --> 11:33.642
 I really want to thank you for giving
me 2nd place today.

11:37.642 --> 11:38.642
 Thank you very much.

11:38.642 --> 11:42.170
 I'm fine!

11:42.170 --> 11:45.170
 I'm a bit of a Cinderella.

11:45.170 --> 11:48.170
 I'm a Cinderella, so I'm a bit funny.

11:51.170 --> 11:54.170
 I don't think I'm a Cinderella.

12:05.170 --> 12:10.170
 I want to perform live with a lot of
fun and excitement.

12:10.170 --> 12:13.170
 I'll definitely show you a more
powerful side than last year.

12:13.170 --> 12:18.170
 I'm really sorry that the publicity
company that supports us is really in
the way.

12:18.170 --> 12:22.170
 Our story has just begun.

12:22.170 --> 12:29.170
 I think that there is no limit to the
possibilities and there is no limit to
the possibilities.

12:29.170 --> 12:32.170
 If you're with the publicity company
and the members,

12:32.170 --> 12:40.170
 we believe that we can definitely make
a big wall into a small wall.

12:40.170 --> 12:45.264
 So, please wait for us, Nakano-san and
Kuro-san!

12:45.264 --> 12:47.924
 Please watch it a lot!

13:02.608 --> 13:09.608
 I'll show you how to bloom, the big
petals

13:09.608 --> 13:13.608
 I'll run through it recklessly, always

13:13.608 --> 13:20.608
 I'll engrave the meaning deep in my
heart

13:20.608 --> 13:26.758
 It's really over, everyone, everyone,
it's about to collapse

13:27.758 --> 13:32.758
 It's really over, everyone, everyone,
it's about to collapse

13:32.758 --> 13:58.758
 It's really over, everyone, everyone,
it's about to collapse

13:59.066 --> 14:04.066
 If you're in love, shake up, shake up,
shake a lick, shake up

14:04.066 --> 14:07.066
 Aim for the weight, ring, sacre bleu

14:07.066 --> 14:13.066
 Lose weight, lose weight, lose weight,
don't lose your health

14:13.066 --> 14:17.066
 Let's go, do me, do me, yo! Do me, do
me, yo!

14:17.066 --> 14:20.066
 Don't show me your true feelings

14:20.066 --> 14:23.066
 Do me, do me, yo! Do me, do me, yo!

14:23.066 --> 14:29.066
 Don't make a fool of me, I'm in the
middle of a relationship
