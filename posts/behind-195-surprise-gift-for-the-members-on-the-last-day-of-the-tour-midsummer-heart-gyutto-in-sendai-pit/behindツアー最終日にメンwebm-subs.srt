1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,000
Thank you.

2
00:00:15,482 --> 00:00:18,482
The dance is getting more and more
difficult

3
00:00:18,482 --> 00:00:21,482
I'm so tired

4
00:00:25,482 --> 00:00:26,482
What kind of choreography is it?

5
00:00:26,482 --> 00:00:28,482
The choreography for the future

6
00:00:29,482 --> 00:00:30,482
I forgot

7
00:00:30,482 --> 00:00:32,482
There is no choreography for the future

8
00:00:32,482 --> 00:00:34,482
I can use it

9
00:00:36,482 --> 00:00:38,482
The choreography for the future

10
00:00:38,482 --> 00:00:41,482
The choreography for the future

11
00:00:41,482 --> 00:00:42,746
The choreography for the future

12
00:00:43,546 --> 00:00:45,166
Up up up...

13
00:00:45,366 --> 00:00:46,206
What?

14
00:00:46,206 --> 00:00:47,546
Ah ah ah.

15
00:00:47,546 --> 00:00:49,546
What?

16
00:00:49,546 --> 00:00:51,546
What?

17
00:00:51,546 --> 00:00:53,546
What?

18
00:00:53,546 --> 00:00:55,546
What?

19
00:00:55,546 --> 00:00:59,930
What?

20
00:00:59,930 --> 00:01:01,930
Wow!

21
00:01:03,930 --> 00:01:05,930
I can't stop eating!

22
00:01:07,930 --> 00:01:08,930
Really?

23
00:01:08,930 --> 00:01:10,930
Look! Look!

24
00:01:10,930 --> 00:01:12,930
Look!

25
00:01:12,930 --> 00:01:14,930
This is the best!

26
00:01:15,930 --> 00:01:18,930
This is a must-have item for a bare
face.

27
00:01:18,930 --> 00:01:20,930
Even glasses can be seen.

28
00:01:20,930 --> 00:01:21,930
Wow!

29
00:01:21,930 --> 00:01:22,930
Yay!

30
00:01:22,930 --> 00:01:25,850
Thank you for watching!

31
00:01:25,850 --> 00:01:27,850
I recommend it a lot.

32
00:01:27,850 --> 00:01:29,850
Let's eat it.

33
00:01:29,850 --> 00:01:31,850
It looks delicious.

34
00:01:31,850 --> 00:01:33,850
It looks like a fake.

35
00:01:33,850 --> 00:01:35,850
I was surprised.

36
00:01:35,850 --> 00:01:37,850
It's shaking.

37
00:01:39,850 --> 00:01:41,850
Hello.

38
00:01:41,850 --> 00:01:43,850
You did a great job.

39
00:01:43,850 --> 00:01:45,850
Thank you.

40
00:01:47,850 --> 00:01:49,850
Wait a minute.

41
00:01:49,850 --> 00:01:51,850
It's amazing.

42
00:01:51,850 --> 00:01:55,850
It's amazing.

43
00:01:55,850 --> 00:01:58,106
It's amazing.

44
00:01:58,106 --> 00:02:00,106
It smells so good!

45
00:02:00,106 --> 00:02:02,106
Smells so good!

46
00:02:02,106 --> 00:02:04,106
It's so good!

47
00:02:04,106 --> 00:02:06,106
Smells so good!

48
00:02:06,106 --> 00:02:08,106
We can't smell it.

49
00:02:08,106 --> 00:02:10,106
We can't smell it.

50
00:02:10,106 --> 00:02:21,338
Can we eat it now?

51
00:02:21,338 --> 00:02:23,338
I don't think there's anything for me.

52
00:02:27,338 --> 00:02:28,338
I didn't say anything.

53
00:02:29,338 --> 00:02:30,338
I just saw a red and green person.

54
00:02:32,338 --> 00:02:36,338
I was just passing by and I saw
something.

55
00:02:36,338 --> 00:02:39,338
There was a drink and a lunch box.

56
00:02:40,338 --> 00:02:42,338
I was wondering what it was.

57
00:02:42,338 --> 00:02:43,338
I found it.

58
00:02:44,338 --> 00:02:45,338
You found it?

59
00:02:45,338 --> 00:02:50,976
Thank you very much.

60
00:02:50,976 --> 00:02:52,976
This is the best.

61
00:02:56,976 --> 00:02:59,976
Please have a seat.

62
00:03:01,976 --> 00:03:03,976
This is not for one person.

63
00:03:03,976 --> 00:03:05,976
Is this for one person?

64
00:03:05,976 --> 00:03:07,976
This is a feast.

65
00:03:08,976 --> 00:03:10,976
Thank you very much.

66
00:03:10,976 --> 00:03:12,976
Thank you very much.

67
00:03:12,976 --> 00:03:15,600
Let's go.

68
00:03:15,600 --> 00:03:17,600
It's shining.

69
00:03:17,600 --> 00:03:21,600
Please notice this shine.

70
00:03:21,600 --> 00:03:23,600
It's a shiny one.

71
00:03:23,600 --> 00:03:25,600
Please take a picture of me.

72
00:03:27,600 --> 00:03:29,600
It's beautiful.

73
00:03:33,600 --> 00:03:35,600
It's a portrait.

74
00:03:35,600 --> 00:03:37,600
It's a portrait and a beef jerky.

75
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:39,600
It's the best.

76
00:03:39,600 --> 00:03:41,600
Let's eat.

77
00:03:41,600 --> 00:03:44,016
I'm going to eat.

78
00:03:44,016 --> 00:03:45,016
Let's eat.

79
00:03:45,016 --> 00:03:46,016
I'm going to eat.

80
00:03:46,016 --> 00:03:48,016
Wow, it's the best.

81
00:03:48,016 --> 00:03:50,016
Let's eat.

82
00:03:50,016 --> 00:03:51,016
Let's eat.

83
00:03:51,016 --> 00:03:52,016
Thank you.

84
00:03:52,016 --> 00:03:53,016
Thank you.

85
00:03:53,016 --> 00:03:58,010
Let's eat.

86
00:03:58,010 --> 00:04:00,010
Let's eat!

87
00:04:01,010 --> 00:04:03,010
Yummy!

88
00:04:04,010 --> 00:04:06,010
It's soft and delicious!

89
00:04:06,010 --> 00:04:12,986
Please subscribe to my channel!

90
00:04:12,986 --> 00:04:14,986
I'm impressed.

91
00:04:14,986 --> 00:04:28,538
I'm impressed. It's delicious.

92
00:04:28,538 --> 00:04:34,538
It's soft and chewy.

93
00:04:34,538 --> 00:04:36,538
It's a little bit chewy.

94
00:04:36,538 --> 00:04:38,538
It's very oily.

95
00:04:38,538 --> 00:04:42,538
And it's crispy.

96
00:04:42,538 --> 00:04:44,538
I like the smell of charcoal.

97
00:04:44,538 --> 00:04:46,538
It's so good.

98
00:04:46,538 --> 00:04:51,194
It's the best.

99
00:04:51,194 --> 00:04:54,194
It's like eating in real life.

100
00:04:54,194 --> 00:04:57,194
It's a totally different store.

101
00:04:58,194 --> 00:05:00,194
It's so good!

102
00:05:03,194 --> 00:05:05,194
Can I eat it?

103
00:05:06,194 --> 00:05:09,194
The sea urchin that you eat in the sea
is so good!

104
00:05:11,194 --> 00:05:13,194
You look so happy!

105
00:05:13,194 --> 00:05:25,194
You look so happy!

106
00:05:25,850 --> 00:05:27,850
I wonder what it is.

107
00:05:31,850 --> 00:05:32,850
It was great.

108
00:05:33,850 --> 00:05:34,850
How many times do we have to go?

109
00:05:34,850 --> 00:05:35,850
We have to go many times.

110
00:05:36,850 --> 00:05:37,850
It's really good.

111
00:05:38,850 --> 00:05:40,850
There is a tail soup.

112
00:05:41,850 --> 00:05:43,850
There is a cat over there.

113
00:05:43,850 --> 00:05:44,850
How can I get there?

114
00:05:44,850 --> 00:05:46,850
I don't know.

115
00:05:50,850 --> 00:05:51,850
My eyes!

116
00:05:51,850 --> 00:05:53,850
I can't see it.

117
00:05:53,850 --> 00:05:57,434
I'm hiding it.

118
00:05:57,434 --> 00:05:59,434
Driver, thank you so much for using my
carì

119
00:06:00,754 --> 00:06:01,794
You Carnegie

120
00:06:04,474 --> 00:06:05,694
I kh的時候

121
00:06:05,694 --> 00:06:08,834
Thank you for watching so far. See you
next time with a delicious video.

122
00:06:08,858 --> 00:06:10,858
Soup

123
00:06:10,858 --> 00:06:12,858
Yay!

124
00:06:12,858 --> 00:06:14,858
I ate it

125
00:06:14,858 --> 00:06:16,858
Yay!

126
00:06:16,858 --> 00:06:18,858
This is good

127
00:06:18,858 --> 00:06:20,858
I ate it

128
00:06:22,858 --> 00:06:25,858
Yay! Today I'm the first one to put on
makeup

129
00:06:25,858 --> 00:06:29,858
I always put on makeup at the end, but
today I'm the first one

130
00:06:29,858 --> 00:06:31,858
Sideburns

131
00:06:31,858 --> 00:06:36,858
I know that everyone is nervous

132
00:06:38,234 --> 00:06:40,234
Oh, there's soup.

133
00:06:40,234 --> 00:06:42,234
Oh, what soup was it?

134
00:06:42,234 --> 00:06:44,234
Haru-be-san, what soup?

135
00:06:44,234 --> 00:06:46,234
Ponkotan soup. What was it?

136
00:06:46,234 --> 00:06:48,234
What was it?

137
00:06:48,234 --> 00:06:50,234
The one with meat.

138
00:06:50,234 --> 00:06:52,234
Tamegetan soup?

139
00:06:52,234 --> 00:06:54,234
No, I forgot the name.

140
00:06:54,234 --> 00:06:56,234
I'm wearing a hat today.

141
00:06:56,234 --> 00:06:58,234
I'm going to be a wetty.

142
00:07:02,234 --> 00:07:04,234
It's a Pankaji of Tokisai.

143
00:07:04,234 --> 00:07:06,234
I'm going to be a wetty.

144
00:07:06,234 --> 00:07:08,640
Gray is cute.

145
00:07:08,640 --> 00:07:11,640
A cat adopted.

146
00:07:23,930 --> 00:07:31,930
I heard the voice of joy when I did my
makeup.

147
00:07:34,930 --> 00:07:36,930
I wonder what it is.

148
00:07:37,930 --> 00:07:39,930
Will it happen from now on?

149
00:07:40,930 --> 00:07:44,930
I'm happy to know that it's a little
bit.

150
00:07:44,930 --> 00:07:47,930
Because it's a little bit strange over
there.

151
00:07:47,930 --> 00:07:50,736
I'll make you smell it.

152
00:07:50,736 --> 00:07:52,736
I'll make you eat delicious soup.

153
00:07:52,736 --> 00:07:54,736
Let's change clothes.

154
00:07:56,736 --> 00:07:58,736
Where is the green onion?

155
00:07:58,736 --> 00:08:00,736
Where is that green onion?

156
00:08:04,736 --> 00:08:06,736
Oh, outside.

157
00:08:06,736 --> 00:08:08,736
Outside?

158
00:08:08,736 --> 00:08:10,736
Wow!

159
00:08:10,736 --> 00:08:12,736
Awesome!

160
00:08:12,736 --> 00:08:14,736
Akina's tree.

161
00:08:14,736 --> 00:08:16,736
Wow!

162
00:08:16,736 --> 00:08:18,736
It's good.

163
00:08:18,736 --> 00:08:20,448
The end.

164
00:08:20,448 --> 00:08:22,448
It's great.

165
00:08:22,448 --> 00:08:24,448
It's being grilled.

166
00:08:24,448 --> 00:08:26,448
It's great.

167
00:08:26,448 --> 00:08:28,448
Look at the smell.

168
00:08:28,448 --> 00:08:30,448
Look.

169
00:08:30,448 --> 00:08:32,448
It's great.

170
00:08:32,448 --> 00:08:34,448
It smells good.

171
00:08:34,448 --> 00:08:36,448
It looks delicious.

172
00:08:36,448 --> 00:08:38,448
I'm happy.

173
00:08:38,448 --> 00:08:40,448
I'm happy.

174
00:08:40,448 --> 00:08:42,448
It's great.

175
00:08:42,448 --> 00:08:44,448
I'm happy.

176
00:08:44,448 --> 00:08:46,752
I'm happy.

177
00:08:46,752 --> 00:08:51,752
I was thinking that I would be happy if
I could eat a bento.

178
00:08:57,722 --> 00:09:00,722
Everyone is hiding in the dressing room.

179
00:09:01,722 --> 00:09:06,722
They are hiding when they are taking a
bath.

180
00:09:06,722 --> 00:09:08,722
They are looking at us, so they are
looking at us.

181
00:09:10,722 --> 00:09:12,722
When I asked her if it was delicious,
she said,

182
00:09:12,722 --> 00:09:14,722
I ate a bento.

183
00:09:14,722 --> 00:09:16,722
A fish bento.

184
00:09:16,722 --> 00:09:18,722
When I asked her if the meat was
delicious, she said,

185
00:09:18,722 --> 00:09:20,722
I ate a fish.

186
00:09:20,722 --> 00:09:22,722
I ate a fish.

187
00:09:22,722 --> 00:09:25,680
This is the final.

188
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:28,680
Let's eat beef tongue and finish it.

189
00:09:28,680 --> 00:09:31,680
It's like a BBQ for the last summer.

190
00:09:36,680 --> 00:09:37,680
Look at this.

191
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:39,680
I decorated it today.

192
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:40,680
Yes, today is the decoration.

193
00:09:40,680 --> 00:09:42,680
It's been a while.

194
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:45,680
I haven't seen it.

195
00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:48,680
I've done it many times when I went to
the festival.

196
00:09:48,680 --> 00:09:49,680
Dango.

197
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:50,680
Make it a dango.

198
00:09:50,680 --> 00:09:51,680
Not a dango.

199
00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:54,336
Today, I'm going to do my bangs.

200
00:09:54,336 --> 00:09:56,336
I've opened it.

201
00:09:56,336 --> 00:09:58,336
The way you wear it is different.

202
00:09:58,336 --> 00:10:00,336
Yes, it is.

203
00:10:00,336 --> 00:10:02,336
Thank you very much.

204
00:10:02,336 --> 00:10:04,336
Thank you very much.

205
00:10:04,336 --> 00:10:06,336
It's very thick.

206
00:10:08,336 --> 00:10:10,336
Is it spicy?

207
00:10:12,336 --> 00:10:14,336
Everyone, please eat.

208
00:10:14,336 --> 00:10:19,226
I did it.

209
00:10:19,226 --> 00:10:20,226
Yay!

210
00:10:20,226 --> 00:10:22,226
It's ready!

211
00:10:22,226 --> 00:10:24,226
It's warm!

212
00:10:24,226 --> 00:10:26,226
Thank you!

213
00:10:27,226 --> 00:10:29,226
Thank you!

214
00:10:29,226 --> 00:10:31,226
Let's eat!

215
00:10:31,226 --> 00:10:34,682
Thank you!

216
00:10:34,682 --> 00:10:36,682
It's so crunchy!

217
00:10:42,746 --> 00:10:44,746
It's so chewy!

218
00:10:44,746 --> 00:10:46,746
It's so chewy!

219
00:10:46,746 --> 00:10:48,746
It's so good!

220
00:10:50,746 --> 00:10:52,746
It's thick.

221
00:10:52,746 --> 00:10:54,746
It's thick, but it's chewy.

222
00:10:56,746 --> 00:10:58,746
It's so good!

223
00:11:00,746 --> 00:11:02,746
I'm so happy.

224
00:11:02,746 --> 00:11:16,154
It's so good!

225
00:11:16,154 --> 00:11:19,154
I want to eat in my room.

226
00:11:20,154 --> 00:11:22,154
Luxury!

227
00:11:23,154 --> 00:11:25,154
Oh, it's a low-point camera.

228
00:11:27,154 --> 00:11:30,154
I finished the first bowl of beef
tongue.

229
00:11:33,154 --> 00:11:38,154
I'm wondering when I'll go to the second
bowl of beef tongue.

230
00:11:39,154 --> 00:11:42,154
I already ate two bowls of tail soup.

231
00:11:42,154 --> 00:11:45,154
Today, I'm going to eat beef tongue for
the first time in a thousand years.

232
00:11:45,840 --> 00:11:47,840
I feel like I've eaten 牛 タン.

233
00:11:47,840 --> 00:11:49,840
Something came!

234
00:11:49,840 --> 00:11:54,840
I heard that you've finished 牛 タン 2 杯 目.

235
00:11:54,840 --> 00:11:56,840
I haven't finished 牛 タン yet.

236
00:11:56,840 --> 00:11:58,840
The tail soup is 牛 タン 2 杯 目.

237
00:11:58,840 --> 00:12:00,840
Oh, the tail soup.

238
00:12:00,840 --> 00:12:02,840
It's really delicious.

239
00:12:02,840 --> 00:12:04,840
What about 牛 タン 2 杯 目?

240
00:12:04,840 --> 00:12:07,840
I want to go, but I'm wondering when I
should go.

241
00:12:07,840 --> 00:12:09,840
When are you going?

242
00:12:09,840 --> 00:12:11,840
When are you going?

243
00:12:11,840 --> 00:12:13,840
I'm going to eat 牛 タン 2 杯 目.

244
00:12:13,840 --> 00:12:14,976
What?

245
00:12:14,976 --> 00:12:16,976
When is it?

246
00:12:16,976 --> 00:12:18,976
What is this devil's whisper?

247
00:12:18,976 --> 00:12:20,976
I want to eat it too.

248
00:12:20,976 --> 00:12:21,976
now?

249
00:12:21,976 --> 00:12:23,976
It may not be now, but before it goes
away.

250
00:12:23,976 --> 00:12:25,976
Let's go.

251
00:12:25,976 --> 00:12:27,976
It's really delicious.

252
00:12:27,976 --> 00:12:29,976
I was talking to Piyo today.

253
00:12:29,976 --> 00:12:31,976
It's Katamin today.

254
00:12:31,976 --> 00:12:33,976
Katamin?

255
00:12:33,976 --> 00:12:35,976
Katamin?

256
00:12:35,976 --> 00:12:37,976
Ah!

257
00:12:37,976 --> 00:12:39,976
What?

258
00:12:39,976 --> 00:12:42,976
You've met Sako-chan, haven't you?

259
00:12:42,976 --> 00:12:44,976
I don't know.

260
00:12:46,202 --> 00:12:48,202
Katamin

261
00:12:48,202 --> 00:12:50,202
I don't remember her name

262
00:12:50,202 --> 00:12:52,202
I met her in spring

263
00:12:52,202 --> 00:12:54,202
I didn't know that

264
00:12:54,202 --> 00:12:56,202
Today is Katamin

265
00:12:56,202 --> 00:12:58,202
I was talking about that

266
00:12:58,202 --> 00:13:00,202
I was wearing a skirt

267
00:13:00,202 --> 00:13:02,202
Only on the left side

268
00:13:02,202 --> 00:13:04,202
Katamin was in front of me

269
00:13:04,202 --> 00:13:06,202
and we were in the back

270
00:13:06,202 --> 00:13:08,202
Katamin was in front of me

271
00:13:08,202 --> 00:13:10,202
Katamin was in front of me

272
00:13:10,202 --> 00:13:12,202
I said it naturally

273
00:13:12,202 --> 00:13:14,202
I said it naturally

274
00:13:14,202 --> 00:13:16,202
I was like

275
00:13:16,202 --> 00:13:18,202
I was like

276
00:13:18,202 --> 00:13:19,898
I was like

277
00:13:19,898 --> 00:13:23,658
You definitely don't hit my head with
theChooni custume!

278
00:13:28,730 --> 00:13:30,730
I'm Kanamin.

279
00:13:32,730 --> 00:13:34,730
Don't get it wrong.

280
00:13:34,730 --> 00:13:44,090
Kanamin is Kanamin.

281
00:13:44,090 --> 00:13:46,090
Your eyes are so cute!

282
00:13:46,090 --> 00:13:48,090
So funny!

283
00:13:48,090 --> 00:13:53,090
Please look forward to when we'll go to
the second one!

284
00:13:53,090 --> 00:13:56,090
Please look forward to it! Bye bye!

285
00:13:56,090 --> 00:14:07,802
I'm done with my hair and makeup!

286
00:14:07,802 --> 00:14:09,802
I'm done!

287
00:14:09,802 --> 00:14:11,802
I'm going to drink the tail soup.

288
00:14:17,802 --> 00:14:19,802
I'm done with my make-up.

289
00:14:19,802 --> 00:14:23,802
I got my hair done for the second hour.

290
00:14:23,802 --> 00:14:25,802
It's actually really long.

291
00:14:25,802 --> 00:14:27,802
I'm going to make it a little bit
longer.

292
00:14:27,802 --> 00:14:31,802
I think this is the next hair style of
the new girl.

293
00:14:31,802 --> 00:14:36,802
I haven't made my bangs 100% firm yet.

294
00:14:37,392 --> 00:14:42,232
I went to the music room and Julia said
she was going to get some beef tongue.

295
00:14:42,232 --> 00:14:44,392
So I'm going to go get some.

296
00:14:44,392 --> 00:14:52,538
I'm going to get some beef tongue.

297
00:14:52,538 --> 00:14:54,538
I'm not done eating.

298
00:14:54,538 --> 00:14:55,538
It's good.

299
00:14:55,538 --> 00:14:56,538
It's so good.

300
00:14:56,538 --> 00:14:57,538
The meat is good.

301
00:14:57,538 --> 00:14:58,538
Can I eat it?

302
00:14:58,538 --> 00:15:00,538
I ate about 5 pieces.

303
00:15:03,538 --> 00:15:05,538
Thank you for the meal.

304
00:15:05,538 --> 00:15:11,546
Thank you for watching.

305
00:15:11,546 --> 00:15:15,006
2nd beef tongue.

306
00:15:15,006 --> 00:15:17,026
I'm going to big it up again, again.

307
00:15:21,026 --> 00:15:26,126
hebben NEVER SAID salty sirloin

308
00:15:26,126 --> 00:15:30,826
From now on, forever!

309
00:15:30,938 --> 00:15:32,938
There's beef tongue in the middle.

310
00:15:32,938 --> 00:15:34,938
There's no beef tongue in the tail soup.

311
00:15:34,938 --> 00:15:36,938
It's cold.

312
00:15:38,938 --> 00:15:40,938
Do you want to eat now?

313
00:15:40,938 --> 00:15:42,938
It's a rehearsal.

314
00:15:42,938 --> 00:15:44,938
I'll be scolded if I don't go to
rehearsal.

315
00:15:44,938 --> 00:15:46,938
It's a rehearsal.

316
00:15:46,938 --> 00:15:48,938
The rehearsal is over.

317
00:15:48,938 --> 00:15:50,938
Thank you for your hard work today.

318
00:15:50,938 --> 00:15:52,938
Thank you for your hard work today.

319
00:15:52,938 --> 00:15:55,584
Please look forward to it.

320
00:15:55,584 --> 00:16:02,584
We are Hatsune Miku TV, the group of 6
members of Hatsune Miku.

321
00:16:02,584 --> 00:16:04,584
Thank you for your cooperation.

322
00:16:04,584 --> 00:16:06,584
Thank you for your cooperation.

323
00:16:06,584 --> 00:16:35,584
Thank you for your cooperation.

324
00:16:36,410 --> 00:16:41,410
The first performance of the second half
of the year

325
00:16:43,410 --> 00:16:46,410
Everyone, please look forward to the
second half of the year!

326
00:16:46,410 --> 00:16:48,410
Please look forward to it!

327
00:16:48,410 --> 00:16:49,410
Thank you very much!

328
00:16:49,410 --> 00:16:52,410
Please look forward to it!

329
00:16:53,410 --> 00:16:55,410
I'm not done with my hair.

330
00:16:55,410 --> 00:16:58,512
Thank you very much!

331
00:16:58,512 --> 00:17:00,012
It's the final.

332
00:17:00,012 --> 00:17:02,012
Isn't it too early?

333
00:17:02,012 --> 00:17:04,012
The final of the tour.

334
00:17:04,012 --> 00:17:05,012
Oh my god!

335
00:17:05,012 --> 00:17:06,512
I ate a bite of mochi.

336
00:17:06,512 --> 00:17:08,012
Gat.

337
00:17:08,012 --> 00:17:09,012
Got?

338
00:17:09,012 --> 00:17:10,512
Got?

339
00:17:14,012 --> 00:17:15,012
Oh, it's good.

340
00:17:15,012 --> 00:17:17,012
It's good to have a good body.

341
00:17:17,012 --> 00:17:18,512
It's amazing.

342
00:17:18,512 --> 00:17:23,258
Thank you for watching.

343
00:17:23,258 --> 00:17:25,258
I love the moon on my chin.

344
00:17:26,258 --> 00:17:28,258
There's a moon on my chin!

345
00:17:28,258 --> 00:17:30,258
Oh my god!

346
00:17:31,258 --> 00:17:32,258
I'm so excited!

347
00:17:35,258 --> 00:17:36,258
What's this?

348
00:17:36,258 --> 00:17:37,258
Beef tongue.

349
00:17:39,258 --> 00:17:41,258
What's this?

350
00:17:41,258 --> 00:17:43,258
It's a beef tongue stick.

351
00:17:43,258 --> 00:17:44,258
It looks like a snack.

352
00:17:45,258 --> 00:17:47,258
It's a canned tuna.

353
00:17:48,258 --> 00:17:49,258
It looks good.

354
00:17:49,258 --> 00:17:50,258
There's also a cruller.

355
00:17:50,258 --> 00:17:53,258
I've never seen this before.

356
00:17:53,712 --> 00:17:55,712
I got mine.

357
00:17:57,712 --> 00:17:59,712
Look at this.

358
00:17:59,712 --> 00:18:01,712
It's amazing.

359
00:18:01,712 --> 00:18:03,712
It's neatly arranged.

360
00:18:04,712 --> 00:18:06,712
It's detailed.

361
00:18:07,712 --> 00:18:09,712
I want to eat mochi.

362
00:18:10,712 --> 00:18:11,712
I want to eat mochi.

363
00:18:11,712 --> 00:18:13,728
I love mochi.

364
00:18:13,728 --> 00:18:14,728
I love mochi.

365
00:18:14,728 --> 00:18:19,728
I can't eat tomorrow.

366
00:18:19,728 --> 00:18:21,728
I can't eat tomorrow.

367
00:18:21,728 --> 00:18:22,728
What do you want to eat tomorrow?

368
00:18:22,728 --> 00:18:24,728
I have a shooting tomorrow.

369
00:18:24,728 --> 00:18:26,728
I don't want to eat tomorrow.

370
00:18:26,728 --> 00:18:30,728
I'm talking about it, but it's the third
time I've had tail soup.

371
00:18:30,728 --> 00:18:32,728
I love mochi.

372
00:18:32,728 --> 00:18:35,450
I love mochi.

373
00:18:35,450 --> 00:18:37,450
It's called Sweet God.

374
00:18:37,450 --> 00:18:39,450
I see.

375
00:18:39,450 --> 00:18:41,450
Wow.

376
00:18:41,450 --> 00:18:45,450
Get, get, get, get, get, get.

377
00:18:45,450 --> 00:18:47,450
The pudding looks so good.

378
00:18:47,450 --> 00:18:49,450
I'll try it.

379
00:18:49,450 --> 00:18:52,450
It must be good.

380
00:18:54,450 --> 00:18:56,450
Wow.

381
00:18:56,450 --> 00:19:08,450
I'll eat a lot.

382
00:19:08,666 --> 00:19:13,666
I found a pineapple-flavored jelly!

383
00:19:16,666 --> 00:19:20,666
I shouldn't eat this here. I'll eat it
at the academy.

384
00:19:20,666 --> 00:19:22,666
There were a lot of cold jellies.

385
00:19:22,666 --> 00:19:27,666
I drank Zunda shake, ate beef tongue,
and drank tail soup.

386
00:19:27,666 --> 00:19:31,666
I'm enjoying Sendai.

387
00:19:31,666 --> 00:19:34,666
I brought a hair clip.

388
00:19:34,666 --> 00:19:36,666
What do you think?

389
00:19:36,666 --> 00:19:39,264
Something's wrong.

390
00:19:39,264 --> 00:19:41,264
I'll fix it later.

391
00:19:41,264 --> 00:19:43,264
This is coffee.

392
00:19:43,264 --> 00:19:45,264
Let's eat.

393
00:19:45,264 --> 00:19:59,834
It's a hotel.

394
00:19:59,834 --> 00:20:01,834
I'm so excited!

395
00:20:01,834 --> 00:20:05,834
Everyone, I'm not wearing any lipstick.

396
00:20:05,834 --> 00:20:10,970
So cute!

397
00:20:10,970 --> 00:20:14,970
I think this position is cute for Twin
Tail.

398
00:20:14,970 --> 00:20:15,970
Oh, it's a little long?

399
00:20:15,970 --> 00:20:16,970
Yes, it is.

400
00:20:16,970 --> 00:20:20,970
Certainly, if it's this roll, it's cute.

401
00:20:20,970 --> 00:20:22,970
This is cute.

402
00:20:22,970 --> 00:20:24,970
Let's do our best.

403
00:20:24,970 --> 00:20:26,970
It's the last one. It's the final.

404
00:20:26,970 --> 00:20:28,970
Is it the final?

405
00:20:28,970 --> 00:20:29,970
Yes.

406
00:20:29,970 --> 00:20:33,970
Aki-chan is decorating her hair.

407
00:20:33,970 --> 00:20:35,970
She is decorating part of her costume.

408
00:20:35,970 --> 00:20:37,970
This time, it's all.

409
00:20:37,970 --> 00:20:40,970
The ribbon of ankle and sleeve.

410
00:20:41,136 --> 00:20:42,136
I'm wearing it.

411
00:20:42,136 --> 00:20:44,136
Piyo-chan is done.

412
00:20:44,136 --> 00:20:45,136
Cute.

413
00:20:49,136 --> 00:20:50,136
It's the real thing.

414
00:20:51,136 --> 00:20:52,136
It's the real thing.

415
00:20:52,136 --> 00:20:53,136
I'm going.

00:20:53,136 --> 00:20:54,136
Let's go.

00:20:57,136 --> 00:20:58,136
Do you read it?

419
00:20:58,136 --> 00:20:59,136
Yes.

420
00:20:59,136 --> 00:21:03,136
I'm going to read it.

421
00:21:03,136 --> 00:21:04,136
The worst.

Aiming for the stars.

00:25:59,304 --> 00:26:02,304
Oh, I see. Aiming for the stars.

00:26:02,304 --> 00:26:04,304
The star has been banned.

00:26:04,304 --> 00:26:06,304
The star has been banned.

Wait a minute.

479
00:26:41,490 --> 00:26:43,490
We have a final today.

480
00:26:45,490 --> 00:26:48,490
Don't you want to get excited?

481
00:26:48,490 --> 00:26:50,490
Do you have the energy to get excited?

482
00:26:51,490 --> 00:26:52,490
Can you clap your hands?

We went to 6 places.

00:27:47,834 --> 00:27:49,834
We went to many places.

494
00:27:49,834 --> 00:27:53,834
This summer, we will be ranked as the
lowest in the range of travel in Japan.

495
00:27:53,834 --> 00:27:55,834
We will be ranked as the top.

496
00:27:55,834 --> 00:27:57,834
We went there and came back.

497
00:27:57,834 --> 00:27:59,834

Thank you for coming to see us.

502
00:28:14,792 --> 00:28:19,792
We were able to collaborate with many of
our friends from Sanrio.

503
00:28:19,792 --> 00:28:22,792
We were able to perform together.

504
00:28:22,792 --> 00:28:25,792
The space was so cute.

505
00:28:25,792 --> 00:28:28,792
Every time we performed, it was like a
healing place.

506
00:28:28,792 --> 00:28:30,792
It was fun from the beginning.

507
00:28:30,792 --> 00:28:33,792

The pavling is...

512
00:28:41,914 --> 00:28:43,914
Everyone is crouching down.

513
00:28:43,914 --> 00:28:45,914
The pavling is so cute.

514
00:28:45,914 --> 00:28:47,914
It's cute, isn't it?

515
00:28:47,914 --> 00:28:49,914

Bye bye.

528
00:29:36,698 --> 00:29:38,698
That's amazing!

529
00:29:38,698 --> 00:29:40,698
That's amazing!

530
00:29:40,698 --> 00:29:42,698

00:29:48,698 --> 00:29:57,696
My favorite Pick Me reuse!

535
00:29:57,696 --> 00:30:00,196
I hope to deliver this song to as many
people as possible.

536
00:30:00,196 --> 00:30:02,196
Through this MAKUHARI MESHIA,

537
00:30:02,196 --> 00:30:04,696
I want to make a step up to the next
level.

538
00:30:04,696 --> 00:30:08,196
I want to show a good performance so
that we won't lose to this company.

539
00:30:08,196 --> 00:30:12,196
I'm really looking forward to seeing the
smiles of the young people.

540
00:30:12,196 --> 00:30:16,196
I want to make a lot of memories and
memories.

541
00:30:16,196 --> 00:30:21,196
I think it would be fun if the six of us
could go to various places.

542
00:30:21,196 --> 00:30:23,196
On October 22nd,

543
00:30:23,196 --> 00:30:24,196

00:31:05,786 --> 00:31:07,786
I wonder why?

548
00:31:07,786 --> 00:31:13,786
When I smile, it's like the world is
shining

549
00:31:13,786 --> 00:31:17,786
I can relax by turning the umbrella

550
00:31:17,786 --> 00:31:21,786
Otherwise, I can't walk

551
00:31:21,786 --> 00:31:24,786
Someone is crying somewhere

552
00:31:24,786 --> 00:31:26,786
I'm getting wet again

553
00:31:26,786 --> 00:31:29,786
Isn't it cold?

554
00:31:29,786 --> 00:31:32,786
Someone is crying somewhere

555
00:31:32,786 --> 00:31:38,786
I want to share my feelings with you

556
00:31:38,786 --> 00:31:42,786
The scenery I don't know before my eyes

557
00:31:42,786 --> 00:31:48,506
Let's go anywhere

558
00:31:48,506 --> 00:31:50,506
Goodbye

559
00:31:50,950 --> 00:31:52,950
Thank you for yesterday

560
00:31:52,950 --> 00:31:56,950
The town after the rain is colored

561
00:31:56,950 --> 00:32:00,950
I was painting a fragment of the future
on the canvas of my heart

562
00:32:00,950 --> 00:32:24,950
I will guide you

563
00:32:24,986 --> 00:32:26,986
The reason why I sang

564
00:32:26,986 --> 00:32:30,986
When you get lost, remember it
immediately

565
00:32:30,986 --> 00:32:32,986
Even if it rains

566
00:32:32,986 --> 00:32:34,986
So that you can laugh

567
00:32:34,986 --> 00:32:38,138
Let's go anywhere

568
00:32:38,138 --> 00:32:40,138
Thank you for watching!

569
00:32:57,914 --> 00:33:02,914
Thank you for watching!

570
00:33:07,706 --> 00:33:10,906
I wear a rainbow dress
