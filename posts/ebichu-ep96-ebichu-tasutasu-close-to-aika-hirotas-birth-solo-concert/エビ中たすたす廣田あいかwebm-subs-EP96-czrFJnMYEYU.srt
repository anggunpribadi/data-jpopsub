00:00:00,762 --> 00:00:06,762
Tonight's Ebichu Tastasu is a special
Hirota Aika solo live!

2
00:00:06,762 --> 00:00:11,762
Hirota's first solo live was last month!

3
00:00:11,762 --> 00:00:18,762
The full-scale stage of Ai Ai World,
directed by Hirota himself!

4
00:00:18,762 --> 00:00:34,618
Ai Ai Tastasu, Start!

5
00:00:34,618 --> 00:00:36,618
I'm so into you that I can't stop

6
00:00:36,618 --> 00:00:41,618
What should I do with my heart?

7
00:00:42,618 --> 00:00:47,618
Monotrium, monotrium, monotrium, middle
school students

8
00:00:47,618 --> 00:00:51,618
Add various things to private Ebisu
middle school

9
00:00:52,618 --> 00:00:56,618
Ebisu Justice

10
00:00:56,618 --> 00:01:11,618
This program is brought to you by the
following sponsors.

11
00:01:12,090 --> 00:01:23,090
Hirota is preparing for the stage on the
morning of the live.

12
00:01:23,090 --> 00:01:25,090
What are you doing now?

13
00:01:25,090 --> 00:01:27,090
I'm exhibiting.

14
00:01:27,090 --> 00:01:29,090
I wanted to do this.

15
00:01:29,090 --> 00:01:33,090
What is the meaning of the commitment to
make it to the lobby?

16
00:01:33,090 --> 00:01:38,090
This time, I packed what I think is
cute.

17
00:01:38,090 --> 00:01:40,090
All of them are my exhibitions.

18
00:01:40,090 --> 00:01:44,090
The theme of the live is Aikawaii.

19
00:01:44,090 --> 00:01:49,090
It is a live with a lot of cute that
Hirota thinks.

20
00:01:49,090 --> 00:01:51,090
And this feeling.

21
00:01:51,090 --> 00:01:57,090
I couldn't do what I can do with my own
power.

22
00:01:57,090 --> 00:02:05,090
I feel like I made it by myself.

23
00:02:05,090 --> 00:02:11,090
So, I asked the designer who admires
Hirota to make it.

24
00:02:11,090 --> 00:02:15,090
I wrapped myself in a special costume
and went to the rehearsal.

25
00:02:15,090 --> 00:02:17,090
Then.

26
00:02:17,090 --> 00:02:20,122
What are you doing now?

27
00:02:20,122 --> 00:02:22,122
愀 definitely very big.

28
00:02:24,416 --> 00:02:28,416
I've been wanting to do a live
performance since I was a kid.

29
00:02:28,416 --> 00:02:33,416
I finally got to do it this time.

30
00:02:33,416 --> 00:02:34,416
I'm so happy.

31
00:02:34,416 --> 00:02:41,416
I only asked her to do it.

32
00:02:41,416 --> 00:02:43,416
I was hoping for it.

33
00:02:43,416 --> 00:02:48,416
I'm so happy to cast her.

34
00:02:48,416 --> 00:02:51,416
I'm so happy.

35
00:02:51,416 --> 00:02:55,416
She's perfect for the role of a panda.

36
00:02:55,416 --> 00:02:58,416
She's also very particular about the
song selection.

37
00:02:58,416 --> 00:03:05,416
I wanted to make a song that would make
everyone confused.

38
00:03:05,416 --> 00:03:08,416
I'm going to make it a setlist.

39
00:03:08,416 --> 00:03:12,416
I'm going to have a lot of fun.

40
00:03:12,416 --> 00:03:16,464
I hope you'll be excited.

41
00:03:17,464 --> 00:03:18,464
Where are we?

42
00:03:18,464 --> 00:03:20,464
Aizawa!

43
00:03:20,464 --> 00:03:21,464
Ai Ai...

44
00:03:21,464 --> 00:03:27,162

45
00:03:27,162 --> 00:03:31,162
Finally, the special live that Hirota is
going to send

46
00:03:40,314 --> 00:03:42,314

00:03:43,110 --> 00:03:45,110
I'm going to make it!

48
00:03:47,110 --> 00:03:48,110

Please, go to sleep soon

Five more minutes, ten more minutes

67
00:04:42,834 --> 00:04:45,534
I don't have time anymore

68
00:04:46,034 --> 00:04:50,534
Ah, I'm an idol

69
00:04:50,534 --> 00:04:53,034

79
00:06:12,506 --> 00:06:15,086
If you debut solo, release a CD,

80
00:06:15,086 --> 00:06:17,706
you'll get 800,000 yen in profit.

81
00:06:17,706 --> 00:06:18,506
Yeah.

82
00:06:18,506 --> 00:06:21,086
800,000 yen is yours.

83
00:06:21,086 --> 00:06:23,466
But if it's a four-member band,

84
00:06:23,466 --> 00:06:24,426
you'll get a quarter.

85
00:06:24,426 --> 00:06:25,766
That's not all.

86
00:06:25,766 --> 00:06:29,426
The sales, the appearance, the karaoke,

87
00:06:29,426 --> 00:06:32,266
the music, everything is yours.

88
00:06:32,266 --> 00:06:34,026
But if it's a four-member band,

89
00:06:34,026 --> 00:06:35,226
you'll get a quarter.

90
00:06:35,226 --> 00:06:37,646
What? The band is a joke, right?

91
00:06:37,646 --> 00:06:40,526
Yeah! The band is a joke!

92
00:06:40,526 --> 00:06:52,366
The band is a joke!

93
00:06:55,080 --> 00:06:57,080
We are one

94
00:06:57,080 --> 00:07:00,080
And we are two

95
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:03,080
Hey, hey, that's a promise you don't
say!

96
00:07:03,080 --> 00:07:06,080
No, it's a promise you don't say!

97
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:11,194
Once this song is over, it's just the
usual Pou-chan!

98
00:07:11,194 --> 00:07:14,194
We're friends, friends, friends

I'm counting on you

105

Okay, let's do just one song

106
00:07:29,194 --> 00:07:30,194
Really?

I want to drink more, Mama

112
00:08:10,154 --> 00:08:15,154
You really are a useless person

113
00:08:15,154 --> 00:08:19,154
I hate you, my tears are running down my
face

114
00:08:19,154 --> 00:08:22,154
Are you crying?

115
00:08:22,154 --> 00:08:25,154
I just got a little drunk

116
00:08:25,154 --> 00:08:31,154
The two of us are in the middle of the
night

117
00:08:31,154 --> 00:08:36,154
This is Uguizuna

118
00:08:36,154 --> 00:08:41,154
A small snack for the party

119
00:08:41,154 --> 00:08:46,154
Fried rice, mixed fried

120
00:08:46,154 --> 00:08:51,154
We're having a handmade lunch

121
00:08:51,154 --> 00:08:55,154
I'm really sorry about everything

122
00:08:55,154 --> 00:08:57,154
What did you just say?

123
00:08:57,154 --> 00:09:00,154
Nothing, I'm going home

124
00:09:00,154 --> 00:09:03,154
Be careful, I'll be waiting for you
tomorrow

125

This is the last time

126
00:09:06,928 --> 00:09:08,588
You... What's wrong?

127
00:09:08,588 --> 00:09:10,268
Don't tell me... You...

What's going on?

Even if loneliness teaches me the way to
sadness

184
00:15:41,442 --> 00:15:52,442
I'm still breathing, I'm still alive
today

186
00:16:13,594 --> 00:16:26,594
May it be a blessing to me, the only one
in the world

187
00:16:26,594 --> 00:16:33,594
May it be a blessing to my tears

188
00:16:33,594 --> 00:16:40,272
May it be a blessing to tomorrow

189
00:16:40,272 --> 00:16:48,272
Become the one shining light in the
world

190
00:16:48,272 --> 00:16:54,272
It's okay to cry, just walk towards me

191
00:16:54,272 --> 00:17:01,272
Tears are like a shooting star

192
00:17:01,272 --> 00:17:05,272
Come, be mine, make me come true

193
00:17:05,272 --> 00:17:10,272
And live on

194
00:17:10,272 --> 00:17:17,272
Oh, always

195
00:17:23,408 --> 00:17:31,408
Oh, always

196
00:17:53,408 --> 00:17:54,554
Thank you for watching!

Hank Gordon! Hank Gordon!

199
00:18:31,386 --> 00:18:33,386
Yes!

200
00:18:33,386 --> 00:18:35,386
Thank you for the encore!

201
00:18:35,386 --> 00:18:37,386
More importantly,

202
00:18:37,386 --> 00:18:39,386
today,

203
00:18:39,386 --> 00:18:43,386
thank you for coming to Aikawai!

204
00:18:47,386 --> 00:18:49,386
Wow!

205
00:18:49,386 --> 00:18:51,386
I prepared a song

206
00:18:51,386 --> 00:18:56,698
for you.

207
00:18:56,698 --> 00:19:08,198
When I was about 10 years old, I was
auditioning to join the agency.

208
00:19:08,198 --> 00:19:14,864
I had voted for this song for the
audition in my car,

209
00:19:14,864 --> 00:19:21,864
but I happened to have the song I voted
for for the audition when I was 10 years
old.

210
00:19:21,864 --> 00:19:27,864
So it's a little embarrassing, but I can
only do it on this occasion.

211
00:19:27,864 --> 00:19:38,960
I hope I can sing with the me of 10
years old and the me of 18 years old.

212
00:19:38,960 --> 00:19:44,960
With her singing voice before her debut,
she showed us a song of memories.

213
00:20:08,256 --> 00:20:19,256
Embrace the miracle reflected in those
eyes

214
00:20:30,554 --> 00:20:34,554
I can't be honest

215
00:20:34,554 --> 00:20:40,554
I've been going around in circles

216
00:20:40,554 --> 00:20:49,554
I don't know the real meaning of dreams
and fangs

217
00:20:49,554 --> 00:20:59,482
I think it's magic to be a wonderful me

218
00:20:59,482 --> 00:21:09,482
I don't need to cry and laugh

219
00:21:09,482 --> 00:21:18,482
I only need you, I love you

220
00:21:18,482 --> 00:21:23,482
I'm with you, with you, I'm with you, in
your side

221
00:21:23,482 --> 00:21:29,482
So you can fly high

222
00:21:30,824 --> 00:21:39,824
You, who looks like you don't want to
lose

223
00:21:39,824 --> 00:21:49,824
Are getting closer to your dream than
anyone else

224
00:21:49,824 --> 00:21:59,664
I want to spread my wings that only you
can do

225
00:21:59,664 --> 00:22:10,664
Embrace the miracle reflected in those
eyes

226
00:22:17,094 --> 00:22:26,174
It's so beautiful, like a dream

227
00:22:47,094 --> 00:22:47,194
Thank you for watching!

228
00:22:47,194 --> 00:22:49,614
Thank you so much.

229
00:22:49,634 --> 00:22:50,154
Yep!

230
00:22:50,154 --> 00:22:55,154
How was Aikawari today?

231
00:22:57,328 --> 00:23:04,328
I thought it was really cute when I
first thought of it.

232
00:23:04,328 --> 00:23:14,328
I think it was the first time I've ever
thought of something in my mind and in
my head.

233
00:23:14,328 --> 00:23:16,328
I'm afraid of it.

234
00:23:16,328 --> 00:23:22,328
I'm often told that I'm different.

235
00:23:22,328 --> 00:23:30,328
But I think there are definitely many
people who find it hard to say that they
like me.

236
00:23:30,328 --> 00:23:41,328
I want to be able to say that I'm
supporting this girl to my precious
person.

237
00:23:41,328 --> 00:23:52,328
Thank you for your continued support.

238
00:23:55,290 --> 00:24:01,290
Hiroto's first solo concert was a
success.

239
00:24:02,290 --> 00:24:04,290
Thank you very much.

240
00:24:05,290 --> 00:24:07,290
Thank you very much.

241
00:24:08,290 --> 00:24:10,290
I really enjoyed it.

242
00:24:10,290 --> 00:24:15,696
I really wanted to do it.

243
00:24:16,696 --> 00:24:20,696
I'm really happy that I could do
everything I wanted to do.

244
00:24:21,696 --> 00:24:27,696
I want to do my best to make more
opportunities like this.

245
00:24:27,696 --> 00:24:33,984
Thank you very much.

246

Welcome

249
00:24:41,984 --> 00:24:42,984
Good morning

250
00:24:43,984 --> 00:24:45,984
I'm here to shoot

251
00:24:46,984 --> 00:24:47,984
Why?

Open Ramen Mayama

253
00:24:50,984 --> 00:24:53,984
And the person who missed Ebichu Tastas

254
00:24:54,984 --> 00:24:57,984
On the star dust channel, a low-cost
video distribution site

255
00:24:57,984 --> 00:24:59,984
Ebichu Tastas is popular

256
00:24:59,984 --> 00:25:03,984
I'm a famous person over there

257
00:25:03,984 --> 00:25:04,984
Don't laugh

258
00:25:04,984 --> 00:25:10,984
Ebichu Tastas is available for 400 yen
per month

259

In addition, a large number of
unreleased special footage will be
released.

260
00:25:15,968 --> 00:25:17,968
