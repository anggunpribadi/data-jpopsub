00:00.000 --> 00:02.000
 To be continued

00:02.000 --> 00:04.000
 Good morning

00:04.000 --> 00:06.000
 Thank you

00:07.072 --> 00:11.572
 I'm going to explain the plan, but I'm
going to explain it.

00:11.572 --> 00:16.572
 Today, I'm going to ask your parents to
do a little questionnaire.

00:16.572 --> 00:19.072
 I took it.

00:19.072 --> 00:23.072
 I want you to put on a mosaic.

00:23.072 --> 00:26.572
 I asked you to take 16 questions.

00:26.572 --> 00:30.572
 I'm sure I should tell you this.

00:30.572 --> 00:34.572
 No!

00:34.572 --> 00:38.572
 I've made a quiz.

00:38.572 --> 00:43.572
 First, I'll tell you what I asked my
parents.

00:43.572 --> 00:48.572
 I'll read one of the three parents.

00:48.572 --> 00:52.572
 Please guess who the parent is.

00:52.572 --> 00:56.572
 I don't know what I asked.

00:56.572 --> 01:00.572
 If my parents give me a question, I'll
be covered in seaweed.

01:00.572 --> 01:03.572
 I can't give up.

01:03.572 --> 01:06.572
 Don't look at me.

01:06.572 --> 01:09.572
 I thought you were going to look at me.

01:09.572 --> 01:14.572
 I'm going to explain the first
question.

01:14.572 --> 01:19.572
 I'll tell you what I like about my
daughter.

01:19.572 --> 01:22.572
 I'm embarrassed.

01:22.572 --> 01:26.572
 I think it's a bad idea to read it with
emotions.

01:26.572 --> 01:29.572
 I'll read it in a loud voice.

01:29.572 --> 01:33.572
 I'm embarrassed. I'm shy.

01:33.572 --> 01:35.572
 Please forgive me.

01:35.572 --> 01:38.572
 Thank you for being my daughter.

01:38.572 --> 01:40.572
 Who is it?

01:40.572 --> 01:42.572
 All of them.

01:42.572 --> 01:45.572
 The answer is one of the three.

01:45.572 --> 01:47.572
 It's Ayako Tonodama.

01:47.572 --> 01:49.572
 It depends on who wrote it.

01:49.572 --> 01:52.572
 Maybe my mom.

01:52.572 --> 01:54.572
 But my mom is not shy.

01:54.572 --> 01:56.572
 What?

01:56.572 --> 01:59.572
 My dad.

01:59.572 --> 02:01.572
 I'm not shy.

02:01.572 --> 02:04.572
 I'm a girl.

02:04.572 --> 02:08.572
 I'm a girl who does a lot of things.

02:08.572 --> 02:12.572
 I'm a girl who wears afro at a wedding.

02:12.572 --> 02:14.572
 I've decided.

02:14.572 --> 02:17.572
 Please read the question.

02:17.572 --> 02:19.572
 Rime's mom.

02:19.572 --> 02:22.572
 Rune.

02:22.572 --> 02:25.572
 The answer is Rime.

02:25.572 --> 02:26.480
 I'm embarrassed.

02:30.344 --> 02:32.344
 Is it your dad?

02:32.344 --> 02:34.344
 I like everything about you.

02:36.344 --> 02:38.344
 Don't go home.

02:39.344 --> 02:41.344
 I'm moved.

02:41.344 --> 02:43.344
 I'm watching you.

02:47.344 --> 02:50.344
 Don't write good things at this time.

02:50.344 --> 02:52.344
 I like everything about you.

02:52.344 --> 02:54.344
 The second question.

02:54.344 --> 02:58.344
 Tell me your daughter's childhood
habits.

02:58.344 --> 03:00.344
 I don't have any.

03:00.344 --> 03:03.344
 There are three answers.

03:03.344 --> 03:07.344
 1. Standing on a papaya or a bed.

03:08.968 --> 03:10.968
 2. Dancing at a supermarket or a
convenience store.

03:13.968 --> 03:15.968
 3. Ranking everything.

03:18.968 --> 03:21.968
 I don't have the desire to rank
anything.

03:21.968 --> 03:22.968
 No.

03:22.968 --> 03:23.968
 Do you?

03:23.968 --> 03:24.968
 No.

03:26.968 --> 03:28.968
 Let's go with this.

03:29.968 --> 03:30.968
 RUN-chan!

03:30.968 --> 03:31.968
 YUNA!

03:31.968 --> 03:33.248
 Thank you for watching!

03:41.184 --> 03:43.184
 I think it's a little different.

03:43.184 --> 03:45.184
 The correct answer is Mitsuki.

03:45.184 --> 03:47.184
 What?

03:47.184 --> 03:49.184
 Were you walking while dancing?

03:49.184 --> 03:51.184
 I think so.

03:51.184 --> 03:53.184
 I was walking on a roller skate.

03:53.184 --> 03:55.184
 I remember that.

03:55.184 --> 03:57.184
 Did you wear a shoe lace?

03:57.184 --> 03:59.184
 Yes.

03:59.184 --> 04:01.184
 I thought it was a shoe lace.

04:01.184 --> 04:03.184
 I like to slip and hit people.

04:05.184 --> 04:07.184
 You are a mischievous girl.

04:07.184 --> 04:09.184
 The third question.

04:09.184 --> 04:13.184
 What is the most angry thing you have
ever done to your daughter?

04:15.184 --> 04:19.184
 The answer is that I don't remember
what I was angry about.

04:21.184 --> 04:23.184
 Why?

04:23.184 --> 04:25.184
 I don't remember.

04:25.184 --> 04:27.184
 I don't remember at all.

04:27.184 --> 04:29.184
 I remember the most angry thing I've
ever done.

04:29.184 --> 04:31.184
 Are you ready?

04:31.184 --> 04:33.184
 Please answer.

04:33.216 --> 04:34.016
 Rina

04:34.016 --> 04:34.916
 Rin-chan

04:34.916 --> 04:35.716
 Rin-chan

04:36.716 --> 04:37.816
 The answer is

04:37.816 --> 04:38.516
 Nishiki-san

04:38.516 --> 04:39.516
 Ah

04:39.516 --> 04:40.716
 See?

04:40.716 --> 04:42.016
 Which one is the best?

04:42.016 --> 04:43.116
 I don't remember the other one

04:43.116 --> 04:44.616
 Which one is the best?

04:44.616 --> 04:46.416
 Then, the next question

04:46.416 --> 04:50.116
 Q. What did you do when your daughter
got angry at you?

04:50.116 --> 04:51.516
 Eh?

04:51.516 --> 04:52.416
 The answer is

04:52.416 --> 04:56.716
 Q. If you put a small box of chocolate
in the room,

04:56.716 --> 05:00.016
 Q. the number of people who can't come
will increase, so don't meet anymore

05:00.016 --> 05:00.516
 Ah

05:00.516 --> 05:01.116
 Don't say it

05:01.116 --> 05:03.016
 Don't say it

05:03.016 --> 05:04.216
 Don't say it

05:04.216 --> 05:04.816
 Ah

05:04.816 --> 05:06.016
 Ah

05:06.016 --> 05:07.016
 Don't say it

05:07.016 --> 05:07.816
 I

05:07.816 --> 05:08.316
 Don't say it

05:08.316 --> 05:08.916
 I

05:08.916 --> 05:10.016
 I'm the best

05:10.016 --> 05:10.716
 You are the best

05:10.716 --> 05:11.616
 Ah

05:11.616 --> 05:12.116
 I'm angry

05:12.116 --> 05:13.016
 What is this?

05:13.016 --> 05:17.116
 I have a seat for the person in charge,
but I have to take a ticket in public

05:17.116 --> 05:20.616
 I might get hit by someone else, but

05:20.616 --> 05:22.616
 I said it about 5 times

05:22.616 --> 05:24.116
 Then, the fifth question

05:24.116 --> 05:29.416
 Q. What color do you think your
daughter is if she is not a member color
now?

05:29.416 --> 05:30.216

 Q. Please tell me the reason

05:32.316 --> 05:33.216

05:36.016 --> 05:39.516
 Q. She used to look good in blue
clothes when she was a child

05:39.516 --> 05:40.316
 Eh?

05:40.316 --> 05:41.916
 Isn't it Yuna?

05:41.916 --> 05:42.416
 Ah

05:42.416 --> 05:43.416
 It's different

05:43.416 --> 05:44.216
 It's true, it's Rie

05:44.216 --> 05:46.016
 It's Rie in the elimination method

05:46.016 --> 05:47.216
 It's Rie

05:47.216 --> 05:47.816
 The correct answer is

05:47.816 --> 05:50.116
 Q. Black

05:50.116 --> 05:51.916
 I like black

05:51.916 --> 05:53.716
 She looked good in blue clothes

05:53.716 --> 05:54.716
 It's a good match

05:54.716 --> 05:55.616
 That's right

05:55.616 --> 05:58.016
 It will be purple

05:58.016 --> 05:59.316
 The sixth question

05:59.316 --> 06:04.916

 Ah

06:11.416 --> 06:14.916
 Q. There is a reason for this

06:14.916 --> 06:24.916
 Q. When she entered this world, she was
told that her name was not Izumi Pink,
and her family believed it

06:24.916 --> 06:25.916
 Who?

06:25.916 --> 06:27.716
 Ah

06:27.716 --> 06:30.816
 It's so funny

06:30.816 --> 06:32.316

 Ah

06:34.116 --> 06:35.716

06:38.616 --> 06:40.116
 Izumi Pink

06:40.116 --> 06:41.616
 It's so funny

06:41.616 --> 06:43.016
 I just understood

06:43.016 --> 06:44.816
 I was really going to do it

06:44.816 --> 06:48.116
 I want to be Izumi Pink

06:48.116 --> 06:49.216
 I'm serious

06:49.216 --> 06:52.816
 I'm laughing, but I'm serious

06:52.816 --> 06:56.216
 You have a good sense

06:56.216 --> 06:58.216
 I gave up

06:58.216 --> 07:02.616

 I would like you to consider again

07:33.440 --> 07:36.440
 Please tell me the reason why you want
to get married.

07:36.440 --> 07:38.440
 I've never heard of it.

07:38.440 --> 07:39.440
 I have.

07:39.440 --> 07:41.440
 I have a good reason.

07:41.440 --> 07:45.440
 The answer is to protect your
daughter's smile.

07:45.440 --> 07:46.440
 That's great.

07:46.440 --> 07:47.440
 That's great.

07:47.440 --> 07:48.440
 That's too great.

07:48.440 --> 07:51.440
 Great and tolerant person.

07:51.440 --> 07:53.440
 A person who can't change even to his
parents.

07:53.440 --> 07:58.440
 A person who can change anything loose
with the power of love.

07:58.440 --> 08:00.440
 That's great.

08:00.440 --> 08:03.440
 Did you answer three questions?

08:03.440 --> 08:05.440
 I answered three questions.

08:05.440 --> 08:07.440
 I understood.

08:07.440 --> 08:08.440
 I understood.

08:08.440 --> 08:09.440
 I'll start with YUNA.

08:09.440 --> 08:12.440
 RUN-CHAN

08:12.440 --> 08:13.440
 That's right.

08:13.440 --> 08:14.440
 That's great.

08:14.440 --> 08:16.440
 That's great.

08:16.440 --> 08:18.440
 A person who can't change even to his
parents.

08:18.440 --> 08:20.440
 A person who can't change anything
loose with the power of love.

08:20.440 --> 08:23.440
 That's great.

08:23.440 --> 08:24.440
 Question 9.

08:24.440 --> 08:28.440
 Please tell me the first impression
when your daughter was born.

08:28.440 --> 08:31.440
 YUNA is a girl.

08:33.440 --> 08:37.440
 But YUNA is a boy.

08:37.440 --> 08:43.440
 But YUNA is the first child.

08:43.440 --> 08:46.440
 I think YUNA is a girl.

08:46.440 --> 08:48.440
 I'll tell you my impression.

08:50.440 --> 08:51.440
 YUNA is a boy.

08:51.440 --> 08:53.440
 RINNE

08:53.440 --> 08:55.440
 The answer is RUN-CHAN.

08:55.440 --> 08:57.440
 That's great.

08:57.440 --> 08:59.440
 I thought RINNE was a girl.

08:59.440 --> 09:01.440
 I thought RINNE was a boy.

09:01.440 --> 09:02.440
 Is that so?

09:02.440 --> 09:04.440
 I thought RINNE was a boy.

09:04.440 --> 09:06.440
 That's why RINNE is a girl.

09:06.440 --> 09:09.440
 I didn't think so.

09:09.440 --> 09:10.440
 Question 10.

09:10.440 --> 09:14.440
 Please tell me the impressive episode
when you were a child.

09:14.440 --> 09:15.440
 The answer is

09:15.440 --> 09:19.440
 When I went to buy a nanoseal, I
recommended a red one.

09:19.440 --> 09:27.440
 But I was told that I didn't want to
buy it.

09:27.440 --> 09:30.440
 I said, If you want a red one so much,
you should buy it.

09:30.440 --> 09:33.440
 I said, I'm sure this is good.

09:33.440 --> 09:36.440
 I said, I'm sure this is good.

09:37.440 --> 09:38.440
 That's great.

09:38.440 --> 09:40.440
 I don't want to buy a cat-shaped one.

09:40.440 --> 09:42.440
 But it's easy to understand.

09:42.440 --> 09:44.440
 I got it.

09:44.440 --> 09:46.440
 The answer is RUN-CHAN.

09:46.440 --> 09:47.440
 I got it.

09:47.440 --> 09:50.440
 RUN-CHAN is a cat-shaped one.

09:50.440 --> 09:52.440
 I can't recommend it.

09:52.440 --> 09:55.440
 I thought it was good to buy a red one.

09:55.440 --> 09:57.440
 I thought it was good to buy a red one.

09:57.440 --> 09:59.440
 I thought it was good to buy a red one.

10:00.440 --> 10:01.440
 Question 11.

10:01.440 --> 10:08.440
 What is the correct answer if you give
a cat-shaped coffee to your daughter?

10:08.440 --> 10:09.440
 That's interesting.

10:09.440 --> 10:11.440
 I'll give you a hint.

10:11.440 --> 10:12.440
 What is it?

10:12.440 --> 10:13.440
 The answer is

10:13.440 --> 10:15.440
 Pon pon pan pan, robo pan pan.

10:15.440 --> 10:17.440
 What?

10:18.440 --> 10:20.440
 I got it.

10:20.440 --> 10:22.440
 That's great.

10:22.440 --> 10:24.440
 I'm sure it's YUNA.

10:24.440 --> 10:26.440
 I'll give you a hint.

10:28.440 --> 10:30.440
 What is the correct answer?

10:30.440 --> 10:31.440
 The answer is

10:31.440 --> 10:32.440
 PANZUKI.

10:32.440 --> 10:34.440
 It's POKU PANPAN.

10:35.440 --> 10:37.440
 That's too random.

10:37.440 --> 10:39.440
 POKU PANPAN, POKU PANPAN.

10:39.440 --> 10:41.440
 I like KOTAKU.

10:41.440 --> 10:43.440
 Question 12.

10:43.440 --> 10:47.440
 What are the hidden special skills of
KOTONE?

10:47.440 --> 10:49.440
 There are two.

10:49.440 --> 10:53.440
 The first one is eating chicken wings.

10:53.440 --> 10:57.440
 The second one is saying what she ate
on Saturday.

10:59.440 --> 11:01.440
 I can't answer that.

11:01.440 --> 11:02.440
 I got it.

11:02.440 --> 11:03.440
 I got it by the wings.

11:03.440 --> 11:04.440
 RUN-CHAN.

11:04.440 --> 11:05.440
 I also think RUN-CHAN.

11:05.440 --> 11:06.440
 RUN-CHAN?

11:06.440 --> 11:07.440
 That's correct.

11:08.440 --> 11:10.440
 She eats cleanly.

11:10.440 --> 11:13.440
 Can you say what you ate on Wednesday?

11:15.440 --> 11:16.440
 I don't know what special skill is.

11:16.440 --> 11:19.440
 I ate an apple.

11:20.440 --> 11:22.440
 She doesn't say anything.

11:23.440 --> 11:25.440
 I'll check it again.

11:26.440 --> 11:30.440
 Q. Please tell me what you were happy
to have your daughter.

11:31.440 --> 11:32.440
 Cooking

11:34.440 --> 11:35.440
 Cooking?

11:36.440 --> 11:37.440
 Rine.

11:38.440 --> 11:39.440
 That's all?

11:40.440 --> 11:42.440
 Rine's parents are funny.

11:44.440 --> 11:47.440
 You don't answer.

11:47.440 --> 11:49.440
 Rui's answer is correct.

11:50.440 --> 11:51.440
 I think so.

11:52.440 --> 11:53.440
 I can understand.

11:54.440 --> 11:55.440
 The way of writing is different.

11:56.440 --> 12:01.440
 Rui's writing is long and Rui's writing
is short.

12:02.440 --> 12:03.440
 It's written in words.

12:03.440 --> 12:07.034
 Please subscribe to this channel.

12:07.034 --> 12:10.034
 I'm

12:10.034 --> 12:13.034
 not

12:13.034 --> 12:15.034
 sure.

12:15.034 --> 12:18.034
 I don't know.

12:18.034 --> 12:20.034
 I'm

12:20.034 --> 12:22.034
 not

12:22.034 --> 12:25.034
 sure.

12:25.034 --> 12:27.034
 I'm

12:27.034 --> 12:29.034
 not

12:29.034 --> 12:31.034
 sure.

12:31.034 --> 12:33.034
 I'm not sure.

12:33.034 --> 12:35.034
 I'm not sure.

12:35.034 --> 12:36.034
 I'm not sure.

12:37.034 --> 12:38.034
 I'm not sure.

12:43.034 --> 12:44.034
 I'm not sure.

12:44.034 --> 12:46.034
 I'm not sure.

12:46.034 --> 12:47.034
 I'm not sure.

12:50.034 --> 12:52.034
 Let's talk about the second question.

12:52.034 --> 12:54.034
 Please tell us if you have something
impressive

12:54.034 --> 12:57.034
 about the present from your daughter.

12:57.034 --> 12:59.888
 This is a letter I got from the nursery
school.

13:00.888 --> 13:02.888
 I think everyone is raising their
hands.

13:04.888 --> 13:06.888
 I think this is like RINNE.

13:06.888 --> 13:08.888
 I think so, too.

13:08.888 --> 13:10.888
 Is it RINNE?

13:10.888 --> 13:12.888
 The answer is Ritsuki.

13:12.888 --> 13:17.104
 What? Maybe it's a language teacher.

13:18.104 --> 13:19.104
 I'm not sure.

13:20.104 --> 13:21.104
 I asked one more question.

13:22.104 --> 13:25.104
 Do you have any secret to your
daughter? If so, please tell us.

13:26.104 --> 13:27.104
 I think there are many secrets.

13:28.104 --> 13:29.104
 The answer is,

13:29.104 --> 13:32.104
 I have a dress that doesn't fit her,

13:32.104 --> 13:37.104
 so I put it in a closet where she
doesn't see it.

13:38.104 --> 13:39.104
 What does that mean?

13:39.104 --> 13:46.104
 For example, I hid the dress that Rine
is wearing because I thought it wasn't
cute.

13:47.104 --> 13:48.104
 Rine doesn't see it.

13:49.104 --> 13:50.104
 I'm scared.

13:51.104 --> 13:54.104
 I put a hot wire on her crotch, so I
don't think she threw it away.

13:55.104 --> 13:56.104
 I see.

13:57.104 --> 13:58.104
 I think I know the answer.

13:59.104 --> 14:00.104
 Rune.

14:00.104 --> 14:01.104
 Rune.

14:02.104 --> 14:03.104
 The answer is,

14:03.104 --> 14:03.152
 I have a dress that doesn't fit her,

14:04.152 --> 14:05.152
 Kitana.

14:06.152 --> 14:08.152
 Rine, you lost one of your clothes.

14:09.152 --> 14:10.152
 I don't like to wear clothes that don't
fit me.

14:11.152 --> 14:13.152
 You don't remember which clothes you
lost?

14:14.152 --> 14:15.152
 It's funny.

14:16.152 --> 14:18.152
 You are hiding it so that I can't wear
it.

14:22.152 --> 14:23.152
 You are hiding it.

14:24.152 --> 14:25.152
 You are hiding it so that I can't wear
it.

14:26.152 --> 14:28.152
 I thought you would get angry.

14:28.152 --> 14:30.152
 I'm sorry.

14:31.152 --> 14:32.152
 That's all for today.

14:33.152 --> 14:36.152
 You probably don't remember which
clothes you lost.

14:36.152 --> 14:37.744
 Please subscribe to our channel.

14:38.744 --> 14:41.744
 We will see how you guys react to this.

14:41.744 --> 14:43.744
 How we react?

14:44.744 --> 14:46.744
 We will see how you guys react to this.

14:47.744 --> 14:51.744
 We will see how you guys react to this.

14:51.744 --> 14:52.744
 It was fun.

14:52.744 --> 14:54.744
 We all wanted to do this.

14:54.744 --> 14:57.744
 I thought we would get bad comments.

14:57.744 --> 15:00.744
 I was so moved at the beginning.

15:00.744 --> 15:01.744
 I agree.

15:01.744 --> 15:03.744
 We haven't read the comments yet.

15:03.744 --> 15:04.744
 We will see.

15:04.744 --> 15:07.744
 That's all for today.

15:07.744 --> 15:10.744
 Thank you for watching.

15:10.744 --> 15:14.744
 We will be more supportive of our
parents.

15:14.744 --> 15:18.744
 Please take care of your parents and
children.

15:18.744 --> 15:25.744
 Bye bye.

15:25.920 --> 15:35.381
 Thank you for watching.
