00:00.000 --> 00:10.000
 In conclusion, I'd like to see
Tachikawa perform this time.

00:10.000 --> 00:15.000
 Tachikawa's performance at the Tokyo
Dome

00:17.000 --> 00:22.000
 Tachikawa's performance at the Tokyo
Dome

00:22.000 --> 00:27.000
 What did you think of Tachikawa's
performance?

00:27.000 --> 00:30.000
 To be honest...

00:30.048 --> 00:36.688
 I've never been able to perform for so
long, so I was really worried.

00:36.688 --> 00:39.688
 When I first imagined what I wanted to
do,

00:39.688 --> 00:44.128
 the first thing that came to my mind
was performing.

00:44.128 --> 00:48.928
 I wanted to do something related to
Koto Kisei, so I just went for it.

00:48.928 --> 00:51.928
 But I couldn't do it.

00:51.928 --> 00:54.928
 I was so frustrated.

00:54.928 --> 01:01.928
 I couldn't do anything. I was so
frustrated.

01:02.740 --> 01:04.740
 I'm sorry.

01:18.810 --> 01:21.552
 See!

01:21.552 --> 01:25.552
 To all the Super Tokimeki Promoters and
Promoters!

01:25.552 --> 01:37.552
 I heard that the first Arena One More
Live, which was scheduled to be held on
August 22nd and 23rd, has been canceled.

01:37.552 --> 01:47.552
 I think it's a shame that it was the
first One More Live where the Promoters
and the members could meet.

01:47.552 --> 01:57.552
 But I'm sure that a bright future
awaits us next time, just as everyone is
singing Tomorrow's Strongest Theory.

01:57.552 --> 02:06.552
 I heard that you are looking for
another venue to hold a live stream
instead of the cancellation of this
time.

02:06.552 --> 02:12.552
 I sent you this letter because I wanted
you to use the venue this time.

02:12.552 --> 02:23.552
 I found out about Super Tokimeki
Promoters and Promoters through the blog
of Haruka Koizumi and Karami Tsuji.

02:23.552 --> 02:28.552
 It was written that it would be held at
the One More Live someday.

02:28.552 --> 02:37.552
 This time, it will be a performance
without audience, but I hope that Super
Tokimeki Promoters and Promoters will
use the venue.

02:37.552 --> 02:41.552
 Let's make the strongest day together!

02:41.552 --> 02:52.552
 We look forward to the day when we can
come together with PS and Chen Renwin
from Saitama Super Arena Tamarin.

03:11.552 --> 03:11.834
 Thank you for watching.

03:11.834 --> 03:15.834
 I'm a grandmother!

03:15.834 --> 03:19.834
 Let's get along well, I've decided my
future!

03:19.834 --> 03:22.834
 I'll do my best to enjoy it!

03:26.834 --> 03:27.834
 I'll do my best!

03:27.834 --> 03:36.834
 Let's do our best!

03:37.658 --> 03:43.658
 This program is brought to you by six
people who are active to promote
something exciting.

03:43.658 --> 04:12.658
 We are going to increase the excitement
barometer in the world by increasing the
number of people.

04:13.658 --> 04:14.400
 Thank you.

04:14.400 --> 04:19.400
 We are going to increase the excitement
barometer in the world by increasing the
number of people.

04:37.466 --> 04:39.466
 Trauma

04:39.466 --> 04:41.466
 I'll be back.

04:41.466 --> 04:43.466
 I'll be back.

04:43.466 --> 04:45.466
 I'll be back.

04:45.466 --> 04:47.466
 I'll be back.

04:52.466 --> 04:53.466
 I'm TEO.

04:53.466 --> 04:55.466
 I'm TEO.

04:55.466 --> 04:58.928
 New boy, Orange.

04:59.928 --> 05:00.928
 Yeah!

05:01.928 --> 05:08.928
 Today, I'm going to perform at Saitama
Super Arena, which I've been waiting
for.

05:10.928 --> 05:19.928
 I saw the venue and there were a lot of
people.

05:20.928 --> 05:25.928
 I was so excited.

05:25.928 --> 05:27.928
 I was surprised.

05:28.928 --> 05:30.928
 I was surprised that I was going to
perform here.

05:31.928 --> 05:33.928
 I'm so excited.

05:34.928 --> 05:38.928
 I got my hair and makeup done in a cute
way.

05:39.928 --> 05:42.928
 I'm wearing a new outfit.

05:43.928 --> 05:44.928
 It's orange.

05:45.928 --> 05:46.928
 It's so cute.

05:47.928 --> 05:50.928
 I don't know how many hours I'll be on
stage.

05:50.928 --> 05:55.928
 I still have time until the actual
performance.

05:55.928 --> 05:57.928
 I'm excited.

06:01.184 --> 06:07.184
 When the lights in the city are on, the
scent of love passes by...

06:10.224 --> 06:13.744
 the

06:13.744 --> 06:16.464
 wind

06:18.064 --> 06:20.624
 the

06:21.424 --> 06:23.544
 that

06:23.964 --> 06:26.804
 is so

06:26.804 --> 06:32.344
 that winnerWho is trying to

06:32.344 --> 06:32.384
 make Yusikawa-HI

06:32.384 --> 06:35.384
 the number one entry?

06:35.384 --> 06:37.384
 Isn't this lip color cute?

06:37.384 --> 06:41.384
 I just got a reply saying that this lip
color is cute.

06:41.384 --> 06:44.384
 It's a makeup look today.

06:44.384 --> 06:45.384
 It's so cute.

06:45.384 --> 06:46.384
 It's gross.

06:47.384 --> 06:49.384
 It's like an orange color.

06:49.384 --> 06:50.384
 Cheeks?

06:50.384 --> 06:51.384
 Cheeks.

06:51.384 --> 06:52.384
 It's cute.

06:52.384 --> 06:54.384
 It's cute.

06:54.384 --> 06:56.384
 I'm so excited about this.

06:56.384 --> 06:57.384
 Right?

06:57.384 --> 06:58.384
 With the makeup.

06:59.384 --> 07:01.384
 We still have time.

07:02.384 --> 07:03.384
 I'm so excited.

07:03.384 --> 07:08.384
 I met my mom in my school uniform this
morning.

07:08.384 --> 07:10.384
 She asked me if I was going hiking.

07:10.384 --> 07:13.384
 I was so excited.

07:13.384 --> 07:15.384
 But I was so excited with the makeup.

07:16.384 --> 07:18.384
 Hiking is too hard.

07:19.384 --> 07:20.384
 It's cute.

07:20.384 --> 07:21.384
 I'm so excited.

07:21.978 --> 07:24.978
 This costume is cute.

07:24.978 --> 07:25.978
 What else?

07:25.978 --> 07:26.978
 This one.

07:27.978 --> 07:33.978
 This ribbon is a little different from
the one we wore in the rehearsal.

07:33.978 --> 07:35.978
 This lace was not attached.

07:35.978 --> 07:37.978
 It was attached.

07:37.978 --> 07:41.978
 And there was no jewel and ribbon on
this sleeve.

07:41.978 --> 07:43.978
 But it's cute.

07:43.978 --> 07:45.978
 I'm happy.

07:45.978 --> 07:46.978
 This one?

07:46.978 --> 07:47.978
 This is cute.

07:47.978 --> 07:49.978
 It's really cute.

07:49.978 --> 07:51.978
 It's a little different.

07:53.978 --> 07:59.978
 We will do our best to enjoy this big
venue.

08:05.978 --> 08:07.978
 Two of us.

08:07.978 --> 08:08.978
 I'm Mentsu.

 You look happy.

08:27.000 --> 08:29.000
 I'm the happiest girl in the world.

08:32.000 --> 08:33.000
 Are you taking a picture?

08:33.000 --> 08:34.000
 Yes.

08:34.000 --> 08:36.000
 What are you going to ask Kaname?

08:36.000 --> 08:38.000
 I'm going to ask him about breakfast.

08:38.000 --> 08:39.000
 Yes, that's right.

08:44.000 --> 08:45.000
 What?

08:45.000 --> 08:47.000
 So you haven't changed at all?

08:49.256 --> 08:50.256
 No, I haven't.

08:50.256 --> 08:51.256
 Oh, you haven't.

08:52.256 --> 08:53.256
 I wrote a book.

08:53.256 --> 08:54.256
 Thank you.

 We are 5 years seniors.

09:17.064 --> 09:18.064
 Good morning.

09:19.064 --> 09:21.064
 We are still young.

09:22.064 --> 09:30.064
 We want to be a PR ambassador in Korea
when Aki-chan turns 20.

09:31.064 --> 09:34.064
 Aki-chan's 20th anniversary.

09:38.064 --> 09:40.064
 25th anniversary.

09:43.064 --> 09:44.064

 I want to be an ambassador as soon as

 Two things.

10:22.176 --> 10:25.176
 Mentate, Aki, Piyo.

10:25.176 --> 10:35.176

10:56.888 --> 11:04.888
 Today, we are going to ask Aki, Piyo,
Kanami about breakfast.

11:05.888 --> 11:06.888
 What do you eat for breakfast?

11:07.888 --> 11:11.888
 Today, I ate pork from the morning.

11:11.888 --> 11:14.888
 I ate pork.

11:16.888 --> 11:20.888
 I heard that pork is good for fat.

11:20.888 --> 11:23.888
 I ate it.

11:25.928 --> 11:26.928
 Natto.

11:29.928 --> 11:30.928
 Natto rice.

11:31.928 --> 11:32.928
 It's good, isn't it?

11:32.928 --> 11:33.928
 It's good.

11:34.928 --> 11:35.928
 How about you, Aki-chan?

11:35.928 --> 11:37.928
 I ate dry curry for dinner yesterday.

11:37.928 --> 11:39.928
 I'll eat the rest of it.

11:40.928 --> 11:42.928
 I'll eat natto rice with you.

11:42.928 --> 11:44.928
 It's okay. I'll refrain from it.

11:45.928 --> 11:46.928
 I hate natto.

11:48.928 --> 11:49.928
 I'll eat it.

11:49.928 --> 11:50.928
 I'll refrain from it.

11:50.928 --> 11:51.928
 It's a stick.

11:57.978 --> 12:01.978
 I'm waiting for you!

12:11.674 --> 12:13.674
 But, wow!

12:14.674 --> 12:16.674
 The light is on!

 Wow!

12:20.674 --> 12:21.674

 It looks great.

12:24.674 --> 12:25.674
 The light is on.

12:30.674 --> 12:32.674
 I'm wearing a ponytail today.

 Why are you behind me?

13:14.506 --> 13:16.506
 I'm afraid you'll come out.

13:17.506 --> 13:18.506
 Cute.

13:19.506 --> 13:27.506
 I'll use this big screen to make the
fans on the screen look good.

13:27.506 --> 13:28.506
 Wow, it's amazing.

13:28.506 --> 13:30.506
 Wow, it's amazing.

13:33.576 --> 13:37.576
 Today is the first time we use the
center stage.

13:38.576 --> 13:42.576
 I think it will be a fresh live
performance which is different from
usual.

13:43.576 --> 13:49.576
 We will do our best to show you our new
charm.

13:50.576 --> 13:51.576
 We have a new song, too.

13:51.576 --> 13:55.576
 It's a good song, so please look
forward to it.

14:42.138 --> 14:46.368
 With that being said, I'll do the cab

14:46.628 --> 14:48.628
 I'm going to be a big fan of Osu-bun!

14:49.628 --> 14:51.628
 Today's lunch is

14:51.628 --> 14:53.628
 Sumimi-yaki, a black pork steak

14:53.628 --> 14:55.628
 This place's lunch is really good

14:55.628 --> 14:57.628
 The onion on top of the lunch

14:57.628 --> 14:59.628
 is really crispy

14:59.628 --> 15:01.628
 and delicious

15:01.628 --> 15:03.628
 I'm really happy

15:03.628 --> 15:05.628
 I'm going to eat it someday

15:05.628 --> 15:07.628
 Did you take a picture?

15:07.628 --> 15:09.628
 No

15:09.628 --> 15:11.628
 I took all of them

15:11.628 --> 15:13.628
 This is really good

15:13.628 --> 15:15.628
 It's really good

15:15.628 --> 15:17.628
 Let's eat

15:17.628 --> 15:19.628

 It's so big.

16:27.226 --> 16:28.226

16:28.226 --> 16:33.226
 When I ran, I felt like I was in the
4th place.

16:33.226 --> 16:35.226
 It was so fun.

16:35.226 --> 16:37.226
 It was so fun.

16:37.226 --> 16:39.226
 I was so excited.

16:39.226 --> 16:41.226
 It was so fun.

16:41.226 --> 16:43.226
 I was the No.1.

16:43.226 --> 16:45.226
 Thank you.

16:45.680 --> 16:47.680
 I'm going to win if I'm on the floor.

16:47.680 --> 16:48.680
