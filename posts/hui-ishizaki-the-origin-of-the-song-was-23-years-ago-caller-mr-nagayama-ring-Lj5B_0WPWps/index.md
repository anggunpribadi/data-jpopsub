"RING³" (Rin Rin Rin) is a YouTube chat content that cuts out the elements through the phone.
Until I try to talk, I don't know who the other person is or what the purpose is. There is only a real face, a real voice, and a real feeling here.

In the 11th episode, Huey Ishizaki makes his first appearance. Her phone partner is Mr. Nagayama, the director who wrote the script for the stage that Ishizaki experienced for the first time.
A reunion over the phone after 20 years, memories of the first play, and simple words that Ishizaki seeks in the lyrics. The origin of the artist Huey Ishizaki is now clear.
