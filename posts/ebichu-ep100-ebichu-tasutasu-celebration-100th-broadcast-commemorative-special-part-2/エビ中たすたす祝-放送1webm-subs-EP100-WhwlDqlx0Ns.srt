This program is brought to you by the
following sponsors.

19
00:01:17,474 --> 00:01:22,474
Ebichu Tastasu, which started in 2015,
has finally reached 100 episodes.

20
00:01:23,474 --> 00:01:29,474
So, this time as well, we have a special
edition of the 100th episode of the
luxury goods battle.

21
00:01:30,474 --> 00:01:33,474
The winner of the bowling competition
last time was...

22
00:01:33,474 --> 00:01:36,474

23
00:01:36,474 --> 00:01:40,474

00:01:40,474 --> 00:01:44,474
And the winner of the second round
was...

25
00:01:44,474 --> 00:01:47,474
Tomoto Kawashima!

26
00:01:48,186 --> 00:01:53,186
They couldn't get the chance to get the
luxury goods.

27
00:01:53,186 --> 00:01:57,186
Will they get the luxury goods this
time?

28
00:01:57,186 --> 00:01:59,186
The third round starts.

29
00:01:59,186 --> 00:02:02,186
We came to Karaoke Box.

30
00:02:02,186 --> 00:02:07,186
We will have a Karaoke battle for 100
seconds.

31
00:02:08,186 --> 00:02:11,186
This Karaoke battle is a relay.

32
00:02:11,186 --> 00:02:13,186
They sing while turning the microphone.

33
00:02:13,186 --> 00:02:16,186
The person who sings the song first
measures the time.

34
00:02:16,186 --> 00:02:20,186
The member who sings the song in 100
seconds will be eliminated.

35
00:02:20,186 --> 00:02:24,186
The member who sings the song during the
show will be selected.

36
00:02:25,186 --> 00:02:31,186
The person who sings the song and
remains in the end will be eliminated.

37
00:02:31,186 --> 00:02:35,186
Let's choose a song.

38
00:02:35,186 --> 00:02:38,186
Let's look at the ranking.

39
00:02:38,186 --> 00:02:40,186
That's good.

40
00:02:40,186 --> 00:02:42,186
The ranking of the songs during the
show.

41
00:02:42,186 --> 00:02:43,186
Will it be there?

42
00:02:43,186 --> 00:02:46,186
Which song?

43
00:02:46,186 --> 00:02:47,186
I will contribute.

44
00:02:47,186 --> 00:02:49,186
Let's run more.

45
00:02:49,186 --> 00:02:51,186
Let's run more.

46
00:02:51,186 --> 00:02:54,186
Let's contribute to the person who sings
the song at the end.

47
00:02:54,186 --> 00:02:55,186
That's good.

48
00:02:55,186 --> 00:02:57,186
I didn't expect that the person would
sing.

49
00:02:57,186 --> 00:02:59,186
The order is the same.

50
00:02:59,186 --> 00:03:02,186
The first person is advantageous.

51
00:03:02,186 --> 00:03:04,186
Let's decide by lottery.

52
00:03:04,186 --> 00:03:06,186
I will start.

53
00:03:06,186 --> 00:03:07,186
This is it.

54
00:03:07,186 --> 00:03:08,186
Stop.

55
00:03:09,186 --> 00:03:10,186
Kashiwagi.

56
00:03:10,186 --> 00:03:12,186
That's good.

57
00:03:12,186 --> 00:03:15,186
The first round is 100 seconds and 200
seconds.

58
00:03:15,186 --> 00:03:18,186
One person will be eliminated.

59
00:03:18,186 --> 00:03:21,186
The battle starts in 100 seconds.

60
00:03:21,186 --> 00:03:32,186
The first person is advantageous.

61
00:03:32,506 --> 00:03:35,506
As expected, even in a place where there
is nothing

62
00:03:35,506 --> 00:03:37,506
It's because it's Hong Jin-young

63
00:03:39,506 --> 00:03:41,506
You sing for a long time

64
00:03:42,506 --> 00:03:43,506
I don't know

65
00:03:43,506 --> 00:03:46,832

I can't lose. I can't lose.

68
00:03:54,832 --> 00:03:56,832
I'm not good at this.

69
00:03:56,832 --> 00:04:03,832
I've sacrificed my day off and my day
off.

70
00:04:03,832 --> 00:04:10,832
I'm going to cry.

71
00:04:11,912 --> 00:04:13,912
I'm going to cry.

72
00:04:15,912 --> 00:04:17,912
I'm going to cry.

73
00:04:19,912 --> 00:04:21,912
I'm going to cry.

74
00:04:23,912 --> 00:04:25,912
I'm going to cry.

75
00:04:25,912 --> 00:04:31,936

00:04:31,936 --> 00:04:34,936
We are having a secret sports day!

77
00:04:34,936 --> 00:04:39,936
Even if you have to bow down to us

78
00:04:39,936 --> 00:04:41,936
Let's work together!

79
00:04:41,936 --> 00:04:48,936
We are having a secret sports day!

80
00:04:48,936 --> 00:04:50,936

81
00:04:50,936 --> 00:04:52,936
Please sing with us!

82
00:04:52,936 --> 00:04:55,936
We don't want to lose!

83
00:04:55,936 --> 00:04:57,936
La la la la la!

84
00:04:57,936 --> 00:04:58,936
Yes!

85
00:04:58,936 --> 00:05:00,936
Good!

86
00:05:02,936 --> 00:05:04,936
The white-haired host is faster.

87
00:05:04,936 --> 00:05:05,936
No, I'm not.

88
00:05:05,936 --> 00:05:07,936
I'm faster.

89
00:05:07,936 --> 00:05:08,936
White-haired!

90
00:05:08,936 --> 00:05:10,936
Yes!

91
00:05:10,936 --> 00:05:12,936
Keep going!

92
00:05:12,936 --> 00:05:15,936
Just 100 seconds before the line,

93
00:05:15,936 --> 00:05:18,936
Maya is the first one to fall.

94
00:05:18,936 --> 00:05:22,936
And after 100 seconds, another one
falls.

95
00:05:22,936 --> 00:05:28,936
Run more! Run more!

96
00:05:28,936 --> 00:05:30,936
The end!

97
00:05:33,530 --> 00:05:36,530
I'm going to pull the mic.

98
00:05:37,530 --> 00:05:39,530
It's cool if this is out.

99
00:05:39,530 --> 00:05:40,530
I agree.

100
00:05:40,530 --> 00:05:45,530
Because the dream is right there.

101
00:05:45,530 --> 00:05:48,530
I can't finish my dream.

102
00:05:48,530 --> 00:05:54,530
I'm going to run.

103
00:05:54,530 --> 00:05:59,530
I've been crying all this time.

104
00:05:59,530 --> 00:06:01,968
I've noticed.

105
00:06:02,968 --> 00:06:05,968
Friendship Sports Day

106
00:06:05,968 --> 00:06:10,968
Even if you lose now

107
00:06:11,968 --> 00:06:16,968
Believe in the reversal and go forward

108
00:06:16,968 --> 00:06:22,968
Even if you are timid, you will melt in
the autumn sky

109
00:06:22,968 --> 00:06:28,968
I'm not afraid

110
00:06:29,632 --> 00:06:32,112
N Transforming into a Pokeball

111
00:06:38,112 --> 00:06:39,752
Turn off the music

112
00:06:39,752 --> 00:06:40,752
Bye bye!

113
00:06:42,592 --> 00:06:44,592
It's a little creepy.

114
00:06:44,592 --> 00:06:46,592
I'll do it well.

115
00:06:46,592 --> 00:06:50,592
I wanted to sing.

116
00:06:50,592 --> 00:06:55,592
If you let me sing, I'll be Hirota.

117
00:06:55,592 --> 00:06:58,592
By the way, who sang the part now?

118
00:06:58,592 --> 00:07:01,592
No one sang.

119
00:07:03,592 --> 00:07:07,592
Mayama and Yasumoto are eliminated, and
6 people remain.

120
00:07:07,592 --> 00:07:12,592
The two who were eliminated have nothing
to do.

121
00:07:12,592 --> 00:07:15,592
I'm just standing behind you, so I'm not
good at this world.

122
00:07:15,592 --> 00:07:19,744
Thank you for your cooperation.

123
00:07:20,744 --> 00:07:23,744
Please cheer up Ebichu-nee-san.

124
00:07:24,744 --> 00:07:26,744
The rule of the second round is...

125
00:07:27,744 --> 00:07:30,744
4 people will be eliminated every 60
seconds.

126
00:07:32,744 --> 00:07:35,744
And the time for the new member to be
eliminated is...

127
00:07:39,744 --> 00:07:42,744
But if Chuu-ei is eliminated in 60
seconds, she will be eliminated.

128
00:07:42,744 --> 00:07:44,880
Please go with me.

129
00:07:45,880 --> 00:07:47,880
This time, all four of them will be
eliminated at once.

130
00:07:47,880 --> 00:07:51,880
The second round of karaoke battle
starts.

131
00:08:13,872 --> 00:08:15,872
It's pretty good.

132
00:08:15,872 --> 00:08:16,872
Hiroto!

133
00:08:16,872 --> 00:08:18,872
Hiroto, you're doing pretty good.

134
00:08:19,872 --> 00:08:20,872
Thank you.

135
00:08:20,872 --> 00:08:21,872
Turn it around.

136
00:08:21,872 --> 00:08:23,872
The show is starting.

137
00:08:25,872 --> 00:08:26,872
Hiroto, wait.

138
00:08:26,872 --> 00:08:39,472
Thank you for watching!

139
00:08:40,332 --> 00:08:42,332
I love you Kyo-tan!

140
00:08:51,472 --> 00:08:53,472
You guys are the best!

141
00:08:54,232 --> 00:08:55,692
Yeah!

142
00:09:03,770 --> 00:09:05,770
The situation, the situation

143
00:09:05,770 --> 00:09:08,770
I want to call it a school game

144
00:09:08,770 --> 00:09:11,770
But I arrived here

145
00:09:11,770 --> 00:09:15,770
I want to go to the next step

146
00:09:15,770 --> 00:09:18,770
I'll leave it to the adults

147
00:09:18,770 --> 00:09:21,770
If you don't have your own value

148
00:09:21,770 --> 00:09:24,770
Why put it over the issue

149
00:09:24,770 --> 00:09:26,770
If you don't have your own value

150
00:09:26,770 --> 00:09:28,770
If you don't like it, you can't do it

151
00:09:28,770 --> 00:09:31,546
I can't do it

152
00:09:31,546 --> 00:09:38,546
I can't go home until I finish my
homework.

153
00:09:38,546 --> 00:09:43,194
I can't go home until I finish my
homework.

154
00:09:49,136 --> 00:09:51,136
I'm sorry!

155
00:09:51,136 --> 00:09:53,136
I'm sorry!

156
00:09:53,136 --> 00:09:55,136
I didn't mean to do that!

157
00:09:55,136 --> 00:09:59,136
I want to be a hero!

158
00:09:59,136 --> 00:10:03,136
I have about 8 million eggs

159
00:10:03,136 --> 00:10:05,136
in my stomach every day!

160
00:10:05,136 --> 00:10:07,136
Boom! Boom! Boom! Boom!

161
00:10:07,136 --> 00:10:09,136
Gi-O-P-P-O!

162
00:10:09,136 --> 00:10:11,136
I'm a hero!

163
00:10:11,136 --> 00:10:13,136

I'm a hero!

166
00:10:17,136 --> 00:10:19,136
Gi-O-P-P-O!

167
00:10:20,280 --> 00:10:23,280
I'm going to show you the most exciting
dance.

168
00:10:33,280 --> 00:10:36,280
Kiroppo! Kiroppo!

169
00:10:36,280 --> 00:10:39,280
Don't forget your head!

170
00:10:39,280 --> 00:10:42,280
S.M.X!

171
00:10:42,280 --> 00:10:45,280

172
00:10:45,280 --> 00:10:46,106
Oh yeah!

173
00:10:46,106 --> 00:10:47,106
Power!

174
00:10:47,106 --> 00:10:48,106

00:10:51,106 --> 00:10:53,106
What a surprise! 60 seconds!

176
00:10:53,106 --> 00:10:55,106
Unexpectedly, the middle-A out!

177
00:10:56,106 --> 00:10:58,106
With this, one more person will be
eliminated.

178
00:10:58,106 --> 00:11:19,106
Who will be the winner?

179
00:11:20,840 --> 00:11:22,840
I'm so excited!

180
00:11:22,840 --> 00:11:24,840
I'm so excited!

181
00:11:24,840 --> 00:11:26,840
I'm going to win!

182
00:11:26,840 --> 00:11:28,840
I'm so happy!

183
00:11:28,840 --> 00:11:30,840
Thank you for the food!

184
00:11:30,840 --> 00:11:32,840
This is my...

185
00:11:32,840 --> 00:11:35,840
I'm the boy, Ebichu Terikura!

186
00:11:35,840 --> 00:11:37,840
Thank you for the food!

187
00:11:39,840 --> 00:11:41,840
So...

188
00:11:41,840 --> 00:11:45,840
Hoshina Kobayashi from Makino is out!

189
00:11:45,840 --> 00:11:47,840
No!

190
00:11:47,840 --> 00:11:49,530
I'm out!

191
00:11:49,530 --> 00:11:52,530
Chuuei-san, it's not even related to the
song.

192
00:11:52,530 --> 00:11:55,530
I was shocked when the whistle sounded.

193
00:11:55,530 --> 00:11:57,530
I was shocked too.

194
00:11:57,530 --> 00:12:00,530
And the people who are singing are more
excited than the people who are singing.

195
00:12:00,530 --> 00:12:03,530
They are really standing out.

196
00:12:09,530 --> 00:12:13,530
The second round has ended, and the
remaining members are these three.

197
00:12:13,530 --> 00:12:20,530
The next battle was supposed to be the
final, but Chuuei's unexpected
elimination changed the plan.

198
00:12:20,530 --> 00:12:28,848
Who will advance to the final?

199
00:12:29,848 --> 00:12:31,848
One person will be eliminated in 60
seconds.

200
00:12:31,848 --> 00:12:33,848
The semi-final starts now.

201
00:12:33,848 --> 00:12:47,848
Start!

202
00:12:47,898 --> 00:12:54,898
Thank you for watching!

203
00:12:55,152 --> 00:12:57,152
Only threeogan Kanako

204
00:12:59,912 --> 00:13:01,772
The first round gogogo

205
00:13:01,772 --> 00:13:03,612
Not a well-bared

206
00:13:08,352 --> 00:13:10,152
In the second round rock to rock

207
00:13:10,192 --> 00:13:11,672
You can do nothing

208
00:13:11,672 --> 00:13:13,552
But going further and further

209
00:13:14,952 --> 00:13:17,452
but effort and effort and effort and
Effort

210
00:13:17,452 --> 00:13:19,452
Effort is not betrayed

211
00:13:21,812 --> 00:13:23,112
Hafru

212
00:13:23,112 --> 00:13:24,332
Production

213
00:13:24,332 --> 00:13:26,332
I won't give up!

214
00:13:26,332 --> 00:13:29,332
No matter how tough the road is,

215
00:13:29,332 --> 00:13:35,332
I'll believe in myself and go on!

216
00:13:38,332 --> 00:13:40,332
Nakayama out!

217
00:13:43,332 --> 00:13:45,332
Nakayama was pulling quite a bit.

218
00:13:45,332 --> 00:13:49,332
We're the kings! We're the kings!

219
00:13:49,332 --> 00:13:51,332
We're the kings!

220
00:13:51,332 --> 00:13:54,332
We're going to a fun place.

221
00:13:55,332 --> 00:13:57,332
Welcome!

222
00:13:58,332 --> 00:14:00,332
I'll give you this!

00:14:00,332 --> 00:14:02,332
I'll give you this!

224
00:14:02,332 --> 00:14:04,332
I'll give you this!

225
00:14:06,332 --> 00:14:08,332
Chie-san, you're like Okamaba.

226
00:14:08,332 --> 00:14:09,332
Stop it!

227
00:14:09,332 --> 00:14:11,332
I'll give you this!

228
00:14:13,332 --> 00:14:16,332
So, the next one is the final round!

229
00:14:16,332 --> 00:14:18,332
What's the song for the final round?

230
00:14:18,332 --> 00:14:21,332
It's SADOWN!

231
00:14:21,332 --> 00:14:24,332
The final round will be Hirota and
Kashiwagi!

232
00:14:24,332 --> 00:14:26,332
They'll battle for the 100-second note!

233
00:14:26,332 --> 00:14:29,332
Who will win?

234
00:14:29,332 --> 00:14:31,332
But before that...

235
00:14:31,332 --> 00:14:34,332
Sakura Ebi's first round!

236
00:14:34,332 --> 00:14:39,332
The research unit Sakura Ebi's is in the
middle of their debut.

237
00:14:39,332 --> 00:14:44,332
They held their 6th one-man live last
month.

238
00:14:44,332 --> 00:14:48,332
This time, it's the biggest live show
ever.

239
00:14:48,332 --> 00:14:54,332
And the youngest, Serizawa Moa, will be
performing for the first time.

240
00:14:54,332 --> 00:14:59,792
What kind of live will it be?

241
00:15:00,792 --> 00:15:06,792
I'm looking for a peach sandals with
glasses and shoes that are beautiful and

I want to be a princess

250
00:15:31,498 --> 00:15:37,498
But I wonder if the prince will turn
around

251
00:15:37,498 --> 00:15:42,498
I want to be a princess

252
00:15:42,498 --> 00:15:46,498
Who can protect the people

00:15:49,498 --> 00:15:52,498
I want to grow my hair

255
00:15:52,498 --> 00:15:55,498
I want to be a princess

256
00:15:56,122 --> 00:15:58,042
I'm NOT really sure about this city…

257
00:16:00,362 --> 00:16:02,302
24 hours a day without leisure

258
00:16:02,302 --> 00:16:04,362
and a heatwave

259
00:16:04,362 --> 00:16:05,242
I'm drating past myself

260
00:16:05,242 --> 00:16:06,342
with this day

261
00:16:06,342 --> 00:16:07,342
Every morning I'm more energetic

262
00:16:07,342 --> 00:16:08,442
I'm just concerned about tomorrow

263
00:16:08,742 --> 00:16:11,242
I want love essential

264
00:16:11,242 --> 00:16:14,142
I just want to be alone!

265
00:16:14,330 --> 00:16:24,970
Flip the plushies!

266
00:16:25,114 --> 00:16:28,114
Just look at me

267
00:16:28,114 --> 00:16:31,114
Please, prince

268
00:16:31,114 --> 00:16:34,114
Please look at me

269
00:16:34,114 --> 00:16:36,114
A-I-A-I-A

00:16:36,114 --> 00:16:37,114
Together

271
00:16:37,114 --> 00:16:39,114
A-I-I-O-I-O

272
00:16:39,114 --> 00:16:41,696
I want to shine

273
00:16:42,696 --> 00:16:45,696
Right here, right now

274
00:16:46,696 --> 00:16:50,696
To a beautiful future

275
00:16:51,696 --> 00:16:55,696
We're connected

276
00:16:55,696 --> 00:17:01,696
Don't give up on your dreams

277
00:17:01,696 --> 00:17:05,530
Don't doubt it

278
00:17:05,530 --> 00:17:10,530
I want to keep running

279
00:17:10,530 --> 00:17:13,530
I believe

280
00:17:13,530 --> 00:17:17,530
Beyond the tears

281
00:17:17,530 --> 00:17:22,530
Beyond the long night

282
00:17:22,530 --> 00:17:28,530
Until the day the morning sun rises

283
00:17:28,826 --> 00:17:35,326
On the way to the end of the dream

284
00:17:35,326 --> 00:17:42,326
We are shining now

285
00:17:42,326 --> 00:17:50,326
We are shining now

286
00:18:02,874 --> 00:18:05,874
The members who finished the live show

287
00:18:05,874 --> 00:18:12,874
I was worried about my physical
strength, but I think I did better than
I thought.

288
00:18:12,874 --> 00:18:16,874
This is the first one-man live show in
2017.

289
00:18:16,874 --> 00:18:20,874
I want to grow more and do my best at
the live show.

290
00:18:20,874 --> 00:18:24,874
Thank you very much for coming.

291
00:18:24,874 --> 00:18:27,874
The next one-man live show will also be
held.

Hey! You're my classmate, right?

305
00:20:19,056 --> 00:20:21,056
No, I'm your classmate.

306
00:20:21,056 --> 00:20:23,056
Wait, wait, don't be nervous.

307
00:20:23,056 --> 00:20:47,056
I'm the winner!

308
00:20:49,120 --> 00:20:56,120
1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th, 5th, 6th, 7th,
8th...

309
00:20:56,120 --> 00:20:57,840
9th, 10th, 11th...

310
00:20:57,840 --> 00:21:01,340
I'm not good at it, but this is tough.

311
00:21:01,340 --> 00:21:05,120
10th, 11th, 12th, 13th, 14th, 15th...

312
00:21:05,120 --> 00:21:07,680
I'm going to go with 2 people.

313
00:21:07,680 --> 00:21:16,880
Ai, Ai, Ai, Ai...

314
00:21:18,560 --> 00:21:21,080
You are slow!

315
00:21:21,080 --> 00:21:29,680
Ai Ai Ai, It's 2!.etty!

316
00:21:29,680 --> 00:21:32,320
There's two more places left.

317
00:21:32,320 --> 00:21:36,920
Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey!

318
00:21:36,920 --> 00:21:37,920
Hang in there!

319
00:21:37,920 --> 00:21:42,920
Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey!

320
00:21:42,920 --> 00:21:45,920
I have nothing more to say!

321
00:21:45,920 --> 00:21:49,658
Bye-bye!

322
00:21:49,658 --> 00:21:55,658
Ai Ai, if you save me, Ai Ai will become
Venus.

323
00:21:55,658 --> 00:21:59,658
I don't need Venus, I only need my
beloved father.

324
00:22:00,658 --> 00:22:03,658
That's right, we are all cats.

325
00:22:04,658 --> 00:22:08,658
We've come this far together.

326
00:22:08,658 --> 00:22:16,658
Ai Ai, if you save me, Ai Ai will become
Venus.

327
00:22:19,464 --> 00:22:23,464
The winner is Hirota!

328
00:22:25,464 --> 00:22:28,464
That was a good match.

329
00:22:29,464 --> 00:22:31,464
Thank you!

330
00:22:32,464 --> 00:22:36,464
I don't know the names of the losers
anymore.

331
00:22:36,464 --> 00:22:39,464
There are only 2 people left.

332
00:22:39,464 --> 00:22:44,464
The winner of the 100-second karaoke
battle is Hirota Ai.

333
00:22:44,464 --> 00:22:49,464
The winner Hirota will try to get the
luxury goods.

334
00:22:51,464 --> 00:22:54,464
Will she get the luxury goods other than
the towels?

335
00:22:54,464 --> 00:22:58,464
Will she get the miracle 1 million yen
chance?

336
00:22:58,464 --> 00:23:02,464
So, Hirota, where are you aiming?

337
00:23:02,464 --> 00:23:06,464
Everyone is wearing towels, so I want to
get the color.

338
00:23:06,464 --> 00:23:08,464
That's right.

339
00:23:08,464 --> 00:23:11,464
This block is definitely...

340
00:23:11,464 --> 00:23:15,464
If you aim at the block, you can get it.

341
00:23:15,464 --> 00:23:17,464
Please decide quickly.

342
00:23:18,464 --> 00:23:21,464
The fate of Hirota Ai is...

343
00:23:21,464 --> 00:23:24,464
What will happen?

344
00:23:25,832 --> 00:23:27,832
Rock, paper, scissors!

345
00:23:40,832 --> 00:23:41,832
Rock, paper, scissors!

346
00:23:41,832 --> 00:23:43,832
One more time!

347
00:23:48,160 --> 00:23:49,160
Amazing!

348
00:23:49,160 --> 00:23:54,160
They got the annual passports of Tokyo
Doitsumura

349
00:23:54,160 --> 00:23:56,160
Nakayama has one too

350
00:23:56,160 --> 00:23:58,160
Nakayama has one

351
00:23:58,160 --> 00:24:01,160
By the way, did Nakayama go with his
annual passports?

352
00:24:01,160 --> 00:24:03,160
He's sleeping in his backpack

353
00:24:03,160 --> 00:24:06,160
Sleeping in his backpack

354
00:24:06,160 --> 00:24:08,160
Then, you can go with Hiroto

355
00:24:08,160 --> 00:24:11,160
I want to go without sleeping

356
00:24:11,160 --> 00:24:16,160
We've done 100 times commemorative
special twice

357
00:24:16,160 --> 00:24:19,160
Lastly, Nana

358
00:24:19,160 --> 00:24:22,160
See you again!

359
00:24:33,050 --> 00:24:37,050
Ebitu Tastasu, the last two times.

360
00:24:37,050 --> 00:24:39,050
Did your heart hurt?

361
00:24:39,050 --> 00:24:45,050
After that, I saw the dream of getting
along with Nakayama-chan twice.

362
00:24:51,050 --> 00:24:55,050
This program was brought to you by the
