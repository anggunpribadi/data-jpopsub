1
00:00:00,250 --> 00:00:07,250
This time's Ebichu Tastas is a special
project for the new season, the Dream
Let's Make It Come True Special!

2
00:00:08,250 --> 00:00:09,250
Here!

3
00:00:09,250 --> 00:00:13,250
When the members' dreams come true,
there's a surprising development!

4
00:00:13,250 --> 00:00:15,250
Who is this person?

5
00:00:15,250 --> 00:00:19,250
At the end, everyone is in a serious
hide-and-seek!

6
00:00:19,250 --> 00:00:21,250
Here he comes!

7
00:00:21,250 --> 00:00:32,656
Ebichu Tastas, start!

8
00:00:32,656 --> 00:00:36,656
The feeling of love is so high

9
00:00:36,656 --> 00:00:40,656
I'm so crazy about you

10
00:00:40,656 --> 00:00:45,656
What should I do with my heart?

11
00:00:45,656 --> 00:00:50,656
Moratorium, moratorium, moratorium,
middle school

12
00:00:50,656 --> 00:00:54,656
Add various things to private Ebisu
middle school

13
00:00:56,656 --> 00:00:58,656
Ebichu Tastas

14
00:00:58,656 --> 00:01:00,656
To be continued

15
00:01:02,512 --> 00:01:07,512
This program is brought to you by the
following sponsors.

16
00:01:16,282 --> 00:01:21,602
This time, I, Kobayashi, will be your
host

17
00:01:21,602 --> 00:01:25,202
I'll start with the car-shaped-yokan

18
00:01:25,202 --> 00:01:28,202
It's a unique atmosphere

19
00:01:28,202 --> 00:01:29,282
It's modern

20
00:01:29,282 --> 00:01:31,282
Modern, modern

21
00:01:31,282 --> 00:01:34,282
What's this mysterious dance?

22
00:01:34,282 --> 00:01:37,282
There's no Hoshina

23
00:01:37,282 --> 00:01:41,282
There seems to be another job, so I'll
be late

24
00:01:41,282 --> 00:01:42,282
Oh, is that so?

25
00:01:42,282 --> 00:01:44,282
So please wait a moment

26
00:01:44,282 --> 00:01:46,282
What are you going to do today?

27
00:01:46,282 --> 00:01:48,282
This time, Ebichu Tastosu

28
00:01:48,282 --> 00:01:50,064
I'm coming

29
00:01:50,064 --> 00:01:52,064
This is a dream

30
00:01:52,064 --> 00:01:54,064
It's written here

31
00:01:54,064 --> 00:01:58,064
New Year's special project, Let's make
our dreams come true special

32
00:02:02,064 --> 00:02:06,064
A project suitable for the new year to
make the members' dreams come true

33
00:02:06,064 --> 00:02:08,064
Coming this year

34
00:02:08,624 --> 00:02:11,624
If there is a dream that will come true,
there is a dream that won't come true

35
00:02:11,624 --> 00:02:13,624
That is reality

36
00:02:13,624 --> 00:02:19,624
Whether the dream will come true or not,
the judge is the director of the dream
selection

37
00:02:19,624 --> 00:02:22,624
What kind of dream are the members
dreaming of?

38
00:02:22,624 --> 00:02:25,624
And how many will come true?

39
00:02:25,624 --> 00:02:27,624
First, the first dream is this

40
00:02:29,624 --> 00:02:32,624
The members want to do a Hawaii location

41
00:02:32,624 --> 00:02:34,624
Who is this?

42
00:02:34,624 --> 00:02:36,624
Matsuno

43
00:02:36,624 --> 00:02:38,624
What does this mean?

44
00:02:38,624 --> 00:02:44,624
We have always wanted to go to Hawaii

45
00:02:44,624 --> 00:02:51,624
If we do a Hawaii location and have a
sports day, I think we can get something

46
00:02:51,624 --> 00:02:55,624
Like a prize

47
00:02:55,624 --> 00:02:58,624
Let's think of Hawaii location

48
00:02:58,624 --> 00:03:00,624
Matsuno, you are from Japan

49
00:03:00,624 --> 00:03:02,624
This is Hawaii

50
00:03:02,624 --> 00:03:06,624
Behind us is the sea

51
00:03:06,624 --> 00:03:09,624
It's a sand beach

52
00:03:09,624 --> 00:03:11,624
Ready, start!

53
00:03:15,632 --> 00:03:18,672
We've also been drinking during the
week.

54
00:03:18,672 --> 00:03:21,472
So, this time we've had it up our
sleeve.

55
00:03:21,472 --> 00:03:22,612
Woohoo ~~

56
00:03:22,932 --> 00:03:25,552
The top three reached hundred cells

57
00:03:25,552 --> 00:03:26,452
Woohoo ~~

58
00:03:26,452 --> 00:03:28,336
Thank you!

59
00:03:28,336 --> 00:03:29,336
Yes!

60
00:03:29,336 --> 00:03:30,336
You're here!

61
00:03:30,336 --> 00:03:31,336
Yes!

62
00:03:31,336 --> 00:03:33,336
What are we doing for the sports day?

63
00:03:33,336 --> 00:03:34,336
Sports day?

64
00:03:34,336 --> 00:03:39,336
First, let's do beach flag together.

65
00:03:39,336 --> 00:03:40,336
Oh, that's good!

66
00:03:41,336 --> 00:03:42,336
That's good!

67
00:03:42,336 --> 00:03:43,336
And?

68
00:03:43,336 --> 00:03:44,336
Let's decide the team!

69
00:03:44,336 --> 00:03:45,336
Oh, team!

70
00:03:47,336 --> 00:03:48,336
Like that?

71
00:03:48,336 --> 00:03:49,336
Yes!

72
00:03:50,336 --> 00:03:52,336
Let's go to the judgment.

73
00:03:53,336 --> 00:03:57,336
Will Matsuno's dream, Hawaii location,
come true?

74
00:03:57,336 --> 00:03:59,336
Let's go to the judgment.

75
00:04:00,336 --> 00:04:03,336
Which team do you want to go to Hawaii
with?

76
00:04:03,336 --> 00:04:05,336
1, 2, 3!

77
00:04:05,336 --> 00:04:06,816
Team Hawaii!

78
00:04:07,816 --> 00:04:09,816
The budget is really high

79
00:04:10,816 --> 00:04:12,816
By the way, from the producer

80
00:04:13,816 --> 00:04:15,816
It's possible if Matsuno-san is alone

81
00:04:15,816 --> 00:04:16,816
Really?

82
00:04:16,816 --> 00:04:17,816
What do you think?

83
00:04:17,816 --> 00:04:19,816
I'm not sure

84
00:04:20,816 --> 00:04:22,816
I'll answer later

85
00:04:24,816 --> 00:04:26,816
I'll go later

86
00:04:28,816 --> 00:04:30,816
Next is this

87
00:04:30,816 --> 00:04:35,816
I want to record Ebichu Tastas under the
aurora

88
00:04:35,816 --> 00:04:37,816
Who is this?

89
00:04:37,816 --> 00:04:38,816
NG!

90
00:04:38,816 --> 00:04:40,816
So fast!

91
00:04:41,816 --> 00:04:43,816
It's more expensive than Hawaii

92
00:04:45,816 --> 00:04:47,816
Two consecutive dreams didn't come true

93
00:04:47,816 --> 00:04:49,816
It's hard to make it come true

94
00:04:49,816 --> 00:04:51,816
What will happen next?

95
00:04:51,816 --> 00:04:53,816
Here!

96
00:04:55,256 --> 00:04:56,256
Uno!

97
00:04:57,256 --> 00:04:58,256
It's me!

98
00:04:58,256 --> 00:05:00,256
What is this? Uno?

99
00:05:00,256 --> 00:05:02,256
Uno is funny

100
00:05:02,256 --> 00:05:03,256
No, no, no

101
00:05:03,256 --> 00:05:04,256
It's really funny

102
00:05:04,256 --> 00:05:06,256
We've been doing Uno in Guam

103
00:05:06,256 --> 00:05:11,256
When we were in Guam during the photo
shoot

104
00:05:11,256 --> 00:05:13,256
The rooms were divided into 4 rooms

105
00:05:13,256 --> 00:05:15,256
It was a big room

106
00:05:15,256 --> 00:05:19,256
So we all got up late at night and did
Uno together

107
00:05:19,256 --> 00:05:20,256
It was really fun

108
00:05:20,256 --> 00:05:21,256
It was fun

109
00:05:21,256 --> 00:05:22,256
It was really fun

110
00:05:22,256 --> 00:05:24,256
You wanted to do it together like that
night?

111
00:05:24,256 --> 00:05:25,256
Yes

112
00:05:25,256 --> 00:05:27,256
I understand. Then, the president of the
committee

113
00:05:27,256 --> 00:05:28,256
Please!

114
00:05:28,256 --> 00:05:29,256
Please!

115
00:05:29,256 --> 00:05:30,256
I want to do it

116
00:05:30,256 --> 00:05:31,256
I want to do it too

117
00:05:31,256 --> 00:05:33,256
1, 2, 3

118
00:05:33,256 --> 00:05:34,256
Yes!

119
00:05:36,256 --> 00:05:37,256
We did it!

120
00:05:38,256 --> 00:05:41,256
If Uno didn't make it, the game would
have been over

121
00:05:42,256 --> 00:05:45,256
Yasumoto's dream, Uno will make it

122
00:05:45,256 --> 00:05:48,256
Let's have fun as much as we want

123
00:05:48,256 --> 00:05:52,256
Let's do it with the music of Paxi

124
00:05:52,256 --> 00:05:53,256
Yes

125
00:05:53,256 --> 00:05:54,256
What is it?

126
00:05:54,256 --> 00:05:55,256
Paxi's music

127
00:05:55,256 --> 00:05:56,256
Let's start with Kao

128
00:05:56,256 --> 00:05:57,256
Paxi Paxi

129
00:05:57,256 --> 00:06:00,256
Music start!

130
00:06:07,256 --> 00:06:08,256
What is this?

131
00:06:08,256 --> 00:06:09,256
Yasu, you can't do it!

132
00:06:09,256 --> 00:06:11,256
Yasu, you can't do it!

133
00:06:11,256 --> 00:06:12,256
What is this?

134
00:06:12,256 --> 00:06:13,256
What is this?

135
00:06:13,256 --> 00:06:17,256
The people who are watching this
probably find this interesting

136
00:06:20,256 --> 00:06:21,256
Did he make it?

137
00:06:32,256 --> 00:06:34,256
Yasu, you can't do it!

138
00:06:34,256 --> 00:06:36,256
Yua, Yua, Yua.

139
00:06:37,256 --> 00:06:38,256
Can you do it?

140
00:06:39,256 --> 00:06:40,256
I can't do it!

141
00:06:44,256 --> 00:06:45,256
I can't do it!

142
00:06:47,256 --> 00:06:48,256
I can't do it!

143
00:06:49,256 --> 00:06:50,256
I can't do it!

144
00:06:56,256 --> 00:06:58,256
Rinna, you did four!

145
00:07:00,256 --> 00:07:01,256
I can't do it!

146
00:07:01,256 --> 00:07:02,256
I can't do it!

147
00:07:03,256 --> 00:07:04,256
Rinna, you did four!

148
00:07:05,256 --> 00:07:08,256
I don't know why, but they are excited
for 20 minutes.

149
00:07:08,256 --> 00:07:09,256
20 minutes.

150
00:07:09,256 --> 00:07:11,256
Matsuda, you won!

151
00:07:13,896 --> 00:07:14,896
Damn it!

152
00:07:14,896 --> 00:07:16,896
How was it? Did you make your dream come
true?

153
00:07:16,896 --> 00:07:18,896
I did! It was fun!

154
00:07:18,896 --> 00:07:19,896
It was fun!

155
00:07:19,896 --> 00:07:20,896
I want to do it again!

156
00:07:20,896 --> 00:07:21,896
You did this in Guam?

157
00:07:21,896 --> 00:07:24,896
I was next to you and I was like, what
the hell is this?

158
00:07:24,896 --> 00:07:25,896
Shut up!

159
00:07:27,896 --> 00:07:30,896
Next, Kobayashi's dream to come true

160
00:07:30,896 --> 00:07:31,896
He wants to go to a shrine

161
00:07:31,896 --> 00:07:34,768
What the hell is this?

162
00:07:35,768 --> 00:07:37,768
I have a role

163
00:07:40,768 --> 00:07:42,768
Hirota Kashiwagi is the main role

164
00:07:42,768 --> 00:07:44,768
And Riko and I are the supporting roles

165
00:07:44,768 --> 00:07:49,768
Rina-chan and Ayako-chan are the
translating roles

166
00:07:49,768 --> 00:07:51,768
That's good

167
00:07:51,768 --> 00:07:53,768
This is...

168
00:07:53,768 --> 00:07:56,864
To be continued

169
00:07:56,864 --> 00:07:57,864
Why?

170
00:07:57,864 --> 00:07:58,864
Why?

171
00:07:58,864 --> 00:08:00,864
Recently, there are many people who wear
a Tastasu

172
00:08:00,864 --> 00:08:01,864
That's right

173
00:08:01,864 --> 00:08:02,864
It's amazing

174
00:08:02,864 --> 00:08:03,864
It's a Jinja look

175
00:08:03,864 --> 00:08:04,864
Yes

176
00:08:04,864 --> 00:08:05,864
Personally

177
00:08:05,864 --> 00:08:06,864
Personally

178
00:08:06,864 --> 00:08:07,864
Let's go to the end

179
00:08:07,864 --> 00:08:09,864
Everyone, please do it personally

180
00:08:09,864 --> 00:08:10,864
Let's go

181
00:08:10,864 --> 00:08:11,864
The next question is this

182
00:08:12,864 --> 00:08:16,864
I want to wear a costume and give
balloons to children

183
00:08:16,864 --> 00:08:17,864
This is me

184
00:08:17,864 --> 00:08:18,864
Mayama

185
00:08:18,864 --> 00:08:19,864
What is this?

186
00:08:19,864 --> 00:08:21,864
You are an idol, right?

187
00:08:21,864 --> 00:08:24,864
There are many children who admire me

188
00:08:24,864 --> 00:08:30,864
At a handshake party, I heard that I was
admired and loved by children

189
00:08:30,864 --> 00:08:32,864
I thought that they would say that

190
00:08:32,864 --> 00:08:35,864
When I thought that I wanted to make
children smile

191
00:08:35,864 --> 00:08:37,864
What can make me smile the most?

192
00:08:37,864 --> 00:08:38,864
I thought it was a costume

193
00:08:38,864 --> 00:08:39,864
You can't see the face?

194
00:08:39,864 --> 00:08:40,864
I can't see the face

195
00:08:40,864 --> 00:08:43,864
If you wear a costume at a theme park
and give balloons

196
00:08:43,864 --> 00:08:46,864
Children will come to you

197
00:08:46,864 --> 00:08:48,864
How about the director?

198
00:08:48,864 --> 00:08:51,864
Here it is

199
00:08:51,864 --> 00:08:52,864
I did it

200
00:08:52,864 --> 00:08:53,864
Great

201
00:08:54,864 --> 00:08:56,864
Mayama's dream will come true

202
00:08:56,864 --> 00:09:00,864
Immediately change into a costume and
give balloons to the person who does it

203
00:09:01,864 --> 00:09:03,864
It seems that Mayama is ready

204
00:09:03,864 --> 00:09:04,864
Let's call her

205
00:09:04,864 --> 00:09:05,864
I'm looking forward to it

206
00:09:05,864 --> 00:09:06,864
Mayama

207
00:09:06,864 --> 00:09:07,864
She came

208
00:09:08,864 --> 00:09:09,864
Cute

209
00:09:09,864 --> 00:09:10,864
So cute

210
00:09:10,864 --> 00:09:11,864
Super cute

211
00:09:11,864 --> 00:09:12,864
Mayama

212
00:09:12,864 --> 00:09:13,864
Mayama

213
00:09:13,864 --> 00:09:15,864
It's big and heart-shaped

214
00:09:15,864 --> 00:09:19,864
In your dream, you want to give balloons
to children

215
00:09:19,864 --> 00:09:23,864
If you give a lot of balloons to
children, the heart rate will increase

216
00:09:23,864 --> 00:09:26,864
Let's make children smile from one
person

217
00:09:26,864 --> 00:09:27,864
I see

218
00:09:29,864 --> 00:09:33,864
The cute child is waiting down there

219
00:09:33,864 --> 00:09:38,864
Mayama, please give the balloon and make
children smile

220
00:09:38,864 --> 00:09:41,792
Mayama, please be motivated

221
00:09:42,792 --> 00:09:43,792
Thank you

222
00:09:45,792 --> 00:09:49,792
What will happen to Mayama after this?

223
00:09:51,792 --> 00:09:53,792
Mayama's dream

224
00:09:53,792 --> 00:09:56,792
Dress up as a doll and give the balloon
to children

225
00:09:56,792 --> 00:09:57,792
Start

226
00:09:59,792 --> 00:10:00,792
It's coming

227
00:10:00,792 --> 00:10:01,792
What?

228
00:10:01,792 --> 00:10:02,792
It's coming

229
00:10:04,904 --> 00:10:06,904
The child is watching

230
00:10:06,904 --> 00:10:09,904
I think it's a little scary

231
00:10:21,242 --> 00:10:23,242
It's solidified

232
00:10:23,242 --> 00:10:25,242
What is it?

233
00:10:25,242 --> 00:10:27,242
There is something like this

234
00:10:27,242 --> 00:10:29,242
Is the child looking at the way it comes
out?

235
00:10:31,242 --> 00:10:33,242
It's cute

236
00:10:33,242 --> 00:10:35,242
How is it?

237
00:10:35,242 --> 00:10:37,242
I don't know

238
00:10:38,304 --> 00:10:40,304
Are they being cautious?

239
00:10:40,304 --> 00:10:43,304
It's better if one of them go and help

240
00:10:43,304 --> 00:10:44,304
Then Yasumoto

241
00:10:44,304 --> 00:10:46,304
Yasumoto, go and help

242
00:10:46,304 --> 00:10:55,200
Thank you

243
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:59,200
Maybe it's not something that comes out
of the room

244
00:11:00,200 --> 00:11:01,200
It's coming!

245
00:11:02,200 --> 00:11:04,200
Wait, something weird is coming

246
00:11:04,200 --> 00:11:06,200
Oh no! I'm scared!

247
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:13,200
It's talking!

248
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:15,200
It's saying pyon pyon!

249
00:11:20,858 --> 00:11:22,858
Oh, it's a candy!

250
00:11:22,858 --> 00:11:24,858
It's a candy!

251
00:11:24,858 --> 00:11:26,858
Mayama is surprised!

252
00:11:26,858 --> 00:11:28,858
Mayama is surprised!

253
00:11:28,858 --> 00:11:30,858
Let's see the balloon!

254
00:11:30,858 --> 00:11:32,858
The balloon!

255
00:11:32,858 --> 00:11:34,858
There are a lot of children on it!

256
00:11:36,858 --> 00:11:38,858
It's amazing!

257
00:11:38,858 --> 00:11:40,858
It's moving a lot!

258
00:11:44,858 --> 00:11:46,858
It's a candy!

259
00:11:46,858 --> 00:11:48,858
Mayama!

260
00:11:48,858 --> 00:11:49,594
It's amazing!

261
00:11:49,594 --> 00:11:55,594
Yasumoto took Mayama's dream, so it's
over.

262
00:11:55,594 --> 00:11:57,594
Good job.

263
00:11:57,594 --> 00:11:59,594
I'm so disappointed.

264
00:11:59,594 --> 00:12:03,594
Mayama, did your dream come true?

265
00:12:03,594 --> 00:12:05,594
It did.

266
00:12:05,594 --> 00:12:07,594
I don't think so.

267
00:12:07,594 --> 00:12:11,594
Mayama said her dream came true.

268
00:12:11,594 --> 00:12:14,594
Let's see the next dream.

269
00:12:14,594 --> 00:12:16,594
This is it.

270
00:12:16,594 --> 00:12:19,594
I want to do Gorilla World 2.

271
00:12:19,594 --> 00:12:21,594
What is this?

272
00:12:21,594 --> 00:12:23,594
What is Gorilla World?

273
00:12:23,594 --> 00:12:29,594
Gorilla World is a show where 8 members
of Ebichu members go to eat.

274
00:12:29,594 --> 00:12:31,594
There is no manager.

275
00:12:31,594 --> 00:12:35,594
We reserve a restaurant and go together.

276
00:12:35,594 --> 00:12:37,594
You want to do Gorilla World 2.

277
00:12:37,594 --> 00:12:39,594
Please give us a decision.

278
00:12:39,594 --> 00:12:41,594
This is difficult.

279
00:12:41,594 --> 00:12:43,594
Please.

280
00:12:43,594 --> 00:12:45,594
Ebichu.

281
00:12:45,594 --> 00:12:45,722
Please.

282
00:12:45,722 --> 00:12:47,722
No Gorilla!

283
00:12:47,722 --> 00:12:49,722
No Gorilla!

284
00:12:49,722 --> 00:12:51,722
Why is this No Gorilla?

285
00:12:51,722 --> 00:12:53,722
This is a private show.

286
00:12:53,722 --> 00:12:57,722
Please don't use this show.

287
00:12:57,722 --> 00:12:59,722
Huh?

288
00:12:59,722 --> 00:13:01,722
Gorilla!

289
00:13:03,722 --> 00:13:07,722
Hoshina is late and they meet at the
clock tower.

290
00:13:07,722 --> 00:13:10,722
The last is Kashiwagi's dream.

291
00:13:10,722 --> 00:13:13,872
What kind of dream is it?

292
00:13:13,872 --> 00:13:15,872
Here it is!

293
00:13:15,872 --> 00:13:17,872
A hide and seek game!

294
00:13:17,872 --> 00:13:19,872
It's a really big place!

295
00:13:19,872 --> 00:13:20,872
What does it mean?

296
00:13:20,872 --> 00:13:22,872
If it's small, you can find it easily

297
00:13:22,872 --> 00:13:25,872
If there are 8 people, you can find it
easily

298
00:13:25,872 --> 00:13:29,872
So if you play it in a big place, it's
fun

299
00:13:29,872 --> 00:13:31,872
So you want to play it seriously

300
00:13:31,872 --> 00:13:33,872
It looks fun

301
00:13:33,872 --> 00:13:35,872
You might want to play it when you were
a kid

302
00:13:35,872 --> 00:13:37,872
It's a really big place

303
00:13:37,872 --> 00:13:40,872
Please judge

304
00:13:43,904 --> 00:13:46,904
I'm nervous, nervous, nervous

305
00:13:46,904 --> 00:13:47,904
Please

306
00:13:47,904 --> 00:13:51,904
I can see it, I can see it

307
00:13:51,904 --> 00:13:53,904
You shouldn't take it easy there, Chie-
san

308
00:13:53,904 --> 00:13:56,904
I did it!

309
00:13:57,904 --> 00:13:59,904
I can see it from the beginning

310
00:13:59,904 --> 00:14:04,904
At the end, the dream of the Kashiwagi
will come true

311
00:14:06,992 --> 00:14:12,992
The Kashiwagi's dream, a very large
hide-and-seek venue is this 4-story
building

312
00:14:12,992 --> 00:14:16,992
Use all 4 floors and enjoy it to the
fullest

313
00:14:16,992 --> 00:14:24,992
In this building, the Kashiwagi will
become a demon and find the 7 members
who are hidden within the time limit

314
00:14:24,992 --> 00:14:33,992
First, the other 7 members will find a
place to hide to make their dream come
true

315
00:14:36,154 --> 00:14:38,154
What should I do?

316
00:14:39,154 --> 00:14:41,154
What should I do?

317
00:14:41,154 --> 00:14:45,154
Kobayashi is waiting at the door of the
terrace.

318
00:14:45,154 --> 00:14:47,154
What?

319
00:14:48,154 --> 00:14:50,154
Is this place open?

320
00:14:50,154 --> 00:14:52,154
I'll go to the front.

321
00:14:52,154 --> 00:14:55,154
Matsuno is waiting at the wall on the
third floor.

322
00:14:55,154 --> 00:14:56,154
And...

323
00:14:56,154 --> 00:15:00,112
Can I enter?

324
00:15:01,112 --> 00:15:04,112
Hiroto goes to the storage room on the
stairs.

325
00:15:04,112 --> 00:15:08,112
In this way, all the places to hide are
decided.

326
00:15:11,704 --> 00:15:16,704
As you can see, all the places where 7
people are hiding are decided.

327
00:15:17,704 --> 00:15:18,704
I'll do my best.

328
00:15:19,704 --> 00:15:21,704
Let's go. You have 10 minutes.

329
00:15:22,704 --> 00:15:23,704
Start!

330
00:15:26,704 --> 00:15:31,704
Now, the hidden treasure of Kashiwagi,
start!

331
00:15:31,704 --> 00:15:34,704
What? But, well...

332
00:15:34,704 --> 00:15:39,704
First, search the first floor.

333
00:15:41,274 --> 00:15:43,274
I'm going to go to the first floor.

334
00:15:47,274 --> 00:15:48,274
Everyone!

335
00:15:48,274 --> 00:15:49,274
There are many doors.

336
00:15:49,274 --> 00:16:02,274
Where are you?

337
00:16:02,778 --> 00:16:04,778
I'm going to play with the ball.

338
00:16:08,778 --> 00:16:10,778
I passed the ball.

339
00:16:12,778 --> 00:16:14,778
I'm going to play with the ball.

340
00:16:18,778 --> 00:16:20,778
I'm going to play with the ball.

341
00:16:21,778 --> 00:16:23,778
Who is it?

342
00:16:23,778 --> 00:16:25,778
Who is it?

343
00:16:27,400 --> 00:16:28,400
Riko-chan?

344
00:16:28,400 --> 00:16:29,400
Good morning!

345
00:16:29,400 --> 00:16:30,400
I found you!

346
00:16:30,400 --> 00:16:32,400
Riko-chan, look!

347
00:16:32,400 --> 00:16:33,400
I found you!

348
00:16:33,400 --> 00:16:34,400
The first one!

349
00:16:34,400 --> 00:16:36,400
I found the first one!

350
00:16:36,400 --> 00:16:38,400
Riko-chan?

351
00:16:38,400 --> 00:16:39,400
Good morning!

352
00:16:39,400 --> 00:16:40,400
I found you!

353
00:16:40,400 --> 00:16:41,400
Riko-chan, good morning!

354
00:16:43,400 --> 00:16:44,400
This is difficult

355
00:16:44,400 --> 00:16:55,400
Please subscribe to my channel!

356
00:16:56,872 --> 00:16:57,872
Who is it?

357
00:16:58,872 --> 00:16:59,872
Who is it?

358
00:17:00,872 --> 00:17:01,872
Who is it?

359
00:17:02,872 --> 00:17:03,872
I found you!

360
00:17:03,872 --> 00:17:04,872
Matsuno, look!

361
00:17:04,872 --> 00:17:06,872
I was so nervous!

362
00:17:06,872 --> 00:17:07,872
I found you!

363
00:17:07,872 --> 00:17:08,872
I was so nervous!

364
00:17:09,872 --> 00:17:10,872
So, after...

365
00:17:10,872 --> 00:17:14,872
Kashiwagi decided that she was not in
the third floor, so she went to the
fourth floor.

366
00:17:15,872 --> 00:17:18,872
Yasumoto and Kobayashi are on the
terrace.

367
00:17:19,872 --> 00:17:20,872
Is she coming?

368
00:17:20,872 --> 00:17:24,872
She is coming!

369
00:17:25,594 --> 00:17:27,594
Here they come!

370
00:17:30,594 --> 00:17:33,594
Wait, everyone is hiding

371
00:17:39,594 --> 00:17:41,594
What? They are not here?

372
00:17:41,594 --> 00:17:54,594
To be continued

373
00:17:55,066 --> 00:17:57,066
Someone is there! Who is it?

374
00:17:58,066 --> 00:18:01,066
I found Kaho-chan!

375
00:18:01,066 --> 00:18:08,066
I found Kaho-chan!

376
00:18:09,594 --> 00:18:11,594
I found it!

377
00:18:11,594 --> 00:18:13,594
She found it!

378
00:18:15,594 --> 00:18:17,594
I caught a lot

379
00:18:18,594 --> 00:18:21,594
There's someone here!

380
00:18:21,594 --> 00:18:23,594
Who is it?

381
00:18:25,594 --> 00:18:27,594
My legs are numb

382
00:18:28,594 --> 00:18:30,594
There are 3 members left

383
00:18:30,594 --> 00:18:35,056
Can they find it in the time limit?

384
00:18:36,056 --> 00:18:39,056
5 minutes left. Kashiwagi goes to the
first floor again.

385
00:18:40,056 --> 00:18:41,056
Everyone!

386
00:18:42,056 --> 00:18:43,056
3 minutes left.

387
00:18:44,056 --> 00:18:47,056
Time is running out. 4 minutes left.

388
00:18:47,056 --> 00:18:49,056
4 minutes left.

389
00:18:49,056 --> 00:18:51,056
4 minutes left.

390
00:18:52,056 --> 00:18:53,056
I was thinking.

391
00:18:56,056 --> 00:19:01,056
Kashiwagi, without noticing Hoshina
wrapped in cloth, goes through the door.

392
00:19:01,056 --> 00:19:03,056
I was thinking.

393
00:19:03,664 --> 00:19:06,664
To the 3rd floor again.

394
00:19:20,026 --> 00:19:22,026
No one's here

395
00:19:26,026 --> 00:19:28,026
Can I go in here?

396
00:19:33,026 --> 00:19:35,026
Who's there?

397
00:19:35,026 --> 00:19:37,026
I'm scared

398
00:19:37,026 --> 00:19:41,370
To be continued

399
00:19:41,370 --> 00:19:43,370
I was so close to the end

400
00:19:43,370 --> 00:19:45,370
Were you hiding in such a place?

401
00:19:45,370 --> 00:19:47,370
I was so close to the end

402
00:19:47,370 --> 00:19:49,370
Really?

403
00:19:49,370 --> 00:19:51,370
In such a place?

404
00:19:51,370 --> 00:19:53,370
That means

405
00:19:53,370 --> 00:19:55,370
I can't enter this room

406
00:19:55,370 --> 00:19:57,370
It's light

407
00:19:57,370 --> 00:19:59,370
Wait, is he not here?

408
00:19:59,370 --> 00:20:01,370
He's not here

409
00:20:03,370 --> 00:20:05,370
He's not here

410
00:20:05,370 --> 00:20:07,370
I found you!

411
00:20:07,370 --> 00:20:09,370
I found you!

412
00:20:11,642 --> 00:20:13,642
I found the love!

413
00:20:13,642 --> 00:20:15,642
30 seconds is a little cruel!

414
00:20:15,642 --> 00:20:17,642
I tried my best!

415
00:20:17,642 --> 00:20:19,642
Only Hoshina is left.

416
00:20:19,642 --> 00:20:21,642
Will she succeed?

417
00:20:21,642 --> 00:20:23,642
I found the love!

418
00:20:23,642 --> 00:20:25,642
30 seconds is a little cruel!

419
00:20:25,642 --> 00:20:29,642
Please subscribe to my channel!

420
00:20:30,744 --> 00:20:33,744
Where is Miyu-chan hiding?

421
00:20:35,744 --> 00:20:36,744
10 seconds left!

422
00:20:36,744 --> 00:20:37,744
I can't open this, can I?

423
00:20:37,744 --> 00:20:46,744
9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1

424
00:20:46,744 --> 00:20:47,744
Wait, is she gone?

425
00:20:47,744 --> 00:20:48,744
Time's up!

426
00:20:48,744 --> 00:20:49,744
Amazing!

427
00:20:52,744 --> 00:20:57,744
Even though they were able to catch up
to one person, Hoshina was able to
escape and the team that was hiding won!

428
00:20:57,744 --> 00:21:02,744
They lost the game, but they were able
to achieve their dream!

429
00:21:03,744 --> 00:21:06,744
Let's find Hoshina!

430
00:21:07,744 --> 00:21:08,744
It's this floor

431
00:21:08,744 --> 00:21:09,744
Really?

432
00:21:09,744 --> 00:21:10,744
I knew it!

433
00:21:11,744 --> 00:21:12,744
Let's all look for her!

434
00:21:12,744 --> 00:21:14,744
Let's look for her hiding place!

435
00:21:14,744 --> 00:21:19,744
I found her!

436
00:21:22,744 --> 00:21:25,744
It's so bright!

437
00:21:28,744 --> 00:21:30,744
Did you see where she was hiding?

438
00:21:30,744 --> 00:21:31,744
I saw her!

439
00:21:31,744 --> 00:21:36,744
Her clothes were red and she was hiding
in the closet

440
00:21:36,744 --> 00:21:39,744
I didn't even notice she was there

441
00:21:39,744 --> 00:21:40,744
Amazing!

442
00:21:40,744 --> 00:21:41,744
You did well!

443
00:21:41,744 --> 00:21:42,744
I did well!

444
00:21:42,744 --> 00:21:44,744
I can't get out!

445
00:21:51,648 --> 00:22:04,528
And this is a unique event with FRECASO,
a kuno-iksushi-s Lorience harvester.

446
00:22:04,528 --> 00:22:07,768
Please find it hard to guess it!

447
00:22:07,768 --> 00:22:11,768
I want to believe that I can change the
world,

448
00:22:11,768 --> 00:22:16,768
that it's just boring to think about it.

449
00:22:16,768 --> 00:22:21,768
This life that was born

450
00:22:21,768 --> 00:22:25,466
is a dream that can't come true.

451
00:22:25,466 --> 00:22:28,466
It's a miracle

452
00:22:28,466 --> 00:22:32,466
No matter what future we face tomorrow

453
00:22:32,466 --> 00:22:37,466
Let's look at the hope that just
surfaced

454
00:22:37,466 --> 00:22:39,466
Even if it rains, even if it rains

455
00:22:39,466 --> 00:22:42,466
Let's draw a big rainbow

456
00:22:42,466 --> 00:22:46,466
Even if we can't see it

457
00:22:46,466 --> 00:22:51,466
Let's smile with our hearts

458
00:22:52,154 --> 00:22:56,154
And they will show their new song for
the first time!

459
00:23:22,154 --> 00:23:26,154
They will show their new song for the
first time!

460
00:23:31,808 --> 00:23:36,308
Filled with a beautiful color

461
00:23:36,808 --> 00:23:40,808
The dry sky, you're not there anymore

462
00:23:40,808 --> 00:23:44,808
I was smiling at the scent of spring

463
00:23:44,808 --> 00:23:50,808
I was smiling at the scent of spring

464
00:24:02,554 --> 00:24:05,554
The announcement is...

465
00:24:05,554 --> 00:24:18,554
Sakura Ebi's 6th One-Man Live will be
held at Shibuya Duo Music Exchange on
February 19th!

466
00:24:19,034 --> 00:24:23,034
After the live, Sakurai Bees...

467
00:24:23,034 --> 00:24:29,034
After Moa joined, we decided to do it
with 6 people.

468
00:24:29,034 --> 00:24:33,034
We wanted to make 5 people's song into 6
people's version.

469
00:24:33,034 --> 00:24:35,034
We'll do our best together.

470
00:24:35,034 --> 00:24:40,848
Please look forward to the success of
Sakurai Bees this year!

471
00:24:41,848 --> 00:24:46,848
Next time, the winter festival, the
festival of the midwinter, or the
festival of the winter.

472
00:24:47,848 --> 00:24:49,848
Ready, go!

473
00:24:52,848 --> 00:24:54,848
Under the cold sky, a big hustle!

474
00:24:54,848 --> 00:25:10,848
Thank you for watching!

475
00:25:10,970 --> 00:25:12,970
You're fast!

476
00:25:12,970 --> 00:25:14,970
You're fast!

477
00:25:14,970 --> 00:25:16,970
You're fast!
