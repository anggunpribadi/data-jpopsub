Program purpose: Let's add "various things" to the idol group Shiritsu Ebisu Chugaku! Such a throwing experimental program "Ebichu ++ (Tasutasu)" has started! !
Shrimp medium + tissue, shrimp medium + curry, shrimp medium + Indian... Ebichu members collaborated on something and verified the results!
A variety show that unpredictably unfolds every time.
Also, in the program, we will introduce the activities of Ebichu research student "Sakura Ebi-zu"!
In addition, a game project in Shrimp was launched. What will be born from the collaboration between Ebichu and the game? ?

Program details: Tonight's Ebichu++ will present a project called the New Year's special project that will make the dreams of the Ebichu members come true! In this project, we will announce the dreams of the members who have been asked in a questionnaire in advance, and make their dreams come true on the spot. Some of the dreams are too big to come true...Meanwhile, Mayama, the eldest, asks the program to fulfill his dream of "I want to wear a costume and distribute balloons to children." Will Mayama's dream come true? At the end, all the members rent out a house and start a large-scale hide-and-seek game! Whose dream! ? In addition, we will also deliver the state of the one-man live performance of Sakura Ebi ~ which was held on Christmas last year!
