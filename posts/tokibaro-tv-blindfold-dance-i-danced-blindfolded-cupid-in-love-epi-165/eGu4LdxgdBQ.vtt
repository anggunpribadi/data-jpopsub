00:13.792 --> 00:15.792
 Oh!

00:15.792 --> 00:17.792
 We're going to do a hidden camera
dance!

 So, we're going to do a hidden camera
dance with Cupid in Love.

00:27.792 --> 00:33.792
 Last time, we did a hidden camera dance
with Suki.

00:33.792 --> 00:35.792
 It's been a while since we did a hidden
camera dance.

00:35.792 --> 00:40.792
 Yeah, we lost our sense of direction.

00:40.792 --> 00:42.792
 The last pose is the three of us.

00:42.792 --> 00:44.792
 It's quite comfortable.

00:44.792 --> 00:46.792
 Oh, yeah!

00:46.792 --> 00:48.792
 When you like it.

00:48.792 --> 00:50.792
 We're facing each other.

00:51.792 --> 00:54.792
 Let's do our best!

00:54.792 --> 00:56.792
 Let's go!

01:01.792 --> 01:03.792
 If I put it on, I can't move.

01:03.792 --> 01:05.792
 Do you want to put it on at the
beginning?

01:05.792 --> 01:07.792
 Yes, I'll put it on at the beginning.

01:07.792 --> 01:09.792

02:45.568 --> 02:46.568
 Are you ready?

02:46.568 --> 02:47.568
 Yes.

02:48.568 --> 02:49.568

10:03.920 --> 10:05.920
 I'm not sure if I can do it.

10:05.920 --> 10:07.920
 It's a mysterious line.

10:07.920 --> 10:09.920

12:50.128 --> 12:54.288
 I can turn my umbrella around and be at
ease

12:54.288 --> 12:57.988
 If I don't do that, I can't walk

12:57.988 --> 13:00.888
 I'm sure someone is crying somewhere

13:00.888 --> 13:02.888
 I'll get wet again somewhere

13:02.888 --> 13:05.888
 Won't it be cold?

13:05.888 --> 13:08.954
 I'm sure someone is crying somewhere

13:08.954 --> 13:14.954
 I want to share just a little bit of my
feelings with you

13:14.954 --> 13:18.954
 There's still a view I've never seen
before

13:18.954 --> 13:23.954
 So let's go anywhere

13:25.492 --> 13:27.492
 Goodbye, goodbye

 Thank you for yesterday

13:29.492 --> 13:33.652
 The city after the rain is colored

13:33.652 --> 13:35.652
 On the canvas of my damaged heart

13:35.652 --> 13:37.652
 I draw fragments of the future

13:37.652 --> 13:41.152
 and guide the way
