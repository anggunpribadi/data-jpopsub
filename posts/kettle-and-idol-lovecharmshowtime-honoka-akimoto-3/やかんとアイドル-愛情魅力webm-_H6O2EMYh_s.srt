1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,562
Kangeta-chan shouldn't be an oni.

2
00:00:01,562 --> 00:00:02,562
Ha...

3
00:00:03,562 --> 00:00:04,562
Yakan and...

4
00:00:05,562 --> 00:00:07,562
Idol!

5
00:00:09,562 --> 00:00:12,562
Yakan and Idol

6
00:00:14,562 --> 00:00:20,562
I'm sorry, I've cut the first part of
Shonen Manga quite a bit.

7
00:00:20,562 --> 00:00:22,562
I'm sorry, I'm running out of time.

8
00:00:22,562 --> 00:00:25,776
The second one is Ice Cream.

9
00:00:26,776 --> 00:00:28,776
I love ice cream.

10
00:00:29,776 --> 00:00:33,776
I've always had a crush on ice cream.

11
00:00:33,776 --> 00:00:37,776
My family loves ice cream, so I always
put it in the freezer.

12
00:00:38,776 --> 00:00:42,776
I learned how to swim because I thought,

13
00:00:42,776 --> 00:00:44,776
why do I love ice cream so much?

14
00:00:44,776 --> 00:00:46,776
When I was taking a test for swimming,

15
00:00:46,776 --> 00:00:48,776
I saw a picture of SEVENTEEN ice cream

16
00:00:48,776 --> 00:00:51,776
on the wall of the swimming school.

17
00:00:51,776 --> 00:00:52,544
And I regrettedrament that I couldn't
swim.

18
00:00:53,544 --> 00:00:58,544
I think I like ice cream so much because
it is special once a month.

19
00:00:59,544 --> 00:01:05,544
Why is there a swimming school and ice
cream shop in the swimming school?

20
00:01:05,544 --> 00:01:06,544
It's a set.

21
00:01:06,544 --> 00:01:07,544
It's a set.

22
00:01:07,544 --> 00:01:09,232
It's a memory of that.

23
00:01:10,232 --> 00:01:18,232
I think that's where it started. I love
ice cream so much that I'm doing a
personal YouTube channel called Akihito
Honoka's Ice TV.

24
00:01:19,232 --> 00:01:23,232
I'm doing it, and Denny-chan sometimes
watches it.

25
00:01:24,232 --> 00:01:25,232
Really? Takagi-san?

26
00:01:26,232 --> 00:01:28,232
He told me that he saw it.

27
00:01:29,232 --> 00:01:32,232
I'm doing a new ice cream review.

28
00:01:32,232 --> 00:01:40,232
Ice cream is really fast, so every week,
a new convenience store ice cream comes
out.

29
00:01:41,328 --> 00:01:49,328
There are convenience stores that only
sell FAMIMA, SEVEN, LAWSON, and LAWSON's
UCHI CAFE.

30
00:01:49,328 --> 00:01:51,328
There are new products.

31
00:01:51,328 --> 00:01:54,328
There's also SHIROKUMA.

32
00:01:54,328 --> 00:01:59,328
There are many different stores that
sell ice cream.

33
00:01:59,328 --> 00:02:02,328
My favorite is SEVEN's SHIROKUMA.

34
00:02:02,328 --> 00:02:05,136
There's a lot of condensed milk in it.

35
00:02:06,136 --> 00:02:10,136
We have different tastes, so we
introduce them.

36
00:02:10,136 --> 00:02:17,136
The staff agrees with you.

37
00:02:17,136 --> 00:02:20,136
Do you have a favorite?

38
00:02:20,136 --> 00:02:23,136
I don't think there's anyone who doesn't
like ice cream.

39
00:02:23,136 --> 00:02:24,136
I've never heard of it.

40
00:02:24,136 --> 00:02:29,136
I don't think there's anyone who likes
ice cream the most.

41
00:02:29,136 --> 00:02:32,136
I'm sure everyone likes ice cream.

42
00:02:32,136 --> 00:02:33,136
I don't know.

43
00:02:33,584 --> 00:02:35,584
Akagi-san is amazing.

44
00:02:35,584 --> 00:02:39,584
Akagi-san's playfulness is amazing.

45
00:02:39,584 --> 00:02:40,584
Can I say that?

46
00:02:40,584 --> 00:02:47,584
Akagi-san has a great playfulness even
from Garigari-kun.

47
00:02:47,584 --> 00:02:50,584
I think he is a genius of packaging.

48
00:02:50,584 --> 00:02:55,408
Akagi-san is the one who has the most
packaging in a convenience store.

49
00:02:56,408 --> 00:03:03,408
Wait a minute. The Akagi I know is only
Garigari-kun, but that's how many
products there are.

50
00:03:03,408 --> 00:03:09,408
The number of products is changing more
and more, and new ones are increasing.

51
00:03:09,408 --> 00:03:13,408
Have you ever had a chocolate ice cream
with a gorilla statue?

52
00:03:13,408 --> 00:03:20,408
There are a lot of chocolate chips in
vanilla ice cream, and the chocolate
chips are too big and too much.

53
00:03:20,408 --> 00:03:22,560
Everyone knows that I ate it.

54
00:03:23,560 --> 00:03:24,560
I want to eat it.

55
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:27,560
There are a lot of that series.

56
00:03:27,560 --> 00:03:28,560
Chocoza Orizo

57
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:32,560
Yes, there was black tea and bananas.

58
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:39,560
I'm gone, but I love Akagi's ice cream
called Cho-Go-Go-Go.

59
00:03:39,560 --> 00:03:45,560
I've been talking about this all the
time, and I think it'll be resold again.

60
00:03:45,560 --> 00:03:47,560
You should say it.

61
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:51,904
It's called Cho-Go-Go-Go, and it's
amazing.

62
00:03:51,904 --> 00:03:55,444
You bite it, and you get a super hard
chocolate,

63
00:03:55,444 --> 00:03:58,604
then you get a chocolate chip, and then
another chocolate.

64
00:03:58,604 --> 00:04:00,904
It's an ice cream you can enjoy in many
ways.

65
00:04:00,904 --> 00:04:03,804
That's amazing.

66
00:04:03,804 --> 00:04:05,504
The ice cream is delicious.

67
00:04:05,504 --> 00:04:07,104
I was just listening to you.

68
00:04:07,104 --> 00:04:11,304
I'm sorry, but I had a jewelry box ice
cream when I was a kid.

69
00:04:11,304 --> 00:04:12,404
Wow!

70
00:04:12,404 --> 00:04:14,204
Do you know what it is?

71
00:04:14,204 --> 00:04:15,004
Is it similar to mine?

72
00:04:15,004 --> 00:04:16,004
What kind of ice cream is it?

73
00:04:16,004 --> 00:04:20,004
It's like vanilla, but it has ice
jewelry in it.

74
00:04:20,004 --> 00:04:21,952
I still want to eat it.

75
00:04:21,952 --> 00:04:29,952
I was able to synchronize with the
feeling of wanting to meet again someday
and accept your story.

76
00:04:29,952 --> 00:04:31,952
Ice makes people's hearts move.

77
00:04:31,952 --> 00:04:33,952
It moves.

78
00:04:33,952 --> 00:04:41,952
It's amazing that you can think about
why it's different.

79
00:04:41,952 --> 00:04:42,952
I agree.

80
00:04:42,952 --> 00:04:46,952
The fans already know that side of you.

81
00:04:46,952 --> 00:04:50,864
Ice TV also has a lot of things to say.

82
00:04:51,864 --> 00:04:53,864
I heard a good story.

83
00:04:54,864 --> 00:04:55,864
I see.

84
00:04:55,864 --> 00:04:56,864
Thank you.

85
00:04:57,864 --> 00:04:59,864
You should watch Ice TV in detail.

86
00:04:59,864 --> 00:05:01,864
Please watch it.

87
00:05:01,864 --> 00:05:03,864
Please subscribe to the channel.

88
00:05:07,864 --> 00:05:11,864
We were excited to say that we could do
a full marathon.

89
00:05:11,864 --> 00:05:12,864
That's a lie.

90
00:05:12,864 --> 00:05:14,864
We are a group that is carrying a super
tough.

91
00:05:14,864 --> 00:05:20,864
I think it was just right.

92
00:05:22,010 --> 00:05:24,010
This program is...

93
00:05:24,010 --> 00:05:27,010
At Fukubaya-san

94
00:05:28,010 --> 00:05:30,010
Otomo-san

95
00:05:32,010 --> 00:05:35,010
Aisu Daisuki Yuuki-chan-san

96
00:05:36,010 --> 00:05:38,010
Amitaro-san

97
00:05:39,010 --> 00:05:41,010
Kagechi-san

98
00:05:41,010 --> 00:05:44,010
I'm sending you this program

99
00:05:44,010 --> 00:05:50,886
Today's program is 10 times of abs
