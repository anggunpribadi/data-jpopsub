1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
We had a fight.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,000
What did you fight about?

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,000
About this.

4
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:10,000
We didn't tell each other the secret.

5
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:20,720
It

6
00:00:20,720 --> 00:00:25,720
I pretended not to see you

7
00:00:25,720 --> 00:00:28,720
I pretended to understand you

8
00:00:28,720 --> 00:00:30,720
I cried

9
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:32,720
I cried

10
00:00:32,720 --> 00:00:35,720
I'll be the interviewer

11
00:00:35,720 --> 00:00:37,720
Yes, interviewer

12
00:00:37,720 --> 00:00:42,032
First self-introduction

13
00:00:42,032 --> 00:00:45,032
I'm Coco from Gang Parade.

14
00:00:45,032 --> 00:00:47,032
Hello.

15
00:00:47,032 --> 00:00:56,032
I'm listening to the story of Ayano
Toyotoshi and Tsuki Haruna.

16
00:00:56,032 --> 00:01:02,032
I talked about something deep.

17
00:01:02,032 --> 00:01:06,032
I heard that she will be happy even if
she says something bad.

18
00:01:06,032 --> 00:01:08,032
So you should talk about it more deeply.

19
00:01:08,032 --> 00:01:15,032
I was worried about Tsuki and Haruna's
appearance.

20
00:01:15,032 --> 00:01:23,032
I was surprised that they were in the
same group.

21
00:01:23,032 --> 00:01:26,032
I was worried that it would be
interesting.

22
00:01:26,032 --> 00:01:30,032
There were 13 people in the group.

23
00:01:30,032 --> 00:01:34,032
At that time, there were 9 people in the
group.

24
00:01:34,032 --> 00:01:38,032
I was worried about that.

25
00:01:38,032 --> 00:01:41,032
But I was more excited than that.

26
00:01:41,032 --> 00:01:46,032
I think there were people who resisted
the increase in the number of people.

27
00:01:46,032 --> 00:01:49,032
Everyone has an allergic reaction at
first.

28
00:01:49,032 --> 00:01:51,032
But it ended soon.

29
00:01:51,032 --> 00:01:57,032
So I think they were the children who
were wanted.

30
00:01:57,032 --> 00:02:01,032
We were wanted.

31
00:02:01,032 --> 00:02:04,032
I was jealous.

32
00:02:04,032 --> 00:02:07,032
We were only three people.

33
00:02:07,032 --> 00:02:11,032
There were various practice periods
before the show.

34
00:02:11,032 --> 00:02:14,032
Tsuki and Haruna were the two opposite.

35
00:02:14,032 --> 00:02:16,032
I was worried.

36
00:02:16,032 --> 00:02:19,032
Haruna was like a jumping tool.

37
00:02:19,032 --> 00:02:22,032
Tsuki was serious.

38
00:02:22,032 --> 00:02:24,032
I was worried.

39
00:02:24,032 --> 00:02:27,032
After the performance, the movement is
slow.

40
00:02:27,032 --> 00:02:31,032
It's slow and always wrong.

41
00:02:31,032 --> 00:02:35,032
The first practice is over.

42
00:02:35,032 --> 00:02:38,032
I was nervous.

43
00:02:38,032 --> 00:02:41,032
I was nervous.

44
00:02:41,032 --> 00:02:46,032
I was most worried about Haruna's
performance.

45
00:02:46,032 --> 00:02:49,032
I was worried about the performance.

46
00:02:49,032 --> 00:02:54,032
I was worried about the performance.

47
00:02:54,032 --> 00:02:57,032
Tsuki and Haruna were in the group.

48
00:02:57,032 --> 00:03:06,352
The first practice was ZEP Diver.

49
00:03:06,352 --> 00:03:10,932
In the

50
00:03:10,932 --> 00:03:19,732
second practice,ì•™

51
00:03:19,732 --> 00:03:18,192
BIO was

52
00:03:19,712 --> 00:03:22,612
very effective

53
00:03:22,612 --> 00:03:25,152
to meDon't forget

54
00:03:26,352 --> 00:03:26,372
that my

55
00:03:26,372 --> 00:03:28,492
perfection was

56
00:03:28,492 --> 00:03:30,072
very good

57
00:03:30,072 --> 00:03:32,512
while I remember

58
00:03:32,512 --> 00:03:34,012
Heil

59
00:03:34,012 --> 00:03:34,572
Maps

60
00:03:34,572 --> 00:03:37,572
I'm not giving up on this morning

61
00:03:37,572 --> 00:03:39,572
I'm not giving up on this day

62
00:03:39,572 --> 00:03:42,572
I'm going to die, no matter how long

63
00:03:42,572 --> 00:03:44,572
Let's talk about Tiff

64
00:03:44,572 --> 00:03:45,572
P2M 6 consecutive

65
00:03:45,572 --> 00:03:47,572
Yes, it's a timing point

66
00:03:47,572 --> 00:03:48,572
Yes, yes, yes

67
00:03:48,572 --> 00:03:51,572
Maika was in a very bad condition at
that time

68
00:03:51,572 --> 00:03:52,572
I was hot

69
00:03:52,572 --> 00:03:54,572
I was hot, my face was dead

70
00:03:54,572 --> 00:03:57,572
After the end, everyone was crazy in ZEP

71
00:03:57,572 --> 00:03:59,572
Everyone was like

72
00:03:59,572 --> 00:04:00,572
I was like

73
00:04:00,572 --> 00:04:03,572
Maika was down

74
00:04:03,572 --> 00:04:05,572
Really in the hallway

75
00:04:05,572 --> 00:04:07,572
I was like, is it okay?

76
00:04:07,572 --> 00:04:15,572
At that time, the staff who called us at
that time

77
00:04:15,572 --> 00:04:17,572
I happen to be watching that live

78
00:04:17,572 --> 00:04:20,572
Our best performance

79
00:04:20,572 --> 00:04:22,572
I watched it in a crowd

80
00:04:22,572 --> 00:04:24,572
Maika was lying down

81
00:04:24,572 --> 00:04:28,572
We made our major debut

82
00:04:28,572 --> 00:04:31,572
That day was our beginning

83
00:04:31,572 --> 00:04:33,572
At Kawasaki Club Chitta

84
00:04:33,572 --> 00:04:36,572
I played the video and made my major
debut

85
00:04:36,572 --> 00:04:39,572
It wasn't just a major debut
announcement

86
00:04:39,572 --> 00:04:41,572
It's a little bit of a habit

87
00:04:41,572 --> 00:04:43,572
I can't say that

88
00:04:43,572 --> 00:04:45,572
I'm going to say it

89
00:04:45,572 --> 00:04:47,572
It's okay because you don't have to use
it

90
00:04:47,572 --> 00:04:49,572
It's okay

91
00:04:49,572 --> 00:04:51,572
I don't need that at all

92
00:04:51,572 --> 00:04:53,572
I don't need it

93
00:04:53,572 --> 00:04:55,572
I really don't need it

94
00:04:55,572 --> 00:04:33,732
I'm a black

95
00:04:57,572 --> 00:04:59,572
I'll say it including that

96
00:04:59,572 --> 00:05:01,572
What?

97
00:05:01,572 --> 00:05:03,572
I don't need it at all

98
00:05:03,572 --> 00:05:05,572
I don't need it

99
00:05:05,572 --> 00:05:07,572
I really don't need it

100
00:05:07,572 --> 00:05:09,572
I'm okay

101
00:05:09,572 --> 00:05:14,816
There are many things I have to talk
about

102
00:05:14,816 --> 00:05:18,816
Can I talk about the audition for
Narahagi?

103
00:05:18,816 --> 00:05:20,816
Yes, you can talk about it

104
00:05:20,816 --> 00:05:28,816
I was surprised that I had been doing it
with confidence in the job

105
00:05:28,816 --> 00:05:34,816
I didn't pay much attention to Narahagi
in the training camp

106
00:05:34,816 --> 00:05:42,816
There was also a dissolution of the BIS,
so I was conscious of it

107
00:05:42,816 --> 00:05:48,816
I was also affected by the dissolution
of the BIS

108
00:05:48,816 --> 00:05:50,816
I was a classmate

109
00:05:50,816 --> 00:05:54,816
The BIS of the second generation was
very different from the BIS of the third
generation

110
00:05:54,816 --> 00:06:00,816
I had a lot of memories, so I didn't
feel lonely

111
00:06:00,816 --> 00:06:04,816
I had a lot of feelings of inferiority

112
00:06:04,816 --> 00:06:16,816
I was inspired by the dissolution of the
BIS and I realized that I had come this
far

113
00:06:18,608 --> 00:06:20,608
I can't answer

114
00:06:24,608 --> 00:06:26,608
How is it? What level is it?

115
00:06:27,608 --> 00:06:29,608
I'll talk about everything

116
00:06:30,608 --> 00:06:34,608
How can I pull out the story that I
haven't talked about before?

117
00:06:35,608 --> 00:06:36,608
It was a project

118
00:06:37,608 --> 00:06:41,608
If you could make a proper introduction
that reminds you of the episode, I think
you could talk about it at all

119
00:06:41,608 --> 00:06:43,608
There is no such thing at this time

120
00:06:43,608 --> 00:06:45,608
There is a lot of after that

121
00:06:45,608 --> 00:06:48,608
So, Haruno's...

122
00:06:48,608 --> 00:06:50,608
The moon is already bright.

123
00:06:50,608 --> 00:06:51,608
Haruna will quit.

124
00:06:51,608 --> 00:06:53,608
Haruna will quit.

125
00:06:53,608 --> 00:06:54,608
What is this?

126
00:06:54,608 --> 00:07:08,186
Suddenly...

127
00:07:08,186 --> 00:07:13,306
I pretended not to hear you, even though
I could hear you

128
00:07:13,306 --> 00:07:18,186
I pretended to be stupid and gave up

129
00:07:18,186 --> 00:07:21,382
I pretended not to see you
