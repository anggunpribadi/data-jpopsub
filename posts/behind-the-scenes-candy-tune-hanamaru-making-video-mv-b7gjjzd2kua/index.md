Seven-member idol group "CANDY TUNE" The members are Mizuki Kirihara, Rino Fukuyama, Nanako Ogawa, Natsu Minami, Kotomi Tachibana, Shizuka Miyano, and Hian Murakawa.

Debuted on March 14, 2023 from the new project "KAWAIILAB."

Like the group name "CANDY", which has various flavors and shapes, it is hoped that unique members with different likes and personalities will gather and play their pop "TUNE (melody)". Thoughts are included.
