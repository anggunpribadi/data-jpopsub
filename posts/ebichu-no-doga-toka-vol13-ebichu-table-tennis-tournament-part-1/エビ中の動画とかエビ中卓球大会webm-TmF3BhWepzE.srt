9
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:26,760
I'm nervous.

10
00:00:32,760 --> 00:00:33,760
This is difficult.

11
00:00:39,760 --> 00:00:41,760
Which one is better?

12
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:44,760
After the game, Misaki finished quickly.

13
00:00:52,760 --> 00:00:58,760
You should make Ayaka bounce.

14
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:00,760
I can't tell if you are focusing on me.

15
00:01:00,760 --> 00:01:02,100
See you next time!

You're good.

35
00:01:47,168 --> 00:01:49,168
It was like a table tennis.

36
00:01:49,168 --> 00:01:51,168
I couldn't break it.

37
00:01:59,168 --> 00:02:01,168
You can do it.

38
00:02:01,168 --> 00:02:04,666
Thank you for watching.

39
00:02:04,666 --> 00:02:16,346
Wait a minute, even in this challenging
situation if I surpassed you, I wouldn't
have been able to do it.

40
00:02:16,346 --> 00:02:19,746
I wish they have these nuclear combo or
this kind of shape

00:02:58,234 --> 00:03:00,234
It's not a bad thing.

48
00:03:00,234 --> 00:03:02,234
You don't have to take that.

49
00:03:04,234 --> 00:03:06,234

00:03:59,978 --> 00:04:01,258
On another day…

62
00:04:01,258 --> 00:04:02,858
I irritate.

63
00:04:02,858 --> 00:04:05,238
That's confusing.

64
00:04:05,238 --> 00:04:07,378
Are you talking about my serve?

We never receive angry calls from our
viewers.

68
00:04:15,898 --> 00:04:17,578
To be honourable,

69
00:04:17,578 --> 00:04:19,818
she lost a set.

70
00:04:19,818 --> 00:04:22,318

102
00:05:40,912 --> 00:05:44,112
If you're a slow starter, you can't win.

103
00:05:44,112 --> 00:05:46,112
Yes!

104
00:05:46,112 --> 00:05:48,112

00:06:12,112 --> 00:06:14,112
Oh!

118
00:06:14,112 --> 00:06:16,112
I'm scared.

119
00:06:16,112 --> 00:06:18,112
I can't do it.

120
00:06:18,112 --> 00:06:20,112

I am calm!

132
00:06:46,224 --> 00:06:48,224
I will do it with a punch.

133
00:06:52,224 --> 00:06:54,224
Let's do it twice.

134
00:06:54,224 --> 00:06:56,224
OK.

00:07:02,224 --> 00:07:04,224
Punch!

137
00:07:04,224 --> 00:07:06,224
I will do it with a punch.

138
00:07:09,080 --> 00:07:10,080
I made a mistake.

139
00:07:11,080 --> 00:07:13,080
I hit the ball first.

140
00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:15,080
I hit the ball first.

141
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:18,080
I finally hit the ball.

142
00:07:19,080 --> 00:07:20,080
I didn't hit the ball.

143
00:07:21,080 --> 00:07:23,080
I didn't hit the ball.

144
00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:25,080

I'm going to die!

166

212
00:11:17,410 --> 00:11:22,230
Far traditions from the present,

213
00:11:22,230 --> 00:11:23,730
сор actually have many traditional
thoughts too,

214
00:11:23,730 --> 00:11:26,470
and seems the way not to do the
traditional directions is just a tired,

215
00:11:26,470 --> 00:11:30,330
they might feel to do even harder than

216
00:11:31,370 --> 00:11:33,178
Local culture and the point is

217
00:11:33,178 --> 00:11:35,178

223
00:11:40,178 --> 00:11:41,178
Bu

224
00:11:41,178 --> 00:11:42,178
Me

225
00:11:42,178 --> 00:11:44,178

235
00:11:55,322 --> 00:11:57,322
Thank you so much!

236
00:11:57,322 --> 00:11:59,322
Let's see how well they do!

237
00:11:59,322 --> 00:12:01,322
Thank you so much!

238
00:12:01,322 --> 00:12:03,322
Oh!

00:12:13,818 --> 00:12:17,078
Okay, so if I'm not pounding on here
like this.

243
00:12:17,078 --> 00:12:19,078
What's gonna happen?

244
00:12:19,078 --> 00:12:20,538
Go to the next one!

LMAO

246
00:12:29,058 --> 00:12:31,638
MODERN HANDS

247
00:12:31,638 --> 00:12:34,682
So they will regret.
