We will add many things to the private
Ebisu Middle School.

15
00:01:01,050 --> 00:01:04,050
Ebisu Justice!

16
00:01:06,050 --> 00:01:11,050
This program is brought to you by the
sponsor you see.

17
00:01:13,050 --> 00:01:15,050
It's really delicious.

18
00:01:15,050 --> 00:01:21,050
Thank you for watching.

19
00:01:22,202 --> 00:01:23,982
The competition has finally begun.

20
00:01:23,982 --> 00:01:26,482
Ebi-Chu Autumn's Magi Sports Festival.

21
00:01:28,242 --> 00:01:30,542
Here are the members of each team.

22
00:01:32,742 --> 00:01:36,682
Mr. Akiyama, the leader of the Hachioji
Tourism Association, is watching.

23
00:01:37,762 --> 00:01:40,162
Ebi-Chu is divided into the red team and
the white team.

24
00:01:40,162 --> 00:01:42,162
A serious battle is going on.

25
00:01:42,162 --> 00:01:46,162
The red team is ahead of the other team
in the current 87 vs. 53.

26
00:01:46,162 --> 00:01:48,162
Will they be able to escape as it is?

27
00:01:50,162 --> 00:01:54,162
Then, the fourth event, start!

28
00:01:55,162 --> 00:01:57,162
The race is Magi-Takatobi!

29
00:02:00,162 --> 00:02:02,162
Here are the rules of this competition.

30
00:02:02,162 --> 00:02:05,162
Each team will try one by one.

31
00:02:05,162 --> 00:02:08,162
The team with the highest score will be
the winner.

32
00:02:08,162 --> 00:02:12,162
Each team will try one by one.

33
00:02:12,162 --> 00:02:17,162
The race starts from 90cm and will be
eliminated if they fail.

34
00:02:18,162 --> 00:02:23,162
The winner will only get the one who is
in the top 3.

35
00:02:25,162 --> 00:02:28,162
By the way, who jumps the most?

36
00:02:28,162 --> 00:02:30,162
Mayama.

37
00:02:30,162 --> 00:02:33,162
But, this is different from this.

38
00:02:33,162 --> 00:02:35,162
I can see the height.

39
00:02:35,162 --> 00:02:38,162
Mayama is short, so I think it's better
to see her.

40
00:02:38,162 --> 00:02:40,162
She is a pro at the length of her legs.

41
00:02:40,162 --> 00:02:44,162
The one who jumps the most is the one
who has the advantage of the length of
her legs.

42
00:02:44,162 --> 00:02:47,162
Then, Mayama will jump.

43
00:02:47,162 --> 00:02:49,162
She will jump.

44
00:02:49,162 --> 00:02:51,162
It's impossible.

45
00:02:51,162 --> 00:02:53,162
If she jumps, she can go anywhere.

46
00:02:53,162 --> 00:02:55,162
Then, the first round.

47
00:02:55,162 --> 00:02:58,162
The challenge is to jump at 90cm.

48
00:02:58,162 --> 00:03:01,162
The red team starts from Mayama.

49
00:03:01,162 --> 00:03:04,162
Mayama is at 90cm.

50
00:03:04,162 --> 00:03:05,162
Ready.

51
00:03:05,162 --> 00:03:08,162
I'm nervous.

52
00:03:08,162 --> 00:03:10,162
I jump.

53
00:03:10,162 --> 00:03:13,162
Good job.

54
00:03:13,162 --> 00:03:15,162
It was easy.

55
00:03:15,162 --> 00:03:19,162
She jumps and clears the race.

56
00:03:20,162 --> 00:03:23,162
Next is Matsuno Shirogumi.

57
00:03:23,162 --> 00:03:25,162
Then...

58
00:03:25,162 --> 00:03:27,162
She is watching over me.

59
00:03:27,162 --> 00:03:30,162
She is holding the tower.

60
00:03:30,162 --> 00:03:34,162
She pushes Akiyama's back.

61
00:03:34,162 --> 00:03:36,162
Matsuno is at 90cm.

62
00:03:36,162 --> 00:03:38,162
Ready.

63
00:03:42,162 --> 00:03:45,162
I was nervous.

64
00:03:45,162 --> 00:03:48,162
Next is Hirota Akagumi.

65
00:03:48,162 --> 00:03:50,162
Let's go.

66
00:03:50,162 --> 00:03:52,162
Hirota is at 90cm.

67
00:03:52,162 --> 00:03:52,770
She is watching over me.

68
00:03:52,770 --> 00:03:54,770
The first try

69
00:03:56,770 --> 00:03:58,770
She still has some room

70
00:03:58,770 --> 00:04:00,770
She's scared

71
00:04:02,770 --> 00:04:04,770
White team, Hoshina's turn

72
00:04:04,770 --> 00:04:06,770
Ready

73
00:04:06,770 --> 00:04:08,770
Miya-chan, don't worry

74
00:04:08,770 --> 00:04:10,770
She has room

75
00:04:10,770 --> 00:04:12,770
She has room

76
00:04:12,770 --> 00:04:14,770
Her legs are longer

77
00:04:14,770 --> 00:04:16,770
As expected, everyone is dancing

78
00:04:16,770 --> 00:04:18,770
Red team, Kashiwagi's turn

79
00:04:18,770 --> 00:04:20,770
Kashiwagi's turn

80
00:04:20,770 --> 00:04:22,770
Kashiwagi

81
00:04:22,770 --> 00:04:24,770
How good is her jump?

82
00:04:26,770 --> 00:04:28,770
Kashiwagi's 90cm

83
00:04:28,770 --> 00:04:30,770
Ready

84
00:04:32,770 --> 00:04:34,770
How is it?

85
00:04:34,770 --> 00:04:36,770
It was close

86
00:04:38,770 --> 00:04:40,770
That was close

87
00:04:40,770 --> 00:04:42,770
It was so close

88
00:04:42,770 --> 00:04:44,770
It was so close

89
00:04:44,770 --> 00:04:46,770
I didn't know the timing

90
00:04:46,770 --> 00:04:48,770
She corrected it

91
00:04:48,770 --> 00:04:50,770
It was so close

92
00:04:50,770 --> 00:04:52,770
I'm scared

93
00:04:54,770 --> 00:04:56,770
Next, White team's Yasumoto

94
00:04:56,770 --> 00:04:58,770
She's just like the captain

95
00:04:58,770 --> 00:05:00,770
Then

96
00:05:00,770 --> 00:05:02,770
Akiyama is also watching

97
00:05:02,770 --> 00:05:04,770
Then

98
00:05:04,770 --> 00:05:06,770
Yasumoto's 90cm

99
00:05:06,770 --> 00:05:08,770
Ready

100
00:05:12,770 --> 00:05:14,770
I did it

101
00:05:14,770 --> 00:05:16,770
Akiyama is also clapping

102
00:05:16,770 --> 00:05:18,770
Yay

103
00:05:18,770 --> 00:05:20,770
Next, Red team's Kobayashi

104
00:05:22,770 --> 00:05:24,770
Let's go

105
00:05:24,770 --> 00:05:26,770
Kobayashi's 90cm

106
00:05:26,770 --> 00:05:28,770
Ready

107
00:05:28,770 --> 00:05:30,770
How is it?

108
00:05:30,770 --> 00:05:32,770
It's good

109
00:05:32,770 --> 00:05:34,770
She's good at sports

110
00:05:34,770 --> 00:05:36,770
She's good at sports

111
00:05:36,770 --> 00:05:38,770
But I couldn't do my best

112
00:05:38,770 --> 00:05:40,770
You couldn't do your best

113
00:05:40,770 --> 00:05:42,770
Let's do our best today

114
00:05:42,770 --> 00:05:44,770
We still have time

115
00:05:44,770 --> 00:05:46,770
I'm going to die here

116
00:05:46,770 --> 00:05:48,770
I'm going to die here

117
00:05:48,770 --> 00:05:50,770
I want to go here

118
00:05:50,770 --> 00:05:52,770
She left a mysterious comment

119
00:05:52,770 --> 00:05:54,770
Next, Nakayama

120
00:05:54,770 --> 00:05:56,770
Let's go

121
00:05:56,770 --> 00:05:58,770
Nakayama's 90cm

122
00:05:58,770 --> 00:06:00,770
Ready

123
00:06:00,770 --> 00:06:06,266
Next, White team's Yasumoto

124
00:06:06,266 --> 00:06:11,266
The crossing was too fast and the heel
was slightly caught.

125
00:06:11,266 --> 00:06:13,266
Unfortunately.

126
00:06:13,266 --> 00:06:16,266
The first runner of the second round was
eliminated.

127
00:06:16,266 --> 00:06:19,266
It's not a yay.

128
00:06:19,266 --> 00:06:24,266
In the 90cm, one of the white group,
Nakayama, was eliminated.

129
00:06:26,266 --> 00:06:33,266
In the next second round, in the 95cm,
Mayama and Hoshinaga could easily jump
and clear.

130
00:06:33,266 --> 00:06:40,266
Hirota and Yasumoto also managed to
clear.

131
00:06:47,642 --> 00:06:49,642
Next, the red team, Kashiwagi.

132
00:06:49,642 --> 00:06:52,642
Let's go! Kashiwagi's 95cm. Ready!

133
00:06:53,642 --> 00:06:54,642
Good luck!

134
00:06:54,642 --> 00:07:03,194
Go! Why? Why?

135
00:07:03,194 --> 00:07:05,194
You came here without hesitation

136
00:07:05,194 --> 00:07:07,194
I was able to beat her

137
00:07:07,194 --> 00:07:09,194
It was close

138
00:07:09,194 --> 00:07:11,194
It was close

139
00:07:11,194 --> 00:07:13,194
She fell down

140
00:07:13,194 --> 00:07:17,194
In the second round, 95cm, the red team
Kashiwagi fell down

141
00:07:17,194 --> 00:07:21,194
Each team has 3 people left

142
00:07:21,194 --> 00:07:26,194
Next, the third round, 100cm challenge

143
00:07:28,194 --> 00:07:30,194
Let's go

144
00:07:30,194 --> 00:07:34,194
Mayama's 100cm, ready

145
00:07:34,194 --> 00:07:36,194
Go

146
00:07:36,194 --> 00:07:38,194
Mayama's

147
00:07:38,194 --> 00:07:40,194
She did it

148
00:07:40,194 --> 00:07:42,194
Good luck

149
00:07:42,194 --> 00:07:46,194
Mayama and Hoshino still have a chance
to win

150
00:07:46,194 --> 00:07:48,194
They still have a chance

151
00:07:48,194 --> 00:07:52,194
Next, Yasumoto Shirogumi and then

152
00:07:52,194 --> 00:07:54,194
I'll do my best

153
00:07:54,194 --> 00:07:56,194
Akiyama is getting closer

154
00:07:56,194 --> 00:08:00,194
I feel bad

155
00:08:00,194 --> 00:08:02,194
I feel bad

156
00:08:02,194 --> 00:08:05,194
You are not allowed to enter the line

157
00:08:05,194 --> 00:08:07,194
I'm sorry

158
00:08:07,194 --> 00:08:09,194
You are not allowed to enter the line

159
00:08:09,194 --> 00:08:11,194
It's like a barrier

160
00:08:12,194 --> 00:08:14,194
Let's go

161
00:08:14,194 --> 00:08:16,194
Ready

162
00:08:21,194 --> 00:08:22,106
She did it

163
00:08:22,106 --> 00:08:24,106
I'm so happy

164
00:08:26,106 --> 00:08:29,106
Red team, Hirota's challenge

165
00:08:29,106 --> 00:08:30,106
Ready

166
00:08:31,106 --> 00:08:32,106
Go for it

167
00:08:36,106 --> 00:08:38,106
It's important

168
00:08:38,106 --> 00:08:40,106
What's wrong, Hirota?

169
00:08:41,106 --> 00:08:43,106
I can't tell the timing

170
00:08:43,106 --> 00:08:45,106
Good decision

171
00:08:45,106 --> 00:08:46,106
Ready

172
00:08:46,106 --> 00:08:48,106
Go for it

173
00:08:48,106 --> 00:08:52,106
How is it?

174
00:08:52,106 --> 00:08:54,106
Hirota's down

175
00:08:54,106 --> 00:08:56,106
He patted the bar

176
00:08:56,106 --> 00:08:58,106
He patted the bar

177
00:08:58,106 --> 00:09:01,106
I got a sand and went home

178
00:09:01,106 --> 00:09:03,106
It's like a hat

179
00:09:03,106 --> 00:09:06,106
It's like a sportsman's tail

180
00:09:07,106 --> 00:09:10,106
White team, Matsuno's challenge

181
00:09:10,106 --> 00:09:12,106
Ready

182
00:09:12,106 --> 00:09:17,106
Go for it

183
00:09:17,978 --> 00:09:19,978
It's crumbling

184
00:09:19,978 --> 00:09:21,978
It's crumbling

185
00:09:21,978 --> 00:09:23,978
I want to do it again

186
00:09:23,978 --> 00:09:25,978
There is no more time

187
00:09:25,978 --> 00:09:27,978
Please come back

188
00:09:27,978 --> 00:09:29,978
There is no more time

189
00:09:29,978 --> 00:09:31,978
Sorry

190
00:09:31,978 --> 00:09:33,978
It was fun

191
00:09:33,978 --> 00:09:35,978
It was fun

192
00:09:35,978 --> 00:09:39,978
Red team, Kobayashi's challenge

193
00:09:39,978 --> 00:09:41,978
Kobayashi's 100cm

194
00:09:41,978 --> 00:09:43,978
Ready

195
00:09:43,978 --> 00:09:45,978
Wow

196
00:09:45,978 --> 00:09:47,978
I did it

197
00:09:47,978 --> 00:09:49,978
I did it

198
00:09:49,978 --> 00:09:51,978
Yay

199
00:09:51,978 --> 00:09:53,978
Good job

200
00:09:53,978 --> 00:09:55,978
Good job

201
00:09:55,978 --> 00:09:57,978
The 100cm wall is high

202
00:09:57,978 --> 00:10:01,978
Hirota, Kobayashi, Matsuno are
eliminated

203
00:10:01,978 --> 00:10:03,978
The remaining is Red team, Mayama

204
00:10:03,978 --> 00:10:05,978
White team, Yasumoto, Hoshina

205
00:10:05,978 --> 00:10:07,978
The three

206
00:10:07,978 --> 00:10:09,978
From here, the order is a battle

207
00:10:09,978 --> 00:10:11,978
If the White team wins the first and
second place

208
00:10:11,978 --> 00:10:13,978
The chance of turning the table

209
00:10:13,978 --> 00:10:15,978
The fourth round

210
00:10:15,978 --> 00:10:17,978
Challenge 105cm

211
00:10:17,978 --> 00:10:19,978
Let's go

212
00:10:19,978 --> 00:10:21,978
Mayama's 105cm

213
00:10:21,978 --> 00:10:23,978
Ready

214
00:10:23,978 --> 00:10:25,978
Good luck

215
00:10:25,978 --> 00:10:27,978
Wow

216
00:10:27,978 --> 00:10:29,978
Thank you

217
00:10:29,978 --> 00:10:31,978
I will go

218
00:10:31,978 --> 00:10:33,978
Mayama's 105cm

219
00:10:33,978 --> 00:10:35,978
Ready

220
00:10:37,978 --> 00:10:39,978
Wow

221
00:10:39,978 --> 00:10:41,978
Wow

222
00:10:41,978 --> 00:10:43,978
It's amazing

223
00:10:43,978 --> 00:10:45,978
It was close

224
00:10:47,978 --> 00:10:51,978
Next, Yasumoto's 105cm

225
00:10:51,978 --> 00:10:53,978
Good

226
00:10:53,978 --> 00:10:55,978
Yasumoto's 105cm

227
00:10:55,978 --> 00:10:57,978
Ready

228
00:10:59,978 --> 00:11:01,978
Wow

229
00:11:01,978 --> 00:11:07,978
The 105cm wall is not small

230
00:11:07,978 --> 00:11:09,978
Where did you get it?

231
00:11:09,978 --> 00:11:11,978
I got it

232
00:11:11,978 --> 00:11:13,978
Good job

233
00:11:13,978 --> 00:11:15,866
Great

234
00:11:15,866 --> 00:11:21,866
Yasumoto falls and Hoshina tries at the
last shot of the white group

235
00:11:21,866 --> 00:11:26,866
If Hoshina fails here, Mayama will be
the first to decide

236
00:11:26,866 --> 00:11:28,866
150cm, ready

237
00:11:33,866 --> 00:11:35,866
It's easy

238
00:11:37,866 --> 00:11:40,866
Still a clear with a little bit of ease

239
00:11:40,866 --> 00:11:45,866
Mayama and Hoshina's shot

240
00:11:45,866 --> 00:11:48,866
110cm

241
00:11:50,866 --> 00:11:52,866
Are you ready?

242
00:11:52,866 --> 00:11:54,866
Let's go

243
00:11:54,866 --> 00:12:00,866
Will Mayama and Hoshina win?

244
00:12:00,866 --> 00:12:03,866
Mayama's 110cm

245
00:12:03,866 --> 00:12:05,866
Are you ready?

246
00:12:09,866 --> 00:12:11,866
Newly

247
00:12:11,866 --> 00:12:14,866
Red group Mayama's challenge

248
00:12:14,866 --> 00:12:17,866
Mayama's 110cm

249
00:12:17,866 --> 00:12:19,866
Are you ready?

250
00:12:24,866 --> 00:12:26,866
So close

251
00:12:26,866 --> 00:12:28,866
So close

252
00:12:28,866 --> 00:12:29,882
Mayama's 110cm

253
00:12:29,882 --> 00:12:31,382
I was so nervous.

254
00:12:31,542 --> 00:12:33,302
I was nervous too.

255
00:12:33,462 --> 00:12:34,882
Did you miss the timing?

256
00:12:35,042 --> 00:12:36,842
Well...

257
00:12:37,002 --> 00:12:37,802
I fell.

258
00:12:37,962 --> 00:12:39,382
I knew it.

259
00:12:39,562 --> 00:12:41,722
Did you miss the steps?

260
00:12:41,882 --> 00:12:43,522
Well...

261
00:12:43,682 --> 00:12:45,722
I thought my butt was low.

262
00:12:45,882 --> 00:12:47,222
I see.

263
00:12:47,402 --> 00:12:48,642
Your butt?

264
00:12:48,822 --> 00:12:50,902
It's like an athlete.

265
00:12:51,062 --> 00:12:52,562
Like a professional.

266
00:12:52,742 --> 00:12:56,242
But you still can't fly, right?

267
00:12:56,402 --> 00:12:57,902
That's right.

268
00:12:57,902 --> 00:13:00,402
If you can't, you can't fly.

269
00:13:00,562 --> 00:13:03,402
Everyone, let's go!

270
00:13:03,562 --> 00:13:05,202
You can do it!

271
00:13:05,202 --> 00:13:08,378
If you can do it, you're first place.

272
00:13:08,378 --> 00:13:11,378
Let's go! Hoshina's 110cm!

273
00:13:11,378 --> 00:13:12,378
Ready!

274
00:13:16,378 --> 00:13:18,378
It flew!

275
00:13:18,378 --> 00:13:20,378
It flew!

276
00:13:21,378 --> 00:13:24,378
So the winner is Hoshina!

277
00:13:24,378 --> 00:13:29,018
Congratulations!

278
00:13:29,018 --> 00:13:33,218
With a great jump, White Team Hoshina
got first place.

279
00:13:33,218 --> 00:13:35,018
Red Team Mayama got second place.

280
00:13:35,018 --> 00:13:38,018
White Team Yasumoto got third place.

281
00:13:38,018 --> 00:13:40,018
There's still a lot to go.

282
00:13:40,018 --> 00:13:43,018
I'm tired of it. It's getting fun.

283
00:13:43,018 --> 00:13:45,018
Let's ask this person.

284
00:13:45,018 --> 00:13:47,018
Akiyama-san!

285
00:13:47,018 --> 00:13:48,018
Hello!

286
00:13:48,018 --> 00:13:50,018
Can I talk to you for a bit?

287
00:13:50,018 --> 00:13:52,018
Akiyama-san!

288
00:13:52,018 --> 00:13:54,018
Thank you for listening.

289
00:13:54,018 --> 00:14:00,018
Are there any people who are watching
this game and are active?

290
00:14:00,018 --> 00:14:02,018
Yes, there are.

291
00:14:02,018 --> 00:14:04,018
Who are they?

292
00:14:04,018 --> 00:14:06,018
I don't know their names.

293
00:14:06,018 --> 00:14:08,018
I remember them all.

294
00:14:08,018 --> 00:14:10,018
I forgot.

295
00:14:10,018 --> 00:14:12,018
Only Yasumoto remembers them.

296
00:14:12,018 --> 00:14:14,018
Yasumoto!

297
00:14:16,018 --> 00:14:19,018
Amazing! Only Yasumoto remembers them.

298
00:14:19,018 --> 00:14:21,018
My wrist hurts.

299
00:14:22,018 --> 00:14:24,018
You don't do that.

300
00:14:25,018 --> 00:14:27,018
My wrist! My wrist is being grabbed.

301
00:14:30,018 --> 00:14:33,018
With the help of White Team Hoshina and
Yasumoto,

302
00:14:33,018 --> 00:14:37,018
they are only 4 points apart.

303
00:14:37,018 --> 00:14:40,018
The game is heading to the final round.

304
00:14:41,018 --> 00:14:45,018
The final match of the shrimp-chewed
match.

305
00:14:45,018 --> 00:14:49,018
The final match of the shrimp-chewed
match.

306
00:14:49,018 --> 00:14:52,018
Team match, the match relay.

307
00:14:55,018 --> 00:14:58,018
The match relay is 70 meters per person.

308
00:14:58,018 --> 00:15:02,018
Only the anchor runs 100 meters to the
goal.

309
00:15:02,018 --> 00:15:06,018
The winning team gets 100 points.

310
00:15:07,018 --> 00:15:12,018
As a result of the match, each team runs
in this order.

311
00:15:12,018 --> 00:15:17,018
The red team, how did you decide the
order?

312
00:15:17,018 --> 00:15:19,018
The anchor is...

313
00:15:19,018 --> 00:15:24,018
I'm going to run with the yellow team.

314
00:15:24,018 --> 00:15:26,018
I see.

315
00:15:26,018 --> 00:15:28,018
The yellow team is the boss.

316
00:15:28,018 --> 00:15:30,018
Why did the white team decide this
order?

317
00:15:30,018 --> 00:15:32,018
I don't know.

318
00:15:32,018 --> 00:15:36,018
Because Ni-ne is fast, she runs a lot.

319
00:15:36,018 --> 00:15:38,018
I see. What else?

320
00:15:38,018 --> 00:15:42,018
I'm just going to run.

321
00:15:42,018 --> 00:15:43,018
I see.

322
00:15:43,018 --> 00:15:45,018
Good luck.

323
00:15:45,018 --> 00:15:47,018
This is the last match.

324
00:15:47,018 --> 00:15:52,018
The final match, the match relay.

325
00:15:52,018 --> 00:15:54,018
Let's start.

326
00:15:54,018 --> 00:15:56,018
Team match relay.

327
00:15:56,018 --> 00:15:58,018
Ready.

328
00:15:58,018 --> 00:16:02,018
The yellow team is the first to run.

329
00:16:02,018 --> 00:16:06,018
The yellow team is the first to run.

330
00:16:06,018 --> 00:16:08,018
Mayama is fast.

331
00:16:08,018 --> 00:16:10,018
Mayama is fast.

332
00:16:10,018 --> 00:16:12,026
Yasumoto is slow.

333
00:16:12,026 --> 00:16:14,026
Yasumoto is so slow

334
00:16:18,026 --> 00:16:20,026
She's caught up with the speed

335
00:16:22,026 --> 00:16:26,026
Both Kuro and Hayate are leading

336
00:16:27,026 --> 00:16:29,026
She's leading

337
00:16:29,026 --> 00:16:30,026
Go for it!

338
00:16:34,026 --> 00:16:35,026
She's catching up

339
00:16:35,026 --> 00:16:40,922
She's catching up

340
00:16:40,922 --> 00:16:42,922
Hoshina can do it.

341
00:16:43,922 --> 00:16:45,922
Hoshina, from here.

342
00:16:47,922 --> 00:16:49,922
She's fast!

343
00:16:51,922 --> 00:16:53,922
She's going for it!

344
00:16:53,922 --> 00:16:55,922
How is it?

345
00:16:55,922 --> 00:17:00,794
She's going for it!

346
00:17:00,794 --> 00:17:02,794
Wow!

347
00:17:02,794 --> 00:17:04,794
That was close!

348
00:17:04,794 --> 00:17:06,794
That was close!

349
00:17:06,794 --> 00:17:08,794
But the winner is...

350
00:17:08,794 --> 00:17:10,794
Red Team!

351
00:17:12,794 --> 00:17:14,794
You're so close!

352
00:17:14,794 --> 00:17:16,794
Red Team won!

353
00:17:16,794 --> 00:17:18,794
I'm crying!

354
00:17:18,794 --> 00:17:20,794
I'm going!

355
00:17:20,794 --> 00:17:22,794
That was close!

356
00:17:22,794 --> 00:17:24,794
That was amazing!

357
00:17:24,794 --> 00:17:26,794
Red Team won!

358
00:17:26,794 --> 00:17:28,794
Congratulations!

359
00:17:28,794 --> 00:17:30,794
Congratulations!

360
00:17:30,794 --> 00:17:32,794
Congratulations!

361
00:17:32,794 --> 00:17:34,794
At first...

362
00:17:34,794 --> 00:17:36,794
I was so close!

363
00:17:36,794 --> 00:17:38,794
I was so close!

364
00:17:38,794 --> 00:17:40,794
I was so close!

365
00:17:40,794 --> 00:17:42,794
I didn't give up!

366
00:17:42,794 --> 00:17:44,794
I was so close!

367
00:17:44,794 --> 00:17:46,794
I was so close!

368
00:17:46,794 --> 00:17:48,794
I was so close!

369
00:17:48,794 --> 00:17:50,794
I was so close!

370
00:17:50,794 --> 00:17:52,794
You're so strange!

371
00:17:52,794 --> 00:17:54,794
I'm always like this!

372
00:17:54,794 --> 00:17:56,794
You were so close!

373
00:17:56,794 --> 00:17:58,794
I was so close!

374
00:17:58,794 --> 00:18:00,794
You did your best!

375
00:18:00,794 --> 00:18:02,794
That was the plan!

376
00:18:02,794 --> 00:18:04,794
You were going to run away?

377
00:18:04,794 --> 00:18:06,794
Yes!

378
00:18:06,794 --> 00:18:08,794
I see!

379
00:18:08,794 --> 00:18:10,794
I noticed...

380
00:18:10,794 --> 00:18:12,794
I'm not fast!

381
00:18:12,794 --> 00:18:14,794
You're fast!

382
00:18:14,794 --> 00:18:16,794
I'm fast but...

383
00:18:16,794 --> 00:18:18,794
Hoshina was faster!

384
00:18:18,794 --> 00:18:20,794
She's so fast!

385
00:18:20,794 --> 00:18:22,794
She's like a person who can be cheated
on!

386
00:18:22,794 --> 00:18:24,794
She's like a person who can be cheated
on!

387
00:18:24,794 --> 00:18:26,794
She's like a person who can be cheated
on!

388
00:18:26,794 --> 00:18:28,794
She's so small!

389
00:18:28,794 --> 00:18:30,794
If she was 2 meters away...

390
00:18:30,794 --> 00:18:32,794
She would have been cheated on!

391
00:18:32,794 --> 00:18:34,794
I wanted a little more!

392
00:18:34,794 --> 00:18:36,794
I'm glad she wasn't there!

393
00:18:36,794 --> 00:18:38,794
I thought she wouldn't be able to do
that!

394
00:18:38,794 --> 00:18:40,794
I thought she wouldn't be able to do
that!

395
00:18:40,794 --> 00:18:42,794
But she was amazing!

396
00:18:44,794 --> 00:18:46,794
The results are announced!

397
00:18:48,794 --> 00:18:50,794
The total score is...

398
00:18:50,794 --> 00:18:52,794
227 vs 123

399
00:18:52,794 --> 00:18:54,794
The total score is...

400
00:18:54,794 --> 00:18:56,794
227 vs 123

401
00:18:56,794 --> 00:18:58,794
Akagumi won!

402
00:19:04,794 --> 00:19:08,794
The winner will be announced!

403
00:19:08,794 --> 00:19:10,794
The winner's product is...

404
00:19:10,794 --> 00:19:12,794
Autumn Scented Set!

405
00:19:12,794 --> 00:19:14,794
The winner's product is...

406
00:19:14,794 --> 00:19:16,794
Autumn Scented Set!

407
00:19:16,794 --> 00:19:18,794
Wow

408
00:19:20,794 --> 00:19:22,794
Ok, the leader of the red team

409
00:19:22,794 --> 00:19:24,794
Please come forward

410
00:19:24,794 --> 00:19:26,794
I'm the leader

411
00:19:26,794 --> 00:19:28,794
That's right

412
00:19:28,794 --> 00:19:30,794
The leader of the red team

413
00:19:30,794 --> 00:19:32,666
Thank you

414
00:19:32,666 --> 00:19:34,666
You spilled it

415
00:19:34,666 --> 00:19:39,666
It's a little slanted

416
00:19:39,666 --> 00:19:41,666
Don't spill it

417
00:19:41,666 --> 00:19:43,666
Congratulations

418
00:19:46,666 --> 00:19:49,666
Please say a word from the leader of the
red team

419
00:19:49,666 --> 00:19:51,666
Alright

420
00:19:51,666 --> 00:19:53,666
Thank you

421
00:19:53,666 --> 00:19:55,666
Nice

422
00:19:55,666 --> 00:20:01,666
Next, the MVP award for the member who
worked the hardest

423
00:20:01,666 --> 00:20:03,666
This is

424
00:20:03,666 --> 00:20:05,666
Give me a hand

425
00:20:05,666 --> 00:20:09,666
This is from the head of the team,
Chuhei

426
00:20:09,666 --> 00:20:11,666
Thank you

427
00:20:11,666 --> 00:20:15,666
The MVP of this time is

428
00:20:20,666 --> 00:20:22,666
Mirai Hoshina

429
00:20:26,666 --> 00:20:28,666
Congratulations

430
00:20:28,666 --> 00:20:30,666
What's the prize?

431
00:20:30,666 --> 00:20:32,666
This prize is

432
00:20:32,666 --> 00:20:34,666
20,000 yen

433
00:20:34,666 --> 00:20:36,666
Amazing

434
00:20:36,666 --> 00:20:39,666
Let's ask Akiyama to get the prize

435
00:20:39,666 --> 00:20:41,666
Akiyama, sorry

436
00:20:41,666 --> 00:20:44,666
Do you use it recklessly?

437
00:20:44,666 --> 00:20:46,666
It's scary

438
00:20:46,666 --> 00:20:48,666
20,000 yen

439
00:20:48,666 --> 00:20:51,666
It's not going to be a good prize

440
00:20:51,666 --> 00:20:53,666
Look forward

441
00:20:53,666 --> 00:20:55,666
I see

442
00:20:55,666 --> 00:20:57,666
It's not going to be 20,000 yen

443
00:20:57,666 --> 00:21:00,666
What do you think?

444
00:21:00,666 --> 00:21:02,666
I'm happy

445
00:21:02,666 --> 00:21:04,666
20,000 yen

446
00:21:04,666 --> 00:21:06,666
I'll do it

447
00:21:06,666 --> 00:21:08,666
Close your eyes

448
00:21:08,666 --> 00:21:10,666
20,000 yen

449
00:21:10,666 --> 00:21:12,666
20,000 yen

450
00:21:12,666 --> 00:21:15,666
Please open your eyes

451
00:21:15,666 --> 00:21:18,666
Congratulations

452
00:21:18,666 --> 00:21:25,178
30,000 yen is 20,000 yen

453
00:21:25,178 --> 00:21:27,178
Congratulations!

454
00:21:27,178 --> 00:21:28,178
I see!

455
00:21:28,178 --> 00:21:34,178
This mask was bought by Takiue during
the shoot.

456
00:21:34,178 --> 00:21:36,178
Do you want it?

457
00:21:38,178 --> 00:21:44,178
Takiue-sama offered this mask as a gift.

458
00:21:44,178 --> 00:21:46,178
No, I don't want it.

459
00:21:46,178 --> 00:21:48,178
You don't want it?

460
00:21:48,178 --> 00:21:51,178
No way. It's worth 20,000 yen.

461
00:21:51,178 --> 00:21:53,178
Try it on.

462
00:21:53,178 --> 00:21:55,178
I won't sell it.

463
00:21:55,178 --> 00:21:57,178
It's good!

464
00:21:57,178 --> 00:21:59,178
Congratulations!

465
00:21:59,178 --> 00:22:01,178
Congratulations!

466
00:22:01,178 --> 00:22:03,178
It fits you.

467
00:22:03,178 --> 00:22:05,178
It suits you. Congratulations!

468
00:22:05,178 --> 00:22:07,178
I don't want it.

469
00:22:07,178 --> 00:22:09,146
Congratulations!

470
00:22:09,146 --> 00:22:11,146
I think this is it.

471
00:22:11,146 --> 00:22:15,146
Actually, there's one more prize.

472
00:22:15,146 --> 00:22:17,146
What is it?

473
00:22:17,146 --> 00:22:21,146
It's the Akiyama Special Prize that Ms.
Akiyama chose.

474
00:22:24,146 --> 00:22:26,146
It's the prize I wanted the most.

475
00:22:26,146 --> 00:22:29,146
Ms. Akiyama, please announce it.

476
00:22:30,146 --> 00:22:32,146
I'm lost.

477
00:22:32,146 --> 00:22:39,146
I want to give it to everyone.

478
00:22:40,146 --> 00:22:42,146
It's a serious event.

479
00:22:44,146 --> 00:22:49,146
I'm impressed that you all did your
best.

480
00:22:50,146 --> 00:22:53,146
But there's only one person who's still
standing.

481
00:22:53,146 --> 00:22:55,146
There's no one who remembers.

482
00:22:55,146 --> 00:22:58,146
I'm a little confused.

483
00:22:58,146 --> 00:23:00,146
I'm embarrassed.

484
00:23:00,146 --> 00:23:02,146
Let's go.

485
00:23:03,146 --> 00:23:06,146
You all did your best, but you don't
know the name.

486
00:23:06,146 --> 00:23:09,146
I know you all did your best.

487
00:23:09,146 --> 00:23:11,146
Please tell me.

488
00:23:11,146 --> 00:23:16,146
I'll give the prize to Ms. Yasumasa.

489
00:23:16,146 --> 00:23:18,146
Congratulations.

490
00:23:18,146 --> 00:23:20,146
Congratulations.

491
00:23:20,146 --> 00:23:22,146
Congratulations.

492
00:23:22,146 --> 00:23:23,354
Thank you for watching.

493
00:23:23,354 --> 00:23:25,354
It's a high-touch

494
00:23:25,354 --> 00:23:27,354
It's a high-touch

495
00:23:27,354 --> 00:23:29,354
Akiyama Showa

496
00:23:29,354 --> 00:23:31,354
The product is

497
00:23:31,354 --> 00:23:34,354
Akiyama's autograph on this hat

498
00:23:34,354 --> 00:23:36,354
Amazing

499
00:23:36,354 --> 00:23:39,354
Akiyama and Katsuo

500
00:23:39,354 --> 00:23:41,354
Which one should we choose?

501
00:23:41,354 --> 00:23:43,354
Katsuo and Katsuo

502
00:23:43,354 --> 00:23:45,354
Both

503
00:23:45,354 --> 00:23:47,354
Katsuo

504
00:23:47,354 --> 00:23:49,354
Katsuo

505
00:23:49,354 --> 00:23:51,354
Katsuo

506
00:23:51,354 --> 00:23:53,354
How is it?

507
00:23:53,354 --> 00:23:55,354
The kanji is

508
00:23:55,354 --> 00:23:57,354
Katsu and Otoko

509
00:23:57,354 --> 00:23:59,354
Right

510
00:23:59,354 --> 00:24:01,354
I thought so

511
00:24:01,354 --> 00:24:03,354
Thank you

512
00:24:03,354 --> 00:24:05,354
Amazing

513
00:24:05,354 --> 00:24:07,354
Amazing

514
00:24:07,354 --> 00:24:09,354
It suits you

515
00:24:09,354 --> 00:24:11,354
Thank you

516
00:24:11,354 --> 00:24:15,354
Yasumoto, you're not going to join the
citizens' marathon

517
00:24:15,354 --> 00:24:17,354
I'm going to run

518
00:24:17,354 --> 00:24:19,354
Please tell us the date

519
00:24:19,354 --> 00:24:21,354
The date

520
00:24:21,354 --> 00:24:23,354
So

521
00:24:23,354 --> 00:24:25,354
That's it for today

522
00:24:25,354 --> 00:24:27,354
Goodbye

523
00:24:27,354 --> 00:24:29,354
Bye

524
00:24:57,354 --> 00:24:59,354
The new project is

525
00:24:59,354 --> 00:25:01,354
And

526
00:25:01,354 --> 00:25:03,354
The person who missed Ebichu Tastas

527
00:25:03,354 --> 00:25:05,354
The low-grade video distribution site

528
00:25:05,354 --> 00:25:07,354
On the Stardust channel

529
00:25:07,354 --> 00:25:09,354
Ebichu Tastas is being popular

530
00:25:09,354 --> 00:25:11,354
I'm going to buy it

531
00:25:11,354 --> 00:25:13,354
I'm going to buy it

532
00:25:13,354 --> 00:25:15,354
I can't get close to it from here

533
00:25:15,354 --> 00:25:19,354
That machine is free of charge for 400
yen a month

534
00:25:19,354 --> 00:25:21,354
In addition

535
00:25:21,354 --> 00:25:25,354
A lot of exclusive images of unreleased

536
00:25:25,354 --> 00:25:29,354
Search for the details on the Stardust
channel
