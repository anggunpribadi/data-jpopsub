1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Let's start singing the song.

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,000
Let's sing.

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,000
The third day of training.

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,000
Nine girls are struggling with singing.

5
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:18,000
I think they are practicing for the sleep time.

6
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,000
I think it's a little strange.

7
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:27,000
So, the students who have been dancing and singing non-stop,

8
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:30,000
have prepared a special program.

9
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
We have a special teacher.

10
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
Hello, I'm Natsu Nakanishi.

11
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
Nice to meet you.

12
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:43,000
We invite the comedian Natsu Nakanishi to challenge the variety show.

13
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:48,000
The winner is Chiba Ken's high-class strawberry.

14
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
Rin-chan, Rin-chan.

15
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
Rin-chan, you can do it.

16
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Yes, Rin-chan.

17
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
That's right.

18
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:01,000
What is the contents of the box?

19
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:06,000
First, Kashiwagi will show us the example.

20
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
We can see the contents of the box.

21
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
Please open it.

22
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
What is it?

23
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:15,248
The contents of Kashiwagi's box is here.

24
00:01:15,248 --> 00:01:19,248
Wow! This is awesome!

25
00:01:19,514 --> 00:01:21,514
This is...

26
00:01:21,514 --> 00:01:22,514
Suddenly?

27
00:01:22,514 --> 00:01:23,514
Hirata, be careful.

28
00:01:23,514 --> 00:01:25,514
It's dangerous.

29
00:01:25,514 --> 00:01:26,514
What?

30
00:01:26,514 --> 00:01:28,514
What should I do?

31
00:01:28,514 --> 00:01:29,514
If you touch it, it will be a big deal.

32
00:01:29,514 --> 00:01:30,514
It will be a big deal?

33
00:01:30,514 --> 00:01:31,514
It will be.

34
00:01:31,514 --> 00:01:32,514
You have to be careful.

35
00:01:32,514 --> 00:01:33,514
What?

36
00:01:33,514 --> 00:01:35,514
Let's start.

37
00:01:35,514 --> 00:01:38,514
What is inside Kajiwagi's box?

38
00:01:38,514 --> 00:01:39,514
Ready?

39
00:01:39,514 --> 00:01:40,514
How is it?

40
00:01:40,514 --> 00:01:42,514
Wait.

41
00:01:42,514 --> 00:01:43,514
It's dangerous.

42
00:01:43,514 --> 00:01:44,514
It's dangerous.

43
00:01:44,514 --> 00:01:45,514
Be careful.

44
00:01:45,514 --> 00:01:46,514
Cut it.

45
00:01:46,514 --> 00:01:47,514
Oh, no.

46
00:01:47,514 --> 00:01:48,514
Oh, no.

47
00:01:48,514 --> 00:01:49,514
Oh, no.

48
00:01:49,514 --> 00:01:50,514
Oh, no.

49
00:01:50,514 --> 00:01:51,514
Oh, no.

50
00:01:51,514 --> 00:01:52,514
Oh, no.

51
00:01:52,514 --> 00:01:53,514
Oh, no.

52
00:01:53,514 --> 00:01:54,514
It's dangerous.

53
00:01:54,514 --> 00:01:55,514
Are you okay?

54
00:01:55,514 --> 00:01:57,514
Be careful.

55
00:01:57,514 --> 00:01:58,514
Be careful.

56
00:01:58,514 --> 00:01:59,514
Be careful.

57
00:01:59,514 --> 00:02:00,514
Be careful.

58
00:02:00,514 --> 00:02:01,514
If you stimulate it too much...

59
00:02:01,514 --> 00:02:02,514
It's dangerous.

60
00:02:02,514 --> 00:02:03,514
Where is it?

61
00:02:03,514 --> 00:02:04,514
It's dangerous.

62
00:02:04,514 --> 00:02:05,514
Where is it?

63
00:02:05,514 --> 00:02:06,514
A little bit more.

64
00:02:06,514 --> 00:02:07,514
A little bit more.

65
00:02:07,514 --> 00:02:08,514
I'm scared.

66
00:02:08,514 --> 00:02:09,514
No, no.

67
00:02:09,514 --> 00:02:10,514
It's cold.

68
00:02:10,514 --> 00:02:11,514
It's cool.

69
00:02:11,514 --> 00:02:12,514
What is it?

70
00:02:12,514 --> 00:02:13,514
What is it?

71
00:02:13,514 --> 00:02:14,514
It's cool.

72
00:02:14,514 --> 00:02:15,514
It's cool.

73
00:02:15,514 --> 00:02:16,514
It's cool.

74
00:02:16,514 --> 00:02:17,514
Do you have such a feeling?

75
00:02:17,514 --> 00:02:18,514
Is it cool?

76
00:02:18,514 --> 00:02:19,514
Is it cool?

77
00:02:19,514 --> 00:02:20,514
Is it water?

78
00:02:20,514 --> 00:02:21,514
Is there water here?

79
00:02:21,514 --> 00:02:22,514
Is it a water bed?

80
00:02:22,514 --> 00:02:23,514
Is it a water bed?

81
00:02:23,514 --> 00:02:25,514
The answer is a water bed.

82
00:02:25,514 --> 00:02:26,514
It's strange.

83
00:02:26,514 --> 00:02:27,514
Oh, no.

84
00:02:27,514 --> 00:02:28,514
Oh, no.

85
00:02:28,514 --> 00:02:29,514
Be careful.

86
00:02:29,514 --> 00:02:30,514
A little bit more.

87
00:02:30,514 --> 00:02:31,514
A little bit more.

88
00:02:31,514 --> 00:02:32,514
What is it?

89
00:02:32,514 --> 00:02:33,514
What is it?

90
00:02:33,514 --> 00:02:34,514
What is it?

91
00:02:34,514 --> 00:02:35,514
What is it?

92
00:02:35,514 --> 00:02:36,514
What is it?

93
00:02:36,514 --> 00:02:37,514
What is it?

94
00:02:37,514 --> 00:02:38,514
Kajiwagi's box is open.

95
00:02:38,514 --> 00:02:39,514
Be careful.

96
00:02:39,514 --> 00:02:40,514
Be careful.

97
00:02:40,514 --> 00:02:41,514
Be careful.

98
00:02:41,514 --> 00:02:42,514
It's cold.

99
00:02:42,514 --> 00:02:43,514
What is it?

100
00:02:43,514 --> 00:02:44,514
What is it?

101
00:02:44,514 --> 00:02:45,514
What is it?

102
00:02:45,514 --> 00:02:46,514
It's wet.

103
00:02:46,514 --> 00:02:47,514
It's wet.

104
00:02:47,514 --> 00:02:48,514
It's wet.

105
00:02:48,514 --> 00:02:50,514
Kajiwagi, that's good.

106
00:02:50,514 --> 00:02:52,514
You are touching some skin.

107
00:02:52,514 --> 00:02:54,514
You are touching some skin.

108
00:02:54,514 --> 00:02:56,514
I think I should press it harder.

109
00:02:56,514 --> 00:02:58,514
You should press it harder.

110
00:02:58,514 --> 00:03:00,514
I will press it harder.

111
00:03:00,514 --> 00:03:01,514
I will press it harder.

112
00:03:01,514 --> 00:03:02,514
I will press it harder.

113
00:03:02,514 --> 00:03:03,514
I will press it harder.

114
00:03:03,514 --> 00:03:05,514
One, two, three.

115
00:03:05,514 --> 00:03:06,514
What is it?

116
00:03:06,514 --> 00:03:07,514
What is it?

117
00:03:07,514 --> 00:03:13,514
Kajiwagi, did you find out what's in the box?

118
00:03:13,514 --> 00:03:14,514
It's a sea urchin.

119
00:03:16,314 --> 00:03:19,314
That's a pity.

120
00:03:20,314 --> 00:03:21,714
It's not a sea urchin.

121
00:03:21,714 --> 00:03:23,114
The contents of the box are these.

122
00:03:23,614 --> 00:03:25,114
Is this a tail?

123
00:03:25,514 --> 00:03:26,714
Is this a tail?

124
00:03:26,714 --> 00:03:28,714
That's good.

125
00:03:29,514 --> 00:03:32,814
Kashiwagi showed a perfect reaction as a model.

126
00:03:34,614 --> 00:03:37,314
However, when the students challenged...

127
00:03:37,314 --> 00:03:43,216
The contents of Rina's box are these.

128
00:03:43,216 --> 00:03:45,216
It's a little strange.

129
00:03:45,888 --> 00:03:48,888
Let's start! What is the contents of Rina's box?

130
00:03:48,888 --> 00:03:49,888
Ready, start!

131
00:03:50,888 --> 00:03:51,888
Wow!

132
00:03:51,888 --> 00:03:52,888
Wow!

133
00:03:54,888 --> 00:03:55,888
Ebi!

134
00:04:00,888 --> 00:04:01,888
It's a magic!

135
00:04:01,888 --> 00:04:03,888
You have 1 minute to finish.

136
00:04:03,888 --> 00:04:04,888
Are you okay?

137
00:04:05,888 --> 00:04:06,888
Be careful!

138
00:04:06,888 --> 00:04:07,888
Be careful!

139
00:04:11,888 --> 00:04:12,888
It's not this one!

140
00:04:12,888 --> 00:04:13,888
It's not that one!

141
00:04:13,888 --> 00:04:15,888
It's not that one!

142
00:04:15,888 --> 00:04:16,888
What are you touching now?

143
00:04:16,888 --> 00:04:17,888
The wall!

144
00:04:17,888 --> 00:04:18,888
No, not that one!

145
00:04:18,888 --> 00:04:19,888
Not that one!

146
00:04:27,888 --> 00:04:28,888
It has eyes!

147
00:04:28,888 --> 00:04:29,888
It has eyes!

148
00:04:29,888 --> 00:04:30,888
It has mouth!

149
00:04:30,888 --> 00:04:31,888
It has mouth!

150
00:04:32,888 --> 00:04:33,888
It's wet inside.

151
00:04:33,888 --> 00:04:35,888
Why don't you answer me?

152
00:04:37,888 --> 00:04:41,888
She's been giving too many answers that are too free to ignore the sample.

153
00:04:41,888 --> 00:04:45,888
Nakanishi, who has been in the field for 20 years, has been working hard.

154
00:04:45,888 --> 00:04:49,888
But she has been able to have a good time.

155
00:04:50,888 --> 00:04:53,888
I'll give you strawberry Chiba Berry!

156
00:04:53,888 --> 00:04:54,888
Thank you!

157
00:04:55,888 --> 00:04:57,888
I want to eat it!

158
00:04:58,888 --> 00:04:59,888
I have a campaign.

159
00:04:59,888 --> 00:05:03,888
Everyone is having fun, but this is an audition.

160
00:05:04,888 --> 00:05:06,888
I'm going to make you feel the heat today.

161
00:05:06,888 --> 00:05:07,888
Oh, that's right!

162
00:05:07,888 --> 00:05:09,888
This is an audition!

163
00:05:09,888 --> 00:05:14,888
But the students had to decide on a way to be fresh...

164
00:05:21,402 --> 00:05:33,402
The song that was added the day before, Yuwakushitaiya.

165
00:05:33,402 --> 00:05:37,402
To complete it, they practice it in each unit.

166
00:05:41,402 --> 00:05:42,402
It looks fun.

167
00:05:42,402 --> 00:05:45,370
Yuwakushitaiya, the second part is over.

168
00:05:46,290 --> 00:05:47,950
And then..

169
00:05:48,030 --> 00:05:49,830
Nonoka~~

170
00:06:03,674 --> 00:06:05,634
Delivery outside

171
00:06:10,754 --> 00:06:13,674
Rinno chloro

172
00:06:13,734 --> 00:06:24,474
The

173
00:06:26,394 --> 00:06:27,394
Here we go.

174
00:06:27,394 --> 00:06:28,394
And...

175
00:06:28,394 --> 00:06:29,394
Over there.

176
00:06:29,394 --> 00:06:31,394
Akira's place.

177
00:06:31,394 --> 00:06:33,394
This is the center.

178
00:06:33,394 --> 00:06:35,394
This way?

179
00:06:35,394 --> 00:06:38,394
The teacher who drew the line.

180
00:06:38,394 --> 00:06:40,394
Then, let's count.

181
00:06:40,394 --> 00:06:43,394
1, 2, 3.

182
00:06:43,394 --> 00:06:44,394
Thank you.

183
00:06:44,394 --> 00:06:47,394
We have to go to the second floor without turning our hands.

184
00:06:47,394 --> 00:06:49,394
Thank you.

185
00:06:49,394 --> 00:06:56,394
9 students are 없Ur Jian gurus with all the supportive tubes.

186
00:06:57,306 --> 00:07:00,706
I forgot awand에는

187
00:07:05,946 --> 00:07:07,986
Japanese words

188
00:07:07,986 --> 00:07:09,986
Let's do it from the beginning.

189
00:07:28,410 --> 00:07:30,570
Did you see the difference here?

190
00:07:33,930 --> 00:07:36,590
After 3days with these dislike woods...

191
00:07:36,770 --> 00:07:38,470
They shape the units few days before.

192
00:07:38,550 --> 00:07:41,570
As one of the real groups, they make the combined units.

193
00:07:41,570 --> 00:07:42,110
turn back

194
00:07:46,110 --> 00:07:47,610
Okay, so that is enough

195
00:07:47,850 --> 00:07:49,610
now we go to the next stage

196
00:07:50,690 --> 00:07:51,490
come up

197
00:07:54,490 --> 00:07:55,690
that dough is too much

198
00:07:55,866 --> 00:08:02,506
The subject is Denim!

199
00:08:02,506 --> 00:08:08,506
The youngest Mai remembers the dance in one phrase.

200
00:08:21,146 --> 00:08:22,426
N效a

201
00:08:30,554 --> 00:08:31,554
I'm scared.

202
00:08:42,554 --> 00:08:45,554
I like the song when I see the dance.

203
00:08:45,554 --> 00:08:48,554
But when the song starts, it's a big deal.

204
00:08:48,554 --> 00:08:50,554
I'm not scared at all.

205
00:08:53,554 --> 00:08:55,554
I'll practice with Tatsuya.

206
00:08:55,554 --> 00:08:57,554
I'll practice with Tatsuya.

207
00:08:57,554 --> 00:08:59,554
I'll practice with Tatsuya.

208
00:08:59,554 --> 00:09:01,554
I'll practice with Tatsuya.

209
00:09:01,554 --> 00:09:03,554
I have to practice.

210
00:09:03,554 --> 00:09:04,554
It's dangerous.

211
00:09:04,554 --> 00:09:08,256
See you tomorrow.

212
00:09:08,256 --> 00:09:10,256
I can only go to the airport.

213
00:09:11,256 --> 00:09:13,256
I want to go to the airport.

214
00:09:13,256 --> 00:09:15,256
It's a little bit strange.

215
00:09:15,256 --> 00:09:16,256
Yes.

216
00:09:16,256 --> 00:09:18,256
The dance is also strange.

217
00:09:18,256 --> 00:09:20,256
I will practice today.

218
00:09:20,256 --> 00:09:25,456
I will do it with all the energy.

219
00:09:25,456 --> 00:09:29,456
The final screening is at 10pm the next day.

220
00:09:29,456 --> 00:09:32,456
Considering the remaining time, the time to sleep is short.

221
00:09:32,456 --> 00:09:35,456
The final exam is tied with a hard bond.

222
00:09:35,456 --> 00:09:38,456
But the 9 contestants are rivals.

223
00:09:38,456 --> 00:09:43,456
It's cruel, but only the passers-by can become the shrimp-chewers.

224
00:09:45,456 --> 00:09:47,456
The last one is the only one.

225
00:09:47,456 --> 00:09:51,664
It's a battle with yourself.

226
00:09:51,664 --> 00:09:54,664
The final day of training camp.

227
00:09:55,664 --> 00:09:58,664
The unit is shown their performance at 10 o'clock.

228
00:09:59,664 --> 00:10:01,664
The previous actions are free.

229
00:10:01,664 --> 00:10:17,530
The first person to come to the gym at 7 o'clock 52 minutes is...

230
00:10:17,530 --> 00:10:20,530
I couldn't remember the dance at all.

231
00:10:20,530 --> 00:10:23,530
I only did it in the gym class.

232
00:10:26,530 --> 00:10:29,530
Rina had no experience in dancing.

233
00:10:29,530 --> 00:10:34,530
Even when the task was announced, she could only watch the video.

234
00:10:36,530 --> 00:10:40,530
But she showed great growth in this training camp.

235
00:10:40,530 --> 00:10:48,530
The reason is...

236
00:10:48,730 --> 00:10:54,730
I was just fighting

237
00:10:56,730 --> 00:10:59,730
Because she was trying her best to get here

238
00:11:03,730 --> 00:11:05,730
I'm sleepy

239
00:11:05,730 --> 00:11:06,730
I'm sleepy

240
00:11:06,730 --> 00:11:08,730
What are you doing?

241
00:11:08,730 --> 00:11:10,730
I'm flying

242
00:11:10,730 --> 00:11:18,730
I'm tired

243
00:11:18,730 --> 00:11:20,730
I'm tired

244
00:11:20,730 --> 00:11:23,098
Midnight

245
00:11:23,098 --> 00:11:42,064
Even the

246
00:11:42,064 --> 00:11:44,064
These three are...

247
00:11:45,064 --> 00:11:50,064
I want to be like Ebichu and I want to be like her.

248
00:11:50,064 --> 00:11:56,064
I want to be like her and I want to be like her.

249
00:11:56,064 --> 00:12:03,064
I think if I perform with confidence, I can convey it.

250
00:12:03,064 --> 00:12:06,064
I want to be full of confidence.

251
00:12:06,064 --> 00:12:13,064
I want to be like her and I want to be like her.

252
00:12:13,064 --> 00:12:21,248
Today is the last day, so I have to do my best.

253
00:12:21,248 --> 00:12:28,248
I think I will not be able to meet Ebichu.

254
00:12:28,248 --> 00:12:35,386
I was crying that I would not meet Ebichu.

255
00:12:35,386 --> 00:12:38,386
I feel less excited now.

256
00:12:39,386 --> 00:12:46,386
I feel more excited now.

257
00:12:47,386 --> 00:12:50,386
I don't know when the announcement will be.

258
00:12:51,386 --> 00:12:53,386
I'll do my best.

259
00:12:55,386 --> 00:12:58,386
But I can't do it, I can't do it, I can't do it

260
00:12:58,386 --> 00:13:03,066
But I don't want to regret it.

261
00:13:03,066 --> 00:13:06,066
And the Green Salad team?

262
00:13:07,066 --> 00:13:11,066
I'm nervous. I want to make it up to her.

263
00:13:11,066 --> 00:13:13,066
I'm a little worried.

264
00:13:13,066 --> 00:13:18,066
I'm worried about the high notes of the song.

265
00:13:18,066 --> 00:13:23,066
Today is the last day, so I want to be able to show my best.

266
00:13:23,066 --> 00:13:26,066
I want to be able to smile all the time.

267
00:13:26,066 --> 00:13:30,066
I want to be able to perform perfectly.

268
00:13:30,066 --> 00:13:33,066
I woke up at 4am.

269
00:13:33,066 --> 00:13:37,066
But my head is not spinning, so I thought I made a mistake.

270
00:13:37,066 --> 00:13:40,066
I'm worried about the high notes.

271
00:13:40,066 --> 00:13:43,066
I want to be confident and perform well.

272
00:13:43,066 --> 00:13:46,066
I'll do my best.

273
00:13:46,066 --> 00:13:48,066
I have only 7 hours.

274
00:13:48,066 --> 00:13:50,066
I'll do a lot of things.

275
00:13:50,066 --> 00:13:52,066
I'll do this side.

276
00:13:52,066 --> 00:13:54,066
No, I'll do this side.

277
00:13:54,066 --> 00:13:56,066
Thank you.

278
00:13:56,066 --> 00:13:59,066
I'm not doing well.

279
00:14:01,152 --> 00:14:05,152
I want to go to the park.

280
00:14:05,152 --> 00:14:22,010
I'm not doing well. I want to go to the park.

281
00:14:22,010 --> 00:14:27,510
I don't want to reveal my true self

282
00:14:27,510 --> 00:14:33,510
But I want to show that I am real

283
00:14:34,510 --> 00:14:36,510
Then, she came there

284
00:14:37,510 --> 00:14:38,510
Good morning

285
00:14:38,510 --> 00:14:40,510
Yuno came late

286
00:14:40,510 --> 00:14:42,510
I don't know what to do

287
00:14:43,510 --> 00:14:45,510
I...

288
00:14:45,510 --> 00:14:48,896
I don't know what to do

289
00:14:48,896 --> 00:14:50,896
I feel strong

290
00:14:52,688 --> 00:14:54,688
I will do my best

291
00:14:54,688 --> 00:14:55,688
I see

292
00:14:57,688 --> 00:14:59,688
She has no hesitation

293
00:14:59,688 --> 00:15:01,688
She has strong feelings in her heart

294
00:15:01,688 --> 00:15:04,688
I did it until 2pm yesterday

295
00:15:04,688 --> 00:15:08,688
Today I woke up at 6am

296
00:15:08,688 --> 00:15:11,688
I couldn't do the dance I wanted to do

297
00:15:11,688 --> 00:15:14,688
I was thinking about it

298
00:15:14,688 --> 00:15:17,688
I couldn't do this part of the dance

299
00:15:17,688 --> 00:15:22,688
I couldn't do this part after that

300
00:15:22,688 --> 00:15:26,688
I did it many times and I did it fast

301
00:15:26,688 --> 00:15:30,688
I will do my best

302
00:15:30,688 --> 00:15:33,688
I will definitely be in Ebichu

303
00:15:33,688 --> 00:15:36,688
I will go to see everyone

304
00:15:37,688 --> 00:15:39,688
Please
