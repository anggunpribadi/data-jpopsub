1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,000
This week's Ebichu-tastas is the last
week's Ebichu-tasu University

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:13,000
Last time, they aimed to become the
university they wanted to be in and took
the entrance exam for Shiri-tsu Ebisu
University

3
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Shiri-tsu Ebisu University

4
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:17,000
They passed the exam

5
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:19,488
The best of the Ebichu students

6
00:00:19,488 --> 00:00:21,488
The first part of the interview

7
00:00:21,488 --> 00:00:26,488
This time, the university student will
be the one to do the part-time job
interview

8
00:00:26,488 --> 00:00:29,488
The interviewer of the core is in front
of her

9
00:00:29,488 --> 00:00:32,488
Welcome to Happy Cafe

10
00:00:32,488 --> 00:00:35,488
The way she waits is strange

11
00:00:35,488 --> 00:00:37,488
The soloist, Koyama

12
00:00:37,488 --> 00:00:39,488
I don't want to do it anymore

13
00:00:39,488 --> 00:00:41,488
What's wrong, Nakayama?

14
00:00:41,488 --> 00:00:45,488
I don't like the way you're acting

15
00:00:45,488 --> 00:00:49,488
Ebichu Tastas, start!

16
00:01:34,298 --> 00:01:38,298
Add various things to your private Ebisu
junior high school!

17
00:01:38,298 --> 00:01:41,298
Ebisu Justice!

18
00:01:41,298 --> 00:01:44,298
Welcome to Angel Reacts Cafe!

19
00:01:44,298 --> 00:01:47,298
This program is brought to you by these
sponsors.

20
00:01:47,298 --> 00:01:51,888
Please visit us at
www.angelreactscafe.com!

21
00:01:51,888 --> 00:01:53,888
She's awake.

22
00:01:53,888 --> 00:01:56,888
She's fine. She's doing her job well.

23
00:01:57,888 --> 00:02:01,888
Today, we're going to have an interview
with her at her part-time job.

24
00:02:04,888 --> 00:02:07,888
She said she'll be working part-time
when she gets a big discount.

25
00:02:07,888 --> 00:02:09,888
Everyone in Ebichu wants to work part-
time.

26
00:02:09,888 --> 00:02:11,888
I want to try it.

27
00:02:12,888 --> 00:02:14,888
What kind of part-time job do you want
to try?

28
00:02:15,888 --> 00:02:16,888
What about Yasumoto?

29
00:02:17,888 --> 00:02:19,888
A crepe shop or a restaurant?

30
00:02:19,888 --> 00:02:21,888
I want to try it.

31
00:02:21,888 --> 00:02:23,888
I want to try it.

32
00:02:23,888 --> 00:02:24,888
A crepe shop?

33
00:02:24,888 --> 00:02:26,888
I want to try it.

34
00:02:27,888 --> 00:02:30,888
The crepe shop owner is cute, so I want
to try it.

35
00:02:30,888 --> 00:02:33,888
It's also in Harajuku.

36
00:02:34,888 --> 00:02:36,888
The second part is called a secret job.

37
00:02:38,888 --> 00:02:40,888
Why did you try to let her go?

38
00:02:41,888 --> 00:02:43,888
I want to be the one who can get the
most money.

39
00:02:44,888 --> 00:02:45,888
That's right.

40
00:02:45,888 --> 00:02:49,888
That's right.

41
00:02:49,888 --> 00:02:51,888
I can't even think of a secret job.

42
00:02:51,888 --> 00:02:53,888
What kind of secret job do you want?

43
00:02:53,888 --> 00:02:55,888
A secret job that closes the bag.

44
00:02:55,888 --> 00:02:57,888
It's like a secret job.

45
00:02:57,888 --> 00:03:00,888
It's hard to get one for one yen.

46
00:03:00,888 --> 00:03:02,888
One is about 5,000 yen.

47
00:03:02,888 --> 00:03:05,888
I want to try it.

48
00:03:05,888 --> 00:03:06,888
As an experience.

49
00:03:06,888 --> 00:03:08,888
I want to earn money.

50
00:03:08,888 --> 00:03:11,888
If you see this, you'll want to work
part-time.

51
00:03:11,888 --> 00:03:14,888
What about a towel in Ebichu?

52
00:03:14,888 --> 00:03:16,888
That's a good idea.

53
00:03:16,888 --> 00:03:18,888
I don't need a house.

54
00:03:18,888 --> 00:03:20,888
Please do it if you like.

55
00:03:20,888 --> 00:03:22,888
Then the main subject.

56
00:03:22,888 --> 00:03:24,888
Ebichu plus interview.

57
00:03:24,888 --> 00:03:28,464
Challenge the interview of a part-time
job.

58
00:03:28,464 --> 00:03:38,784
Members are divided into four groups and
have a group interview with a part-time
job of a popular girl student.

59
00:03:38,784 --> 00:03:43,264
The waiting is a fake interviewer.

60
00:03:43,264 --> 00:03:48,544
The shooting star in the room secretly
gives instructions.

61
00:03:48,544 --> 00:03:52,800
Let's start the interview with a part-
time job.

62
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:54,800
Here they are.

63
00:03:54,800 --> 00:03:58,800
Yasuno Hoshino, Nakayama Matsuno.

64
00:03:59,800 --> 00:04:01,800
They look quite nervous.

65
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:08,800
Please introduce yourself and promote
yourself.

66
00:04:09,800 --> 00:04:11,800
Please introduce yourself, Ms. Hoshina.

67
00:04:11,800 --> 00:04:14,800
I'm Mirei Hoshina. I'm 17 years old.

68
00:04:14,800 --> 00:04:17,800
I'm always cheerful and smiley.

69
00:04:17,800 --> 00:04:21,800
I think I have the power to cheer up
people around me.

70
00:04:21,800 --> 00:04:23,800
Thank you.

71
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:26,800
She's very confident.

72
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:28,800
Ms. Yasumoto.

73
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:31,800
I'm Ayaka Yasumoto. I'm 16 years old.

74
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:34,800
I'm very shy.

75
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:39,800
But when I started working in a cafe, I
got over it.

76
00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:43,800
I want to be a person who can be active.

77
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:44,800
Thank you.

78
00:04:45,800 --> 00:04:47,800
She's not ready yet.

79
00:04:47,800 --> 00:04:48,800
She's not ready yet.

80
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:49,800
It's an interview.

81
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:52,800
I'm Rina Matsuno. I'm 16 years old.

82
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:55,800
I think I'm cheerful and smiley.

83
00:04:55,800 --> 00:04:56,800
Thank you.

84
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:00,800
I'm Mariko Nakayama. I'm 14 years old.

85
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:03,800
I'm a person who can eat delicious food.

86
00:05:03,800 --> 00:05:11,800
I work hard to make delicious food when
I get a job.

87
00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:13,800
Thank you.

88
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:15,800
She said she was going to eat delicious
food.

89
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:17,800
I thought she was talking about her job.

90
00:05:17,800 --> 00:05:19,800
Please take your seat.

91
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:21,800
Thank you.

92
00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:25,800
If I were the manager, I would have
dropped this clothes when I came here.

93
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:27,800
I would have thought she was joking.

94
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:32,800
Please tell me your shortcomings.

95
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:33,800
Ms. Hoshiga.

96
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:37,800
I have a little bit of a mischievous
side.

97
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:41,800
I learned to fix that part.

98
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:51,800
I learned it at a cafe. I want to be
able to fix it with a calm feeling.

99
00:05:51,800 --> 00:05:54,800
Are you nervous?

100
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:57,800
Are you nervous?

101
00:05:57,800 --> 00:05:58,800
I'm nervous.

102
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:01,800
Are you a little different from usual?

103
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:04,800
I'm a little different.

104
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:07,800
Let's do our best as usual today.

105
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:11,168
Thank you.

106
00:06:11,168 --> 00:06:14,168
Did you ask if she was sleepy?

107
00:06:14,168 --> 00:06:16,168
Is she sleepy?

108
00:06:16,168 --> 00:06:18,168
She is.

109
00:06:18,168 --> 00:06:20,168
I'm often asked this question.

110
00:06:20,168 --> 00:06:23,168
But I'm awake and doing my job.

111
00:06:23,168 --> 00:06:25,168
I see.

112
00:06:25,168 --> 00:06:27,168
Could you tell us the shortcomings?

113
00:06:27,168 --> 00:06:30,168
When I fail,

114
00:06:30,168 --> 00:06:36,168
I immediately start to reflect on
myself.

115
00:06:36,168 --> 00:06:44,168
But I think I can reflect on myself
immediately.

116
00:06:44,168 --> 00:06:46,168
You suddenly talk about shortcomings.

117
00:06:46,168 --> 00:06:49,168
You were talking about shortcomings.

118
00:06:49,168 --> 00:06:58,016
I think I can reflect on myself
immediately.

119
00:06:58,016 --> 00:07:00,016
I'm positive.

120
00:07:00,016 --> 00:07:02,016
That's good.

121
00:07:02,016 --> 00:07:04,016
Let's start with Matsuno-san.

122
00:07:04,016 --> 00:07:10,016
My shortcoming is that I'm too positive
and I'm not good at talking.

123
00:07:10,016 --> 00:07:16,016
This is my first part-time job, so I
want to fix it.

124
00:07:16,016 --> 00:07:22,016
She has only eye power.

125
00:07:22,016 --> 00:07:30,016
Nakayama-san. My shortcoming is that I
can't communicate well with people.

126
00:07:30,016 --> 00:07:39,016
I think that the communication with
customers is important for cafe staff.

127
00:07:39,016 --> 00:07:41,016
I want to do my best.

128
00:07:41,016 --> 00:07:43,016
Are you sleepy?

129
00:07:43,016 --> 00:07:47,016
I'm awake. I'm okay. I'll do my job
properly.

130
00:07:47,016 --> 00:07:55,016
Please think about the store name.

131
00:07:55,016 --> 00:07:57,016
Are you ready?

132
00:07:57,016 --> 00:08:01,536
Please look forward to the next episode.

133
00:08:01,536 --> 00:08:07,536
To show the individuality of the cafe,
we will ask the person who will think
about the cafe's name.

134
00:08:08,536 --> 00:08:10,536
Please show me from Hoshina.

135
00:08:11,536 --> 00:08:14,536
I am Angel Relax Cafe.

136
00:08:15,536 --> 00:08:17,536
What does it mean?

137
00:08:18,536 --> 00:08:24,536
If you can make a guest with a smile
like an angel, you can relax.

138
00:08:24,536 --> 00:08:30,536
If you see someone's smile, you feel
calm and happy.

139
00:08:30,536 --> 00:08:35,952
I named it with that meaning.

140
00:08:35,952 --> 00:08:37,952
Ms Yasumoto, would you like to try?

141
00:08:37,952 --> 00:08:45,248
A little bit.

142
00:08:45,248 --> 00:08:47,248
What is this?

143
00:08:47,248 --> 00:08:51,248
I think a cafe with easy access is good.

144
00:08:51,248 --> 00:08:54,248
I want to drink a little bit of coffee.

145
00:08:54,248 --> 00:08:56,248
I want to drink a little bit of coffee.

146
00:08:56,248 --> 00:08:59,248
I want to make a cafe like that.

147
00:08:59,248 --> 00:09:02,248
Is there a specialty menu?

148
00:09:02,248 --> 00:09:04,248
I want to add a little chocolate.

149
00:09:04,248 --> 00:09:07,248
What is a little chocolate?

150
00:09:07,248 --> 00:09:09,248
I want to add a little chocolate.

151
00:09:09,248 --> 00:09:16,248
I want to add a little chocolate to the
tea.

152
00:09:16,248 --> 00:09:19,248
I'm confused.

153
00:09:19,248 --> 00:09:22,248
Please calm down.

154
00:09:22,248 --> 00:09:24,248
Please calm down.

155
00:09:24,248 --> 00:09:26,248
Please calm down.

156
00:09:26,248 --> 00:09:28,248
I understand.

157
00:09:29,248 --> 00:09:30,248
Matsuno.

158
00:09:30,248 --> 00:09:33,248
I want to open a happy cafe.

159
00:09:33,248 --> 00:09:39,248
I want to make a cafe that people can
drink and eat happily.

160
00:09:39,248 --> 00:09:42,248
I want to open a happy cafe.

161
00:09:42,248 --> 00:09:44,248
Are you happy with your costume?

162
00:09:44,248 --> 00:09:46,248
Are you happy with your costume?

163
00:09:46,248 --> 00:09:48,248
I'm happy.

164
00:09:48,248 --> 00:09:50,248
I'm happy.

165
00:09:50,248 --> 00:09:52,248
I'm happy.

166
00:09:52,248 --> 00:09:55,248
I think it's good.

167
00:09:55,248 --> 00:10:04,248
Nakayama's idea of a cafe is a smile
cafe.

168
00:10:04,248 --> 00:10:08,248
Everyone's answer is ready.

169
00:10:08,248 --> 00:10:14,248
Please tell me your name.

170
00:10:14,248 --> 00:10:15,248
Yes.

171
00:10:15,248 --> 00:10:19,248
He will actually train customers.

172
00:10:19,248 --> 00:10:22,672
First of all, I want to train customers.

173
00:10:22,672 --> 00:10:26,672
Welcome to Angel Relax Cafe.

174
00:10:28,672 --> 00:10:30,672
Thank you.

175
00:10:30,672 --> 00:10:31,672
Yasumoto.

176
00:10:31,672 --> 00:10:32,672
Yes.

177
00:10:34,672 --> 00:10:35,672
I'm going.

178
00:10:36,672 --> 00:10:41,672
Can Yasumoto appeal to the interviewer?

179
00:10:41,672 --> 00:10:50,672
Welcome to Choco Choco Cafe.

180
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:54,800
I can't meet her.

181
00:10:56,800 --> 00:10:58,800
She is so curious.

182
00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:00,800
What is she waiting for?

183
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:04,800
Welcome to Happy Cafe.

184
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:06,800
Welcome to Happy Cafe.

185
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:10,800
I want to make it more festive.

186
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:14,800
I'll do my best.

187
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:16,800
Welcome to Happy Cafe.

188
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:21,984
Happy Cafe is crazy.

189
00:11:21,984 --> 00:11:28,984
That's all for the interview. Thank you
very much.

190
00:11:28,984 --> 00:11:31,984
That's all for the interview. Thank you
very much.

191
00:11:31,984 --> 00:11:33,984
Excuse me.

192
00:11:33,984 --> 00:11:35,984
I want you to appeal to them.

193
00:11:35,984 --> 00:11:37,984
Good luck.

194
00:11:37,984 --> 00:11:38,984
What's wrong?

195
00:11:38,984 --> 00:11:40,984
Excuse me.

196
00:11:40,984 --> 00:11:43,984
Can you show me your ID?

197
00:11:43,984 --> 00:11:45,984
Yes, I'm fine.

198
00:11:45,984 --> 00:11:46,984
Are you sure?

199
00:11:46,984 --> 00:11:47,984
Yes.

200
00:11:47,984 --> 00:11:51,984
Please show me.

201
00:11:52,698 --> 00:11:56,698
Welcome to Smile Cafe

202
00:11:56,698 --> 00:11:59,698
That's all for the interview

203
00:11:59,698 --> 00:12:02,698
Thank you

204
00:12:02,698 --> 00:12:04,698
The interview is over

205
00:12:04,698 --> 00:12:08,698
What will the members say?

206
00:12:08,698 --> 00:12:11,698
Wait a minute, everyone is coming one by
one

207
00:12:11,698 --> 00:12:13,698
I hate it

208
00:12:13,698 --> 00:12:15,698
What happened?

209
00:12:15,698 --> 00:12:17,698
What happened to Nakayama?

210
00:12:17,698 --> 00:12:21,952
I hate it

211
00:12:21,952 --> 00:12:23,952
I hate that guy

212
00:12:23,952 --> 00:12:25,952
I don't want to go to that cafe

213
00:12:25,952 --> 00:12:27,952
What's wrong with you, Nakayama?

214
00:12:27,952 --> 00:12:29,952
I'm still a virgin

215
00:12:29,952 --> 00:12:31,952
I don't want to go to that cafe

216
00:12:31,952 --> 00:12:33,952
What's wrong?

217
00:12:33,952 --> 00:12:42,352
I don't want to go to that cafe

218
00:12:42,352 --> 00:12:49,352
We're going to start another group of
interviews, but the interview has
changed a little.

219
00:12:49,352 --> 00:12:53,352
Yes, it's more powerful than this.

220
00:12:53,352 --> 00:12:54,352
It's scary.

221
00:12:54,352 --> 00:12:57,352
I don't think I'll be the manager of
such a cafe.

222
00:12:57,352 --> 00:13:00,352
Maybe it's like a cafe soul.

223
00:13:00,352 --> 00:13:03,352
I'm doing something in the cafe.

224
00:13:04,352 --> 00:13:07,352
Now, the interview of B group starts.

225
00:13:07,352 --> 00:13:10,352
Excuse me.

226
00:13:10,352 --> 00:13:13,352
I'm sure you're like, is this person?

227
00:13:13,352 --> 00:13:15,352
Then sit down.

228
00:13:15,352 --> 00:13:17,352
Excuse me.

229
00:13:18,352 --> 00:13:23,352
First of all, like A group, if you ask
your own shortcomings.

230
00:13:24,352 --> 00:13:30,352
My shortcomings are that I say what I
think right away.

231
00:13:30,352 --> 00:13:37,352
I say words without thinking, so I
sometimes hurt people.

232
00:13:37,352 --> 00:13:40,352
I try to be careful from time to time.

233
00:13:40,352 --> 00:13:43,352
Then look at me and say what you think.

234
00:13:43,352 --> 00:13:46,352
I thought the skinhead was a good fit.

235
00:13:47,352 --> 00:13:48,352
correct

236
00:13:48,352 --> 00:13:53,776
correct

237
00:13:53,776 --> 00:14:00,776
My shortcomings are that I am not calm
and I am shy

238
00:14:00,776 --> 00:14:03,776
Are you okay with being shy and being a
guest?

239
00:14:03,776 --> 00:14:08,896
But I will do my best

240
00:14:08,896 --> 00:14:10,896
Good

241
00:14:12,896 --> 00:14:16,896
My character is a weak child

242
00:14:16,896 --> 00:14:18,896
When I was a child, I was a strong child

243
00:14:18,896 --> 00:14:20,896
I cry easily

244
00:14:20,896 --> 00:14:22,896
I have a character like that

245
00:14:22,896 --> 00:14:24,896
I can interact with customers

246
00:14:24,896 --> 00:14:26,896
I can interact with customers

247
00:14:26,896 --> 00:14:28,896
I can overcome that

248
00:14:28,896 --> 00:14:30,896
I chose this character

249
00:14:30,896 --> 00:14:32,896
Is it a strong word?

250
00:14:32,896 --> 00:14:34,896
Is it a strong word?

251
00:14:34,896 --> 00:14:39,896
Is it a strong word?

252
00:14:39,896 --> 00:14:41,896
Is it a strong word?

253
00:14:41,896 --> 00:14:43,896
My strong word is

254
00:14:43,896 --> 00:14:45,896
For example

255
00:14:45,896 --> 00:14:47,896
I don't have to do it anymore

256
00:14:47,896 --> 00:14:49,896
I don't have to do it anymore

257
00:14:49,896 --> 00:14:53,896
I have a place I don't like to lose

258
00:14:53,896 --> 00:14:55,896
I have a place I don't like to lose

259
00:14:55,896 --> 00:14:59,896
I think it is easy to be hurt when I
hear the words that break my pride

260
00:14:59,896 --> 00:15:01,896
That's right

261
00:15:01,896 --> 00:15:03,896
Correct

262
00:15:03,896 --> 00:15:05,664
Correct

263
00:15:05,664 --> 00:15:07,664
Hiroto-san's face

264
00:15:09,664 --> 00:15:12,664
My shortcomings are that I'm short-
tempered

265
00:15:13,664 --> 00:15:21,664
I'm not good at acting

266
00:15:21,664 --> 00:15:23,664
What's interesting about Kashiwagi?

267
00:15:24,664 --> 00:15:26,664
You just laughed, right?

268
00:15:26,664 --> 00:15:27,664
What's funny?

269
00:15:27,664 --> 00:15:28,664
Nothing is wrong

270
00:15:28,664 --> 00:15:29,664
Correct

271
00:15:30,664 --> 00:15:31,664
Correct

272
00:15:32,664 --> 00:15:34,664
You keep saying correct

273
00:15:34,664 --> 00:15:36,664
Everyone will laugh at this

274
00:15:36,664 --> 00:15:39,664
Think of the name of this cafe

275
00:15:40,664 --> 00:15:43,664
I'm going to be the manager

276
00:15:44,664 --> 00:15:46,664
I want you to have that image

277
00:15:47,664 --> 00:15:54,664
What kind of name will come up when you
imagine the manager of the skinhead?

278
00:15:54,664 --> 00:15:56,664
Mayama

279
00:15:56,664 --> 00:16:03,664
Yes, I'm the manager of the skinhead

280
00:16:04,664 --> 00:16:08,664
I want to use natural ingredients

281
00:16:08,664 --> 00:16:12,664
And the manager has a nice head

282
00:16:12,664 --> 00:16:16,664
You were pulled to the luxury

283
00:16:17,664 --> 00:16:23,664
Mayama's answer makes the interview more
interesting

284
00:16:23,664 --> 00:16:25,664
Kashiwagi

285
00:16:25,664 --> 00:16:30,624
It's simple, but Tokimeki Cafe

286
00:16:30,624 --> 00:16:33,624
Where is my nuance?

287
00:16:33,624 --> 00:16:34,624
Tokimeki

288
00:16:35,624 --> 00:16:36,624
Tokimeki

289
00:16:37,624 --> 00:16:38,624
Correct

290
00:16:40,624 --> 00:16:41,624
Hirota

291
00:16:42,624 --> 00:16:44,624
How about Uru-Tsuru Tsuru?

292
00:16:44,624 --> 00:16:53,424
I'm screwed

293
00:16:53,424 --> 00:16:55,424
I'm screwed

294
00:16:55,424 --> 00:16:56,424
Thank you

295
00:16:56,424 --> 00:16:57,424
Kobayashi

296
00:16:57,424 --> 00:17:00,424
I'm a cheerful person

297
00:17:00,424 --> 00:17:01,424
You should read the characters

298
00:17:01,424 --> 00:17:03,424
I'm sorry

299
00:17:04,424 --> 00:17:08,424
Next, B team is also training the
customer

300
00:17:09,424 --> 00:17:14,424
What kind of greeting will come out from
this store?

301
00:17:14,424 --> 00:17:16,424
First, from Mayama

302
00:17:16,424 --> 00:17:19,824
Thank you again

303
00:17:19,824 --> 00:17:22,824
Welcome to the Meichan cafe

304
00:17:24,824 --> 00:17:27,824
This is the one

305
00:17:27,824 --> 00:17:29,824
Thank you

306
00:17:29,824 --> 00:17:30,824
Thank you

307
00:17:30,824 --> 00:17:32,824
Kashiwagi

308
00:17:36,824 --> 00:17:40,824
Welcome to Tokimeku Cafe

309
00:17:41,824 --> 00:17:43,824
This is the boss' trick

310
00:17:43,824 --> 00:17:44,824
Do I do that too?

311
00:17:44,824 --> 00:17:48,336
Yes

312
00:17:48,336 --> 00:17:50,336
Can I do it too?

313
00:17:50,336 --> 00:17:52,336
Yes, please

314
00:17:52,336 --> 00:17:54,336
Let's do it together

315
00:17:58,336 --> 00:18:00,336
Welcome

316
00:18:00,336 --> 00:18:02,336
Welcome to Tokimeki Cafe

317
00:18:02,336 --> 00:18:04,336
Welcome

318
00:18:04,336 --> 00:18:06,336
Thank you

319
00:18:06,336 --> 00:18:08,336
Ok, next, Hirota

320
00:18:08,336 --> 00:18:16,336
Welcome to Furutsurutsura

321
00:18:18,544 --> 00:18:19,544
It's pretty good.

322
00:18:19,544 --> 00:18:20,544
OK, let's get started.

323
00:18:20,544 --> 00:18:22,384
Yes.

324
00:18:22,384 --> 00:18:25,884
Welcome to the cheerful and calm cafe.

325
00:18:26,884 --> 00:18:28,504
This is the calm part.

326
00:18:28,504 --> 00:18:30,384
It's calm.

327
00:18:30,384 --> 00:18:33,384
I understand that you're cheerful, but
what does calm mean?

328
00:18:33,804 --> 00:18:35,144
It means you're calm.

329
00:18:35,144 --> 00:18:36,504
You mean my face?

330
00:18:36,504 --> 00:18:38,684
No, I mean your heart.

331
00:18:40,044 --> 00:18:41,384
I'm glad.

332
00:18:41,884 --> 00:18:43,384
Thank you.

333
00:18:45,004 --> 00:18:49,184
Here's an additional question from the
interviewer to Kobayashi.

334
00:18:49,184 --> 00:18:53,184
What kind of food do you want to make in
this cafe?

335
00:18:53,184 --> 00:18:55,184
I want to make dumplings.

336
00:18:55,184 --> 00:18:58,184
Are you saying that to me?

337
00:18:58,184 --> 00:18:59,684
No, I'm not.

338
00:18:59,684 --> 00:19:01,184
Do you like it?

339
00:19:01,184 --> 00:19:02,184
Dumplings.

340
00:19:02,184 --> 00:19:03,184
That's correct.

341
00:19:03,184 --> 00:19:04,184
That's correct.

342
00:19:04,184 --> 00:19:06,184
Thank you.

343
00:19:06,184 --> 00:19:13,728
The interview for the B team is over.

344
00:19:13,728 --> 00:19:17,728
After this, we will announce the
candidates for the interview.

345
00:19:17,728 --> 00:19:21,728
It's Nakayama Gokyu again!

346
00:19:21,728 --> 00:19:26,384
I don't want to remember it.

347
00:19:26,384 --> 00:19:29,384
So, we had a interview with everyone.

348
00:19:29,384 --> 00:19:32,384
We had the A and B teams split into two.

349
00:19:32,384 --> 00:19:41,384
First, we'd like to announce the people
who will be the candidates for the cafe
where the manager is.

350
00:19:41,384 --> 00:19:44,384
By the way, how many people will be the
candidates?

351
00:19:44,384 --> 00:19:45,384
Two people.

352
00:19:47,384 --> 00:19:51,384
Then, please announce the first person.

353
00:19:51,384 --> 00:19:56,384
Who will be the A team?

354
00:19:57,504 --> 00:20:00,504
The first person to be announced is
Hoshina-san!

355
00:20:04,608 --> 00:20:06,608
Why is this?

356
00:20:06,608 --> 00:20:10,608
I think she is great at answering
questions

357
00:20:10,608 --> 00:20:13,608
I think she is great at answering
questions

358
00:20:13,608 --> 00:20:15,608
She laughed

359
00:20:15,608 --> 00:20:17,608
She laughed

360
00:20:17,608 --> 00:20:19,608
She laughed

361
00:20:19,608 --> 00:20:21,608
She laughed

362
00:20:21,608 --> 00:20:23,608
She laughed

363
00:20:23,608 --> 00:20:26,608
Please announce the next person

364
00:20:29,608 --> 00:20:31,608
Nakayama

365
00:20:31,608 --> 00:20:33,608
Congratulations

366
00:20:33,608 --> 00:20:35,608
What happened?

367
00:20:35,608 --> 00:20:37,608
I'm not happy

368
00:20:37,608 --> 00:20:39,608
Why?

369
00:20:39,608 --> 00:20:41,608
I'm happy but I don't want to cry

370
00:20:41,608 --> 00:20:43,608
You were crying

371
00:20:43,608 --> 00:20:45,608
You were crying because you were scared

372
00:20:45,608 --> 00:20:47,608
I was scared

373
00:20:47,608 --> 00:20:49,608
Let's do our best with the manager

374
00:20:49,608 --> 00:20:51,608
With the manager

375
00:20:51,608 --> 00:20:53,608
Why are you crying?

376
00:20:53,608 --> 00:20:57,608
I don't want to remember

377
00:20:57,608 --> 00:20:59,608
Something terrible happened

378
00:20:59,608 --> 00:21:04,608
Next is the manager of B store

379
00:21:04,608 --> 00:21:09,608

Kashiwagi

384
00:21:23,194 --> 00:21:25,194
Why did you choose this?

385
00:21:25,194 --> 00:21:27,194
Tokimeki Cafe

386
00:21:27,194 --> 00:21:29,194
This is it

387
00:21:29,194 --> 00:21:33,194
You said you wanted to be the manager

388
00:21:33,194 --> 00:21:35,194
I was surprised

389
00:21:35,194 --> 00:21:37,194

390
00:21:37,194 --> 00:21:40,194

392
00:21:42,194 --> 00:21:47,194
Why did you choose this?

393
00:21:47,194 --> 00:21:55,194
I chose this because it's a new menu

394
00:21:55,194 --> 00:21:57,194
Cafe with dumplings

395
00:21:57,194 --> 00:22:04,128
Nakayama suddenly exploded

396
00:22:04,128 --> 00:22:08,988
I was left behind at the end, I don't
like it anymore

397
00:22:08,988 --> 00:22:10,888
It's the last one, it's an original

398
00:22:10,888 --> 00:22:13,288
I did it, I said it

399
00:22:13,288 --> 00:22:15,128
You didn't sell it, you didn't sell it

400
00:22:15,128 --> 00:22:18,128
That's what the boss checks

401
00:22:19,128 --> 00:22:24,128
So, if you add a university to Ebichu

402
00:22:24,128 --> 00:22:26,128
I don't like it anymore

403
00:22:26,128 --> 00:22:27,128
What happened?

404
00:22:27,128 --> 00:22:29,128
What happened to Nakayama?

405
00:22:29,128 --> 00:22:32,128
I don't need it anymore, I can't go to
the bank anymore

406
00:22:32,128 --> 00:22:37,128
Nakayama Riko 14 years old, she decided
not to go to the cafe anymore

407
00:22:38,128 --> 00:22:40,128
Sakura Ebi is on the front line

408
00:22:42,128 --> 00:22:45,128
