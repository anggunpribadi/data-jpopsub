Program content: The theme this time is "University", continuing from last week. Speaking of college students, she is a part-time job, so Ebichu members challenged an interview for a part-time job at a cafe. The interviewer is a middle-aged man who feels a little stiff. A member who has never experienced before and is nervous about working as a member of society. The interview takes place in a tense atmosphere. Ebichu members intended to answer seriously, but they keep giving strange answers that don't make sense. And after the interview, Nakayama suddenly cried. What is the reason for the tears!? In addition, we will deliver the latest information about Ebichu research student unit "Sakura Ebi-zu"!
