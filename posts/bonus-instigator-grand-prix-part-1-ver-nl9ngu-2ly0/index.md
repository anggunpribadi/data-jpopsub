This is a wipe video during the VTR of "Nogizaka under construction" 419 "Instigator Grand Prix Part 1". It will be a version in which the instigator members (Sakura Endo, Haruka Kaki, Kazu Inoue) appear more often.

When and what kind of timing did the instigators do the mission? (While I have to watch the VTR, I am struggling not to be found out around me.) 

Please compare with the main story if you like!
* Please enjoy after watching the main story of 419 and 420!
