00:00.000 --> 00:02.000
 I hope the taste of peach is not so
sweet as to say,

00:02.000 --> 00:06.000
 It's sweet, you!

00:11.712 --> 00:13.712

you are.

00:19.712 --> 00:21.712

 This time, I'm in Kourimachi,
Fukushima!

00:55.712 --> 00:57.712
 Thank you for coming today!

00:57.712 --> 00:59.712
 Kourimachi is

00:59.712 --> 01:01.712
 full of fun and

01:01.712 --> 01:03.712
 delicious food.

01:03.712 --> 01:05.712
 Let's go there

01:05.712 --> 01:07.712

01:07.712 --> 01:09.712

 Ready?

01:15.712 --> 01:17.712
 It's Hotapi!

 It's cute!

01:21.712 --> 01:23.712
 It's cute!

01:23.712 --> 01:25.712
 This is a hint of a fun trip.

01:25.712 --> 01:27.712
 Let's think about it and go!

01:27.712 --> 01:29.712
 Let's go to the next place!

01:29.712 --> 01:31.712
 Let's go!

 We are here!

01:37.712 --> 01:39.712
 We are here!

01:39.712 --> 01:41.712
 This is

01:41.712 --> 01:43.712
 a place where

01:43.712 --> 01:45.712
 you can exchange food and brain.

01:45.712 --> 01:47.712
 It's called Kouri in Riga.

01:47.712 --> 01:49.712
 It's called Kouri in Riga.

 Thank you.

02:03.962 --> 02:05.962
 Thank you.

02:05.962 --> 02:07.962
 Then, I used that peach immediately.

02:07.962 --> 02:09.962
 I said it.

02:09.962 --> 02:11.962
 It's nothing.

02:11.962 --> 02:13.962
 It's nothing.

02:13.962 --> 02:15.962
 Let's make a pizza like that.

02:15.962 --> 02:17.962
 I'll make it.

02:17.962 --> 02:19.962
 I'll make it.

02:19.962 --> 02:21.200
 Yeah!

02:22.200 --> 02:25.200

experience from now on.

02:25.200 --> 02:27.200

 Please come in.

02:43.200 --> 02:45.200
 Thank you.

02:45.200 --> 02:48.200
 The lineup looks like this.

02:48.200 --> 02:50.200
 Great!

02:50.200 --> 02:56.200
 Thank you for watching.

02:56.858 --> 03:00.858
 This is the cream box of Fukushima.

03:00.858 --> 03:02.858
 What?

03:02.858 --> 03:03.858
 What?

03:03.858 --> 03:04.858
 It's great.

03:04.858 --> 03:08.858
 It's a dessert pizza.

03:08.858 --> 03:09.858
 I see.

03:11.858 --> 03:14.858
 We are going to make pizza without
eating any snack.

03:14.858 --> 03:15.858
 Yes, of course.

03:18.858 --> 03:21.858
 Have you ever made pizza?

03:21.858 --> 03:22.858
 No.

03:22.858 --> 03:23.858
 I have made pizza once.

03:23.858 --> 03:24.858
 Wow.

03:24.858 --> 03:26.858
 Do you know how to make it?

03:26.858 --> 03:27.858
 No.

03:31.858 --> 03:36.858
 Let's make pizza one by one.

03:36.858 --> 03:37.858
 Yes.

03:37.858 --> 03:39.858
 The name of this pizza is Napoli pizza.

03:39.858 --> 03:40.858
 It emphasizes ears.

03:42.858 --> 03:45.858
 Push the middle part.

03:45.858 --> 03:47.858
 Napoli pizza.

03:50.104 --> 03:52.104
 It's stretching.

03:52.104 --> 03:54.104
 It's going to be torn.

03:54.104 --> 03:56.104
 It's turning.

03:56.104 --> 03:58.104
 Is it turning?

03:58.104 --> 04:00.104
 It's turning.

04:00.104 --> 04:02.104
 I want to see it.

04:07.104 --> 04:09.104
 It's amazing.

04:09.104 --> 04:11.104
 It's perfect.

04:15.104 --> 04:17.104
 Let's go.

04:17.104 --> 04:19.104
 I want to sleep with this.

04:19.104 --> 04:21.104
 It's really fluffy.

04:21.104 --> 04:23.104
 I'm not good at it.

04:23.104 --> 04:25.104
 I'm not good at it.

04:25.104 --> 04:27.104
 I'm not good at it.

04:27.104 --> 04:29.104
 It's difficult.

04:29.104 --> 04:31.104
 Can you turn it?

04:31.104 --> 04:33.104
 I'll try.

04:35.104 --> 04:37.104
 I can smell the incident.

04:37.104 --> 04:39.104
 I'll stop.

04:39.104 --> 04:41.104
 Please edit it.

04:41.104 --> 04:43.104
 It's harder than I thought.

04:43.104 --> 04:45.104
 She is good at it.

04:49.104 --> 04:51.104
 Did you finish?

04:51.104 --> 04:53.104
 I finished.

04:55.112 --> 05:02.112
 I'll give you some points for each part
of your elbow.

05:02.112 --> 05:03.112
 No way!

05:03.112 --> 05:04.112
 You should say it first.

05:05.112 --> 05:07.112
 I'll give you 10 points.

05:09.112 --> 05:10.112
 7 points.

05:13.112 --> 05:14.112

05:21.192 --> 05:23.192

05:24.192 --> 05:26.192
 You have beautiful ears.

05:27.192 --> 05:28.192
 I'm not good at this.

05:29.192 --> 05:31.192
 You have a thin ear.

05:32.192 --> 05:33.192

 We all got the same score.

05:36.192 --> 05:37.192
 We got 23 points.

05:38.192 --> 05:39.192
 You have beautiful ears.

05:40.192 --> 05:41.192
 What are you going to do next?

05:42.192 --> 05:44.192
 I'll prepare the ingredients.

05:44.192 --> 05:46.192
 I'll prepare the ingredients.

05:49.664 --> 05:54.664
 Yeah, I prepared the ingredients.

05:54.664 --> 05:59.664
 I had a spoon there, so thank you.

05:59.664 --> 06:01.664
 Is it okay?

06:01.664 --> 06:05.664
 It's a high-class snack.

06:05.664 --> 06:07.664
 Are you ready for a snack?

06:07.664 --> 06:08.664
 Yes.

06:08.664 --> 06:11.664
 I'm good at it.

06:11.664 --> 06:17.664
 I'll enjoy it.

06:18.202 --> 06:20.202
 Itadakimasu

06:20.202 --> 06:22.202
 It's delicious

06:22.202 --> 06:24.202
 It's sweet

06:24.202 --> 06:26.202
 It's really delicious

06:26.202 --> 06:28.202
 Itadakimasu

06:28.928 --> 06:30.928
 It's so good.

06:30.928 --> 06:32.928
 It's so sweet.

06:32.928 --> 06:36.928
 Now, we have finished tasting the
cream.

06:36.928 --> 06:41.928
 We are going to make 7pizza.

06:41.928 --> 06:43.928
 7pizza.

06:43.928 --> 06:45.928
 7pizza.

06:46.928 --> 06:48.928
 I'll make my pizza.

06:48.928 --> 06:50.928
 It's a pizza.

06:50.928 --> 06:52.928
 It's a sweet mochi.

06:52.928 --> 06:54.928
 What about Miu-gon?

06:54.928 --> 06:56.928
 What should I do with Miu-gon?

06:56.928 --> 06:58.928
 I'll put the ingredients first.

06:58.928 --> 07:00.928
 OK.

07:00.928 --> 07:02.928
 I'll try it.

07:02.928 --> 07:04.928

07:06.928 --> 07:10.928
 I'll put the ingredients on the pizza.

07:11.130 --> 07:13.130
 I'm curious about the peach.

07:14.130 --> 07:16.130
 Peach and cream box.

07:21.130 --> 07:23.130
 I'll put the peach on it.

07:25.130 --> 07:27.130
 I want to make a face here.

07:28.130 --> 07:29.130
 You're making a face.

07:32.130 --> 07:34.130
 I can't find the peach.

07:34.130 --> 07:38.130
 I'm sorry.

07:40.130 --> 07:41.130
 Thank you.

07:43.130 --> 07:45.130

 It's good.

08:03.754 --> 08:05.754
 Wait.

08:05.754 --> 08:07.754
 You can't eat it.

08:07.754 --> 08:09.754
 I put this on the pizza.

08:09.754 --> 08:11.754
 It's done.

08:11.754 --> 08:13.754
 Wow.

 It's done.

08:17.754 --> 08:19.754
 It's done.

08:19.754 --> 08:21.754
 We just need to bake it.

08:21.754 --> 08:23.754
 Do you have a name for the pizza?

08:23.754 --> 08:25.754
 Wait a minute.

09:18.634 --> 09:20.634
 Let's go to the grill.

09:20.634 --> 09:22.634
 I'll make it into a small plate.

09:22.634 --> 09:24.634
 Small plate.

09:24.634 --> 09:26.634
 It's a cherry.

09:26.634 --> 09:28.634
 No one is watching.

09:30.634 --> 09:32.634
 Wow.

09:32.634 --> 09:34.634

 The peach is amazing!

10:46.152 --> 10:48.152
 It's so good!

10:48.152 --> 10:50.152
 It's like eating the peach itself.

10:50.152 --> 10:51.152
 It's so good.

10:51.152 --> 10:53.152
 It's the size of a human.

10:54.152 --> 10:56.152
 It's finally time to eat Takeru-kun.

10:56.152 --> 11:04.378
 I'm going to eat Takeru-kun's eyes.

 How is it?

11:23.152 --> 11:27.152
 It's refreshing and good.

11:29.152 --> 11:31.152
 The dough is well seasoned.

11:31.152 --> 11:37.152
 So, it's different from the usual pizza
with ketchup and bacon.

11:37.152 --> 11:39.152
 It's the best.

11:39.152 --> 11:41.152
 This is really good.

11:41.152 --> 11:48.152
 It's not sweet, but the cherry jam and
peach are refreshing.

11:48.152 --> 11:50.152
 So, it's light.

11:50.152 --> 11:52.152
 But, it's good.

11:52.152 --> 11:54.152
 It looks so good.

11:54.152 --> 11:56.152
 It's the best.

11:56.152 --> 11:58.152
 I'm so happy.

11:58.152 --> 11:59.152
 Thank you.

11:59.152 --> 12:03.152
 It's good to make it and eat it by
yourself.

12:03.152 --> 12:05.152
 It's a love-hate relationship.

12:05.152 --> 12:07.152
 You can try making pizza.

12:07.152 --> 12:09.152
 Please try it.

12:09.152 --> 12:11.152
 I've been waiting for this.

12:11.152 --> 12:13.152
 It's a new menu.

12:13.152 --> 12:15.152
 It looks good.

12:15.152 --> 12:17.152
 It's made by a professional pizza
maker.

12:17.152 --> 12:19.152
 Let's eat professional pizza together.

12:19.152 --> 12:20.152
 I'm so happy.

12:20.152 --> 12:22.152
 Let's eat pizza.

12:22.152 --> 12:27.482
 Please subscribe to this channel.

12:28.242 --> 12:29.242
 Yeah

12:29.242 --> 12:29.728
 Thank you for watching.

12:29.728 --> 12:31.728
 Wow!

12:31.728 --> 12:33.728
 This is my first time to eat pizza.

12:33.728 --> 12:35.728
 It's fruity.

12:35.728 --> 12:37.728
 It's really good.

12:37.728 --> 12:39.728
 I think it's good for people who don't
like salty food.

12:39.728 --> 12:41.728
 Pizza and peach go well together.

12:41.728 --> 12:43.728
 Yes.

12:43.728 --> 12:45.728
 They go well together.

12:45.728 --> 12:47.728
 It's like a sweet.

12:49.728 --> 12:53.728
 There are other peaches.

12:53.728 --> 12:55.728
 We can't finish this.

12:55.728 --> 12:57.728
 That's right.

12:57.728 --> 13:01.728
 I want you to call Okazaki-san back.

13:01.728 --> 13:03.728
 I'm sorry.

13:03.728 --> 13:05.728
 Okazaki-san.

13:05.728 --> 13:07.728
 Okazaki-chan.

13:07.728 --> 13:09.728
 You enjoyed it.

13:09.728 --> 13:11.728
 Yes.

13:11.728 --> 13:15.728
 We have a lecture about the next peach.

13:15.728 --> 13:17.728
 What do you mean?

13:17.728 --> 13:19.728
 It's like this.

13:19.728 --> 13:21.728
 Is it about peaches?

13:21.728 --> 13:23.728
 Yes.

13:23.728 --> 13:25.728
 It's a lecture about peaches.

13:25.728 --> 13:27.728
 Let's go.

13:27.728 --> 13:29.728
 Please subscribe to this channel.

13:31.080 --> 13:40.080
 Yeah, I moved the place, and I was
guided by Mr. Okazaki with a little
peach connection, but what do you do?

13:40.080 --> 13:44.080
 It's in front of you. Actually, it's a
peach-shaped

13:44.080 --> 13:46.080
 Mr. Kokeshi.

13:46.080 --> 13:52.730
 Say Momo-chan.

13:52.730 --> 13:56.730
 But it's still not in the face.

13:56.730 --> 13:58.730
 Yes, it's like a doll.

13:58.730 --> 14:03.730
 From now on, I will have a picture
experience.

14:03.730 --> 14:04.730
 I will.

14:04.730 --> 14:06.730
 Congratulations.

14:06.730 --> 14:07.730
 Thank you.

14:07.730 --> 14:11.730
 So, the teacher of the picture
experience is Mr. Sato.

14:11.730 --> 14:14.730
 Thank you.

14:14.730 --> 14:15.730
 I'm looking forward to working with
you.

14:15.730 --> 14:19.730
 I'm going to make one of the world's
best Fukumomo-chan Kogashi.

14:19.730 --> 14:21.472
 I'm looking forward to working with
you.

14:22.472 --> 14:25.472
 I'm going to give you one more chance.

14:25.472 --> 14:27.472
 Who do you want to give this to?

14:27.472 --> 14:30.472
 If you get this right,

14:30.472 --> 14:38.472
 you can write your dream, hope, wish,
and free will.

14:38.472 --> 14:45.472
 That's what I'm writing about.

14:45.658 --> 14:47.658
 How is it?

14:47.658 --> 14:49.658
 Unique!

14:49.658 --> 14:51.658
 Really?

14:51.658 --> 14:53.658
 Delicious!

14:54.496 --> 14:56.496
 The most boring one is the safety of
the wife.

14:58.496 --> 14:59.496
 I love it.

14:59.496 --> 15:01.496
 I'm going to write it down.

15:04.496 --> 15:05.496
 I'm going to write it down.

15:08.496 --> 15:09.496
 Are you ready?

15:09.496 --> 15:10.496
 Yes.

15:10.496 --> 15:12.496
 So, let's get started.

15:12.496 --> 15:13.496
 Yes.

15:13.496 --> 15:15.496
 First, who do you want to write to?

15:15.496 --> 15:16.496
 Yes.

15:16.496 --> 15:17.496
 One person.

15:17.496 --> 15:21.496
 I want to write to Mr. Kiginari Tohoku.

15:21.496 --> 15:24.496
 I hope you can build a sense of unity
with 9 people.

15:29.050 --> 15:32.050
 I'm not dreaming, I'm aiming for it.

15:32.050 --> 15:34.050
 It's not a dream, it's a goal.

15:34.050 --> 15:35.050
 Yes, it's a goal.

15:35.050 --> 15:36.050
 It's hard.

15:36.050 --> 15:38.050
 But it's okay.

15:38.050 --> 15:41.050
 I'm going to go next.

15:41.050 --> 15:44.050
 I put it on myself.

15:44.050 --> 15:46.050
 I'll go.

15:46.050 --> 15:53.850
 Thank you for watching this video.
Please subscribe to this channel.

15:53.850 --> 15:55.850
 I'm so nervous.

15:57.850 --> 15:59.850
 I believe in myself.

15:59.850 --> 16:10.850
 I hope everyone will be happy.

16:11.928 --> 16:13.928
 It's a little bit on your face.

16:13.928 --> 16:15.928
 I'm doing it with the tone of my voice.

16:17.928 --> 16:24.928
 So, this Fukumomo-chan we made this
time will be exhibited somewhere in
Horima-chan later.

16:24.928 --> 16:25.928
 Thank you very much.

16:25.928 --> 16:27.928
 The box is here.

16:27.928 --> 16:29.928
 Here, here, together.

16:29.928 --> 16:31.928
 I'm so happy.

16:31.928 --> 16:32.928
 I did it.

16:32.928 --> 16:33.928
 I'm happy.

16:33.928 --> 16:35.928
 Mr. Okazaki.

16:35.928 --> 16:38.928
 Thank you very much, Mr. Sato.

16:38.928 --> 16:43.928
 So far, everyone has experienced
various peaches.

16:43.928 --> 16:44.928
 Yes.

16:44.928 --> 16:46.928
 There is one more peach.

16:46.928 --> 16:47.928
 I did it.

16:47.928 --> 16:49.928
 Let's go to experience another peach.

16:49.928 --> 16:50.928
 Let's go.

16:53.928 --> 16:54.928
 We have arrived.

16:54.928 --> 16:55.928
 Yes.

16:57.928 --> 17:03.928
 Today, as you can see from this, we are
in the peach field in the season.

17:03.928 --> 17:05.928
 We are in the peach field of Mr. Goto.

17:05.928 --> 17:06.928
 Mr. Goto.

17:06.928 --> 17:07.928
 Thank you.

17:07.928 --> 17:08.928
 Thank you.

17:08.928 --> 17:09.928
 Nice to meet you.

17:09.928 --> 17:10.928
 Thank you.

17:10.928 --> 17:20.928
 Horimachi is a peach village that has
been producing peaches for 29 years in
the Tennokei and Miyake prefectures.

17:20.928 --> 17:27.928
 We always send the highest quality
peaches from Horimachi to all over the
country.

17:27.928 --> 17:31.928
 I hope you can see the peaches of Mr.
Goto's house.

17:31.928 --> 17:32.928
 Thank you, Mr. Goto.

17:32.928 --> 17:33.928
 Thank you.

17:33.928 --> 17:34.928
 Thank you.

17:34.928 --> 17:35.928
 Thank you.

17:35.928 --> 17:38.928
 I have been making peaches for about 40
years.

17:38.928 --> 17:39.928
 Wow.

17:39.928 --> 17:42.928
 There are about 12 varieties here.

17:42.928 --> 17:56.928
 As I mentioned earlier, the variety
called Akatsuki in the white area
written in red is the Akatsuki in the
100 hectares of peach area of 200
hectares in Horimachi.

17:56.928 --> 18:02.928
 So, I think it's good to think that
half of the area is Akatsuki.

18:02.928 --> 18:14.928
 It's hard to get the peaches in the
market now, but it takes about three
days to get them in your mouth, so I'm
harvesting them so that they become soft
at that time.

18:14.928 --> 18:16.928
 You can't twist them.

18:16.928 --> 18:21.928
 So, the best thing is to pull them out
vertically.

18:21.928 --> 18:22.928
 Like this.

18:22.928 --> 18:24.928
 Wow.

18:24.928 --> 18:25.928
 Splash.

18:25.928 --> 18:26.928
 Please do it.

18:26.928 --> 18:27.928
 Yes.

18:27.928 --> 18:28.928
 Is it okay?

18:28.928 --> 18:29.928
 Who will do it?

18:29.928 --> 18:30.928
 I'm glad.

18:30.928 --> 18:32.928
 I'm glad.

18:32.928 --> 18:33.928
 I'll do it.

18:33.928 --> 18:34.928
 It takes a lot of power.

18:34.928 --> 18:35.928
 Wow.

18:35.928 --> 18:36.928
 Oh, no.

18:36.928 --> 18:37.928
 What?

18:37.928 --> 18:38.928
 I'm sorry.

18:38.928 --> 18:39.928
 It's okay.

18:39.928 --> 18:40.928
 I'll do it.

18:40.928 --> 18:42.928
 Wow.

18:42.928 --> 18:43.928
 It takes a lot of power.

18:43.928 --> 18:44.928
 It does.

18:44.928 --> 18:45.928
 How is it?

18:45.928 --> 18:46.928
 It's passed.

18:46.928 --> 18:47.928
 It's passed.

18:47.928 --> 18:48.928
 It's good.

18:48.928 --> 18:49.928
 It's really...

18:49.928 --> 18:50.928
 One, two.

18:50.928 --> 18:51.928
 It's pretty...

18:53.928 --> 18:54.928
 It's okay.

18:54.928 --> 18:55.928
 It's cute.

18:55.928 --> 18:56.928
 It's cute.

18:56.928 --> 18:58.928
 It's soft.

18:58.928 --> 19:03.928
 We got them, so we'll eat them and go
home.

19:03.928 --> 19:05.888
 Please subscribe to this channel.

19:06.888 --> 19:11.888
 I'm going to eat it.

19:11.888 --> 19:13.888
 Thank you.

19:13.888 --> 19:14.888
 I'm happy.

19:14.888 --> 19:15.888
 It looks delicious.

19:15.888 --> 19:17.888
 Let's eat.

19:19.888 --> 19:21.888
 It smells so good.

19:21.888 --> 19:22.888
 I know.

19:26.888 --> 19:28.888
 It's delicious.

19:28.888 --> 19:29.808
 How is it?

19:30.808 --> 19:32.808
 It's really delicious.

19:33.808 --> 19:35.808
 It's delicious.

19:35.808 --> 19:38.808
 The taste of peach is not so sweet as
to say,

19:38.808 --> 19:41.808
 It's sweet. It's not so sweet as to
say,

19:44.440 --> 19:46.440
 It's a little bit sweet.

19:46.440 --> 19:48.440
 Hotapi.

19:48.440 --> 19:50.440
 It's mixed well.

19:50.440 --> 19:51.440
 You don't know?

19:51.440 --> 19:52.440
 Yes.

19:52.440 --> 19:53.440
 Thank you.

19:53.440 --> 19:55.440
 My dream is peach.

19:56.440 --> 19:59.440
 It's hotapi which is popular now.

19:59.440 --> 20:01.440
 The peach of hotapi is peach.

20:01.440 --> 20:03.440
 Please subscribe to my Gyo channel.

20:05.032 --> 20:07.032
 I heard there is another feature of
hotapi.

20:07.032 --> 20:11.032
 I'll ask the fairy behind me.

20:11.032 --> 20:13.032
 Fairy!

20:13.032 --> 20:15.032
 Yes?

20:15.032 --> 20:19.032
 I heard that the peach of hotapi is
peach.

20:19.032 --> 20:21.032
 I understand.

20:21.032 --> 20:23.032
 What is hota?

20:23.032 --> 20:25.032
 What? Hota?

20:25.032 --> 20:26.032
 Yes.

20:26.032 --> 20:32.032
 Let's go to the next place about the
mystery of hota.

20:32.032 --> 20:35.032
 I haven't finished eating yet. Can you
stand up a little more?

20:35.032 --> 20:37.032
 I understand.

20:37.032 --> 20:39.032
 I'm going to eat hotapi.

20:39.032 --> 20:42.032
 We have arrived.

20:42.032 --> 20:44.032
 It's pitch black.

20:44.032 --> 20:49.032
 This is called the village of the plum.

20:49.032 --> 20:51.032
 There is a signboard.

20:51.032 --> 20:53.032
 The village of the plum.

20:53.032 --> 20:58.032
 This is the hotapi that I mentioned
earlier.

20:58.032 --> 21:00.032
 I see.

21:00.032 --> 21:02.032
 I was wondering what it was.

21:02.032 --> 21:05.032
 I can see fireflies.

21:05.032 --> 21:06.032
 Fireflies?

21:06.032 --> 21:08.032
 I can see fireflies.

21:08.032 --> 21:09.032
 Do you want to see?

21:09.032 --> 21:11.032
 I want to see.

21:11.032 --> 21:13.032
 I'm glad you're in Manchester.

21:13.032 --> 21:15.032
 Let's go to see fireflies.

21:15.032 --> 21:17.032
 I'm scared.

21:17.032 --> 21:22.032
 Let's go to see fireflies.

21:22.032 --> 21:30.032
 Please subscribe to this channel.

21:30.234 --> 21:32.234
 Wow, it's so beautiful!

21:32.234 --> 21:34.234
 It's so small!

21:34.234 --> 21:36.234
 It's shining!

21:36.234 --> 21:38.234
 It's so beautiful!

21:38.234 --> 21:40.234
 It's like a dream!

21:40.234 --> 21:42.234
 It's amazing!

21:42.234 --> 21:44.234
 It's so beautiful!

21:44.234 --> 21:46.234
 The next day

21:48.234 --> 21:50.234
 So...

21:50.234 --> 21:52.234
 The next day

21:52.234 --> 21:54.234
 The next day

21:54.234 --> 21:55.066
 The next day

21:55.066 --> 21:58.066
 The fireflies were very beautiful.

21:58.066 --> 22:00.066
 I'm glad.

22:00.066 --> 22:02.066
 There were a lot of fireflies.

22:02.066 --> 22:06.066
 There are more fireflies in the season.

22:06.066 --> 22:09.066
 My body is covered with fireflies.

22:09.066 --> 22:12.066
 Maybe.

22:12.066 --> 22:17.066
 There are many things to eat and see.

22:17.066 --> 22:19.066
 There are many things to see.

22:19.066 --> 22:23.066
 There are many things to see and
Kumamon will decorate the house.

22:23.066 --> 22:25.066
 I see.

22:25.066 --> 22:28.066
 I hope you will be safe.

22:28.066 --> 22:33.066
 You can enjoy the fireflies and see
what we made today.
