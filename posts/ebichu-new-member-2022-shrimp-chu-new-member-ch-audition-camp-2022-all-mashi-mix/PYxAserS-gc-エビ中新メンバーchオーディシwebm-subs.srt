I've never seen the change

14
00:00:35,632 --> 00:00:40,632
The members of the country are very
close to each other

00:00:42,632 --> 00:00:44,632

Thank you for watching!

28
00:01:16,736 --> 00:01:18,736
Thank you very much

29
00:01:23,760 --> 00:01:24,760
Good morning

30
00:01:25,760 --> 00:01:27,760
Today is the recording of Kannai Devil

31
00:01:28,760 --> 00:01:30,760
I was thinking why I should do it

32
00:01:31,760 --> 00:01:33,760
I was nervous and I was about to freeze

33
00:01:33,760 --> 00:01:36,760
I will do my best not to freeze

34
00:01:38,760 --> 00:01:40,760
New members have visited

jobs

00:02:06,112 --> 00:02:12,352
The two new members who are performing
for the first time this time are still

41
00:02:12,352 --> 00:02:14,352
This is Yono-chan

00:02:14,352 --> 00:02:16,352
Oh, it's Yono-chan

00:02:16,352 --> 00:02:17,352
Yes

44
00:02:17,352 --> 00:02:18,352
It's perfect

45
00:02:18,352 --> 00:02:20,352
It's pretty perfect

46
00:02:20,352 --> 00:02:21,352
Yes

47
00:02:21,352 --> 00:02:26,336
O..one is here!

00:02:26,336 --> 00:02:30,336
First, we will take a photo using the
program's website

49
00:02:32,336 --> 00:02:34,336
Everyone, what is the meaning of Hido
Aya Raki?

50
00:02:34,336 --> 00:02:35,336
I don't know

51
00:02:35,336 --> 00:02:37,336
Yes, please take a look

52
00:02:37,336 --> 00:02:39,336
Please show us your various poses

53
00:02:39,336 --> 00:02:41,336
I will do it with all my heart

54
00:02:47,336 --> 00:02:49,336
I can't do it myself

55
00:02:51,336 --> 00:02:52,336
Hido Aya Raki's Do

56
00:02:52,336 --> 00:02:53,336
Do is?

57
00:02:53,336 --> 00:02:54,336
Do

58
00:02:54,336 --> 00:02:56,336
Do is

59
00:02:57,336 --> 00:02:59,336
What was your last word?

60
00:02:59,336 --> 00:03:01,336
I understood it

61
00:03:01,336 --> 00:03:03,336
I understand it

62
00:03:03,336 --> 00:03:16,112
Thank you for watching!

63
00:03:16,112 --> 00:03:17,992

Srieben by yeti

65
00:03:23,392 --> 00:03:25,032
Cute

66
00:03:25,692 --> 00:03:27,072
Kururu Kofei

67
00:03:27,072 --> 00:03:29,072
I'm not sure if I can do it.

68
00:03:29,072 --> 00:03:30,072
I'm not sure.

69
00:03:30,072 --> 00:03:32,072
He's shaking with his heels.

70
00:03:32,072 --> 00:03:33,072
Isn't it cute?

71
00:03:33,072 --> 00:03:35,072
He's shaking his feet.

72
00:03:35,072 --> 00:03:38,384
Thank you for watching.

73
00:03:38,384 --> 00:03:43,384
At the same time, Emma is creating a
history book that she uses in the
program.

74
00:03:43,384 --> 00:03:53,384
If this is a name, Hikahira Gana, is it
okay to just have the name Furigana?

75
00:03:53,384 --> 00:03:57,152
I've already made all the radio.

76
00:03:57,152 --> 00:04:01,952
But I don't know how to say it on TV.

77
00:04:01,952 --> 00:04:07,692
I usually watch it myself, but I don't
know how to say it.

78
00:04:07,692 --> 00:04:10,392
What should I do if I'm in trouble?

79
00:04:10,392 --> 00:04:11,952
I'll go home for now.

80
00:04:11,952 --> 00:04:15,856
What?

81
00:04:15,856 --> 00:04:17,856
Master

82
00:04:19,856 --> 00:04:21,856
Nice to meet you, I'm Yuma Sakura

83
00:04:21,856 --> 00:04:23,856
Nice to meet you

84
00:04:23,856 --> 00:04:26,856
I'm Yuma Sakura, nice to meet you

85
00:04:26,856 --> 00:04:30,856
I'm Mami Saburo, nice to meet you

86
00:04:31,856 --> 00:04:34,856
Yuma also changes into her costume and
takes pictures

87
00:04:34,856 --> 00:04:41,856
euro

88
00:04:41,856 --> 00:04:46,856
Let's do it with a different feeling.

89
00:04:46,856 --> 00:04:48,856
Change the feeling of the foot.

90
00:04:48,856 --> 00:04:58,138
Change the feeling of the foot.

91
00:04:58,978 --> 00:05:00,918
what's wrong with him?

92
00:05:00,918 --> 00:05:02,918
Thank you for watching!

93
00:05:10,586 --> 00:05:14,586
I don't have a phone, so I don't speak.

94
00:05:14,586 --> 00:05:17,586
If I don't speak, I have nothing.

95
00:05:17,586 --> 00:05:22,586
I want you to say something interesting.

96
00:05:22,586 --> 00:05:26,586
Something interesting is something that
makes you laugh.

97
00:05:26,586 --> 00:05:28,586
Good morning.

98
00:05:28,586 --> 00:05:30,586
I'm going to the TV.

99
00:05:38,586 --> 00:05:42,586
Finally, they are going to try to record
for the first time.

100
00:05:42,586 --> 00:05:45,586
Thank you.

101
00:05:45,586 --> 00:05:55,586
This time, they will deliver the first
broadcast.

102
00:05:56,720 --> 00:06:00,720
New members of Ebichu.

103
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:02,720
That's right.

104
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:08,720
Sakurai Emma and Yuna Nakamura from
Shiritu Ebichu Middle School came.

105
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:11,720
Thank you.

106
00:06:11,720 --> 00:06:16,720
We are Shiritu Ebichu Middle School.

107
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:18,720
We are Ebichu.

108
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:20,720
It's delicious.

109
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:24,720
I'm nervous.

110
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:28,720
I'm not satisfied that they are a little
off.

111
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:30,720
Cute.

112
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:32,720
If we get a little more time, we will
meet.

113
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:34,720
We only have this moment.

114
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:36,720
They are professionals.

115
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:38,720
They are fast.

116
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:40,720
Thank you.

117
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:44,720
They are Shiritu Ebichu Middle School.

118
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:50,720
They will work at this company.

119
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:54,720
We will give you a release award.

120
00:06:54,912 --> 00:06:57,912
She has a qualification.

121
00:06:57,912 --> 00:06:58,912
What is it?

122
00:06:58,912 --> 00:06:59,912
Amazing.

123
00:06:59,912 --> 00:07:04,912
Sakurai-san, A-ken 3-kyu.

124
00:07:04,912 --> 00:07:06,912
No, Kanken 3-kyu.

125
00:07:06,912 --> 00:07:08,912
A-ken is also 3-kyu.

126
00:07:08,912 --> 00:07:10,912
Kanken A-ken 3-kyu.

127
00:07:10,912 --> 00:07:12,912
Kendama is also 4-kyu.

128
00:07:12,912 --> 00:07:14,912
Is there a Kendama competition?

129
00:07:14,912 --> 00:07:16,912
I'm going to the school.

130
00:07:16,912 --> 00:07:18,912
That's the standard of school.

131
00:07:18,912 --> 00:07:20,912
I'm going to 4-kyu.

132
00:07:21,912 --> 00:07:23,912
Kendama, come here.

133
00:07:23,912 --> 00:07:25,912
Please give me a Kendama.

134
00:07:25,912 --> 00:07:27,912
Thank you.

135
00:07:29,912 --> 00:07:31,912
It's a little difficult to do.

136
00:07:32,912 --> 00:07:34,912
This is the big plate.

137
00:07:34,912 --> 00:07:36,912
There is a big plate.

138
00:07:38,912 --> 00:07:40,912
Please.

139
00:07:44,912 --> 00:07:46,912
Amazing.

140
00:07:46,912 --> 00:07:48,912
Amazing.

141
00:07:48,912 --> 00:07:50,912
Is that so?

142
00:07:50,912 --> 00:07:53,912
There are various things.

143
00:07:53,912 --> 00:07:56,912
She has various hobbies and specialties.

144
00:07:56,912 --> 00:07:59,912
By the way, Nakamura-san.

145
00:07:59,912 --> 00:08:02,912
She plays with a dog that she is
interested in.

146
00:08:02,912 --> 00:08:04,912
Sometimes she goes fishing.

147
00:08:05,912 --> 00:08:08,912
Her special skills are standing bridge.

148
00:08:08,912 --> 00:08:10,912
And hula hoop.

149
00:08:10,912 --> 00:08:12,912
She has a strange face.

150
00:08:12,912 --> 00:08:15,912
I don't think she has a strange face.

151
00:08:15,912 --> 00:08:17,912
I've never seen a strange face.

152
00:08:17,912 --> 00:08:20,912
If you have a strange face, you can
destroy it.

153
00:08:21,912 --> 00:08:24,912
You should do this.

154
00:08:24,912 --> 00:08:26,912
This?

155
00:08:26,912 --> 00:08:28,912
If you put shrimp in it, it's NG.

156
00:08:28,912 --> 00:08:30,912
It doesn't exist.

157
00:08:32,912 --> 00:08:34,912
Let's do it.

158
00:08:34,912 --> 00:08:36,912
Ready, go.

159
00:08:40,912 --> 00:08:43,912
It was more strange than I thought.

160
00:08:43,912 --> 00:08:47,912
I was getting a cold.

161
00:08:47,912 --> 00:08:50,912
This was a special skill.

162
00:08:50,912 --> 00:08:54,912
There is a desire.

163
00:08:54,912 --> 00:08:58,912
We are doing it as a store.

164
00:08:58,912 --> 00:09:00,912
That's right.

165
00:09:00,912 --> 00:09:04,912
I felt the momentum.

166
00:09:04,912 --> 00:09:07,912
I'm already wearing a uniform.

167
00:09:07,912 --> 00:09:09,912
That's strange.

168
00:09:09,912 --> 00:09:12,912
Why are you wearing a uniform before you
put out the certificate?

169
00:09:12,912 --> 00:09:16,912
I'm not a restaurant worker.

170
00:09:16,912 --> 00:09:19,912
I'm not a restaurant worker.

171
00:09:19,912 --> 00:09:22,912
You are a person who can't say no.

172
00:09:22,912 --> 00:09:25,912
I thought it was strange when I entered
the store.

173
00:09:25,912 --> 00:09:28,912
That's it.

174
00:09:28,912 --> 00:09:30,912
That's good.

175
00:09:30,912 --> 00:09:32,912
It's a good thing.

176
00:09:32,912 --> 00:09:34,912
It looks good on you.

177
00:09:35,912 --> 00:09:39,912
The show was exciting and ended safely.

178
00:09:39,912 --> 00:09:41,912
That's good.

179
00:09:41,912 --> 00:09:43,912
Thank you.

180
00:09:43,912 --> 00:09:46,912
That's all for the two of you.

181
00:09:46,912 --> 00:09:49,912
Thank you.

182
00:09:50,912 --> 00:09:55,912
They asked EMMA and YUNA about their
impressions.

183
00:09:55,912 --> 00:09:58,912
The wind was refreshing.

184
00:09:58,912 --> 00:10:00,912
It was cute.

185
00:10:00,912 --> 00:10:04,912
I'm not saying that MAYAMAYAMAN is not
refreshing.

186
00:10:04,912 --> 00:10:06,912
I'm sorry.

187
00:10:06,912 --> 00:10:08,912
I thought it wasn't there.

188
00:10:08,912 --> 00:10:10,912
But it was amazing.

189
00:10:10,912 --> 00:10:14,912
They were very cute.

190
00:10:14,912 --> 00:10:21,912
The last time we were together, we were
very cute.

191
00:10:21,912 --> 00:10:23,912
But when I came alone, they were very
cute.

192
00:10:23,912 --> 00:10:25,912
They are very cute.

193
00:10:25,912 --> 00:10:27,912
They were very cute.

194
00:10:27,912 --> 00:10:31,912
They are very cute.

195
00:10:31,912 --> 00:10:33,912
I said it many times.

196
00:10:33,912 --> 00:10:35,912
They have a lot of potential.

197
00:10:35,912 --> 00:10:38,912
I think I will lose if I fight.

198
00:10:38,912 --> 00:10:40,912
I think I will lose.

199
00:10:40,912 --> 00:10:42,912
I will not fight.

200
00:10:42,912 --> 00:10:44,912
I think they have a gap.

201
00:10:44,912 --> 00:10:46,912
I'm looking forward to it.

202
00:10:46,912 --> 00:10:50,912
I was the first to appear on the show.

203
00:10:50,912 --> 00:10:52,912
I was hiding.

204
00:10:52,912 --> 00:10:56,912
I didn't have a chance to announce it.

205
00:10:56,912 --> 00:11:00,912
I will enter the shift and show my true
self.

206
00:11:00,912 --> 00:11:02,912
I'm looking forward to being with you.

207
00:11:02,912 --> 00:11:04,912
Yes.

208
00:11:04,912 --> 00:11:09,056
They finished recording.

209
00:11:09,056 --> 00:11:11,056
I was so excited.

210
00:11:12,056 --> 00:11:19,056
I was thinking about what to say, but I
was so excited.

211
00:11:20,056 --> 00:11:30,056
They talked to me a lot and I was happy
to talk to them.

212
00:11:31,056 --> 00:11:35,056
I didn't know about KENDA, but I was
surprised.

213
00:11:35,056 --> 00:11:39,056
I'm glad I was able to talk to them.

214
00:11:40,056 --> 00:11:44,056
I'm still nervous.

215
00:11:45,056 --> 00:11:48,056
I'm nervous because I'm alone.

216
00:11:48,056 --> 00:11:52,864
I'm nervous because I'm alone.

217
00:11:52,864 --> 00:11:55,864
But I'll do my best.

218
00:11:57,864 --> 00:12:02,864
Next time, the last episode of Zenmashi
MIX.

219
00:12:02,864 --> 00:12:12,864
December 14th, Wednesday night live.
