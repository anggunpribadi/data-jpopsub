 Are you okay?

 I'm cold.

 Ichigo Ichigo Ichigo Ichigo

00:17.000 --> 00:19.000
 I was 21 years old.

00:19.000 --> 00:21.000
 I was 21 years old.

00:21.000 --> 00:24.000
 I was 21 years old.

00:26.696 --> 00:31.696
 This program is a program that six
people who are active to promote

00:56.090 --> 00:59.810
 I'm grazing my teeth

00:59.890 --> 01:04.810
 Yes, just like that

01:09.690 --> 01:13.890
 Do you have the things you wish people
would look at?

01:13.890 --> 01:14.288
 Thank you for watching.

01:15.148 --> 01:19.388
 Part of the character is people have
interesting personality

01:20.848 --> 01:24.728
 and people have very special faces

01:26.788 --> 01:28.468

01:29.208 --> 01:31.748
 both good at singing and..

01:31.748 --> 01:32.748
 Bye!

01:35.184 --> 01:37.184
 Can I take a picture with you?

01:37.184 --> 01:39.184
 Let's take a picture together.

01:39.184 --> 01:41.184
 I'm fine.

01:41.184 --> 01:43.184
 Let's take a picture together.

01:43.184 --> 01:45.184
 Let's take a picture together.

01:45.184 --> 01:47.184
 OK.

01:49.184 --> 01:51.184
 This is funny.

01:51.184 --> 01:53.184
 I'm so nervous.

01:55.184 --> 01:57.184
 Thank you.

01:57.184 --> 01:59.184
 Thank you for taking a picture with me.

01:59.184 --> 02:01.184
 Thank you.

02:01.184 --> 02:02.144
 Thank you.

02:03.144 --> 02:05.144
 What is your hobby?

02:06.144 --> 02:08.144
 I like donuts.

02:13.144 --> 02:15.144
 It looks cute.

02:15.144 --> 02:17.144
 Please tell me that you like it.

02:17.144 --> 02:18.144
 It's delicious.

02:18.144 --> 02:21.144
 It's chewy and elastic.

02:21.144 --> 02:24.144
 It's really delicious.

02:24.144 --> 02:25.144
 I like that story.

02:25.144 --> 02:26.144
 I'm sorry.

02:26.144 --> 02:27.144
 Thank you.

02:31.664 --> 02:32.664
 The sensitive yoin

02:32.664 --> 02:33.664
 Fully notified

02:33.664 --> 02:34.664
 Oops

02:36.664 --> 02:38.664
 All wrong

02:38.664 --> 02:40.664
 Why do you get to eat seaweed this
much?

02:44.664 --> 02:45.664
 We're so sad

02:46.664 --> 02:47.664
 Gotta find a meme

02:48.664 --> 02:49.664
 Don't have to

02:49.664 --> 02:52.664
 I was too busy

02:52.664 --> 02:53.664
 Still mumble

02:53.664 --> 02:54.664
 Shaking

02:54.664 --> 02:55.664
 Where's his feet?

02:56.664 --> 02:57.376
 Trying to shove his head in

02:57.776 --> 02:58.516
 Chick!

02:58.516 --> 03:00.516
 I'm sorry.

03:00.516 --> 03:02.516
 I'm sorry.

03:02.516 --> 03:04.516
 I'm sorry.

03:05.904 --> 03:07.904
 I think your sneeze is funny.

03:07.904 --> 03:09.904
 Is it a perfume?

03:11.904 --> 03:13.904
 No, it's not.

03:13.904 --> 03:15.904
 It's a perfume.

03:15.904 --> 03:21.904
 I think your sneeze is funny.

03:21.904 --> 03:23.904
 I think your image is a little
different.

03:23.904 --> 03:25.904
 How do I look?

03:25.904 --> 03:27.904
 How do I look?

03:27.904 --> 03:30.904
 You look like a person.

03:30.904 --> 03:32.904
 How do I look?

03:32.904 --> 03:34.904
 You look like a person.

03:34.904 --> 03:39.904
 Your face is like a person.

03:39.904 --> 03:40.904
 It's not like that.

03:40.904 --> 03:42.904
 Please ask me if I have an ugly face.

03:42.904 --> 03:45.904
 Do you sneeze with an ugly face?

03:45.904 --> 03:47.904
 I may sneeze.

03:47.904 --> 03:52.904
 I took a picture of my face once and
sneezed.

03:52.904 --> 03:54.904
 I posted it on my blog.

03:54.904 --> 03:58.904
 I think that's funny.

03:58.904 --> 04:03.904
 I remember that.

04:04.090 --> 04:07.090
 So, every day, Kanami and Haruka...

04:07.090 --> 04:10.090
 Yeah!

04:13.090 --> 04:14.090
 Mami!

04:14.090 --> 04:15.090
 Mami!

04:15.090 --> 04:17.090
 We were giving instructions.

04:17.090 --> 04:19.090
 Did you see that?

04:19.090 --> 04:21.090
 Hiyori's ugly face.

04:21.090 --> 04:23.090
 Hiyori did that.

04:23.090 --> 04:26.090
 When I asked her if she had an ugly
face,

04:26.090 --> 04:28.090
 she said, oh, yeah.

04:28.090 --> 04:31.090
 So I said, hey, Banzi!

04:31.090 --> 04:34.090
 Let's do it, too.

04:34.090 --> 04:36.090
 It's the same person.

04:36.090 --> 04:37.090
 It looks fun.

04:37.090 --> 04:39.090
 The last one is Haruka.

04:39.090 --> 04:41.090
 The last one is Haruka.

04:41.090 --> 04:43.090
 The last one is Haruka.

 I got it.

04:56.058 --> 04:58.058
 I'm nervous.

04:58.058 --> 05:00.058
 I'm nervous.

05:00.058 --> 05:02.058
 I'm nervous.

05:02.058 --> 05:04.058
 I'm nervous.

05:04.058 --> 05:06.058
 Thank you.

05:06.058 --> 05:08.058
 I'm sorry.

05:08.058 --> 05:10.058
 Are you okay?

05:10.058 --> 05:12.058

 I spilled my tea yesterday.

05:28.122 --> 05:29.122
 Really?

05:30.122 --> 05:33.122
 I spilled it on my sister's desk.

05:33.122 --> 05:42.122
 Thank you for watching. Please
subscribe to our channel.

05:43.240 --> 05:50.240
 It's not sold out in Korea, but it's
good for your health.

05:52.240 --> 05:56.240
 It's not sold out at all.

06:00.240 --> 06:02.240
 What do you want people to see?

06:02.240 --> 06:13.240
 We are a very energetic group.

06:13.240 --> 06:15.240
 First of all, I'm going to introduce
myself.

06:15.240 --> 06:16.240
 I'm sorry.

06:16.240 --> 06:17.240
 It's okay.

06:17.240 --> 06:18.240
 I'm sorry.

06:18.240 --> 06:19.240
 I'm sorry.

06:20.240 --> 06:21.240
 Hello.

06:21.240 --> 06:24.240
 I'm sorry. I'll rewrite it.

06:24.240 --> 06:25.240
 What song is it?

06:27.240 --> 06:29.240
 I like Tokisen.

06:29.240 --> 06:30.240
 Is that so?

06:30.240 --> 06:32.240
 Is it a song of Don Fiction?

06:32.240 --> 06:33.240
 That's right.

06:33.240 --> 06:34.240
 Is it?

06:34.240 --> 06:35.240
 Is it not?

06:35.240 --> 06:36.240
 It's not.

06:36.240 --> 06:37.240
 I'm glad.

06:39.240 --> 06:40.240
 I'm glad.

06:41.240 --> 06:42.240
 Thank you.

06:42.240 --> 06:44.240
 I'm glad, too.

06:44.240 --> 06:45.240
 Thank you.

06:45.240 --> 06:46.240
 Are you a mario?

06:46.240 --> 06:47.240
 Yes.

06:48.240 --> 06:49.240
 You're being honest.

06:49.240 --> 06:51.240
 We are all mario.

06:51.240 --> 06:52.240
 Thank you.

06:54.240 --> 06:55.240
 It's dangerous.

06:57.240 --> 06:58.240
 I'm sorry. I'm embarrassed.

06:58.240 --> 07:00.240
 I'm so glad.

07:04.218 --> 07:08.218
 What is your goal?

07:08.218 --> 07:15.218
 My goal is to have a Christmas live at
Nakano Sun Plaza at the end of this
year.

07:15.218 --> 07:18.218
 It's a 2000-person venue.

07:18.218 --> 07:22.218
 I want to fill that 2000 people.

07:22.218 --> 07:30.218
 Last time I did it at the Maehama
office, but I couldn't fill it.

07:30.218 --> 07:34.218
 I was really frustrated.

07:34.218 --> 07:44.218
 I announced that I would do it at the
Tsukikuni last year.

07:44.218 --> 07:51.218
 I have a year's period, so I want to
increase the number of visitors.

07:51.218 --> 07:53.218
 The number of visitors is...

07:53.218 --> 07:56.218
 Wait a minute.

07:56.218 --> 07:59.218
 It's okay.

07:59.218 --> 08:01.218
 Is there an accident?

08:01.218 --> 08:03.218
 It's okay.

08:03.218 --> 08:06.218
 Wait a minute.

08:06.218 --> 08:08.218
 It's okay.

08:08.218 --> 08:12.218
 It's okay if it's cute.

08:12.218 --> 08:14.218
 It's cute.

08:14.218 --> 08:16.218
 Thank you.

08:16.218 --> 08:19.218
 What were we talking about?

08:19.218 --> 08:21.218
 I want to fill it.

08:21.218 --> 08:26.218
 I want to fill it.

08:26.218 --> 08:28.218
 What are you into recently?

08:28.218 --> 08:31.218
 I'm into tapioca.

08:31.218 --> 08:33.218
 I love tapioca.

08:33.218 --> 08:38.218
 I drank it for the first time when I
went to Harajuku.

08:38.218 --> 08:40.218
 I didn't feel attractive at that time.

08:40.218 --> 08:42.218
 I saw it on Twitter.

08:42.218 --> 08:44.218
 You were singing a strawberry song.

08:44.218 --> 08:46.218
 Strawberry song?

08:46.218 --> 08:49.218
 I sing a strawberry song.

08:49.218 --> 08:51.218
 You sing in various places.

08:51.218 --> 08:53.218
 I don't sing in various places.

08:53.218 --> 08:56.218
 I love strawberries.

08:56.218 --> 09:01.218
 I was very excited when I received the
strawberry.

09:01.218 --> 09:05.218
 I was very excited and I was able to
sing.

09:05.218 --> 09:07.218
 I want to hear it.

09:07.218 --> 09:09.218
 You want to hear it?

09:09.218 --> 09:11.218
 I've never done it before.

09:11.218 --> 09:14.218
 Is it okay if I sing a strange song?

09:14.218 --> 09:15.218
 Yes.

09:15.218 --> 09:16.218
 Then, I'll sing.

09:16.218 --> 09:17.218
 Thank you.

09:17.218 --> 09:20.218
 Please touch me.

09:20.218 --> 09:22.218
 I'll sing lightly.

09:22.218 --> 09:23.218
 I'll sing.

09:23.218 --> 09:26.218
 Strawberry, strawberry, strawberry,
strawberry.

09:26.218 --> 09:28.218
 Would you like one?

09:28.218 --> 09:31.218
 It's a video.

09:31.218 --> 09:33.218
 It may be a little different.

09:33.218 --> 09:34.218
 Thank you for the meal.

09:34.218 --> 09:35.218
 It's like this.

09:35.218 --> 09:38.330

09:38.330 --> 09:44.330
 What is the most memorable live
performance?

09:44.330 --> 09:51.330
 After Julia came, I think it was
Tokikuri.

09:51.330 --> 09:53.330
 That Christmas live.

09:53.330 --> 09:59.330
 I'm just saying this, but I think it
was a good live performance.

09:59.330 --> 10:02.330
 Are you okay?

10:02.330 --> 10:06.330
 I sneeze.

10:08.330 --> 10:10.330
 Are you sick?

10:10.330 --> 10:12.330
 I'm sorry.

10:12.330 --> 10:17.330
 I'm not sick at all.

10:17.330 --> 10:19.330
 I'm sorry.

10:19.330 --> 10:22.330
 I'm sorry.

10:22.330 --> 10:25.330
 What did you talk about?

10:25.330 --> 10:30.330
 I think Tokikuri is good.

10:30.330 --> 10:35.330
 It was the first big live performance
after Julia came.

10:35.330 --> 10:39.330
 At first, I was worried if Julia would
be okay.

10:39.330 --> 10:44.330
 I was nervous if I did it in such a big
place.

10:44.330 --> 10:49.330
 I'm not used to it, so I'm not used to
singing and dancing.

10:49.330 --> 10:55.330
 It's really hard to show it in front of
the audience.

10:55.330 --> 10:58.330
 I was worried if I would be okay.

10:58.330 --> 11:01.330
 I was able to remember it very quickly.

11:01.330 --> 11:06.330
 I didn't make any mistakes during the
live performance.

11:06.330 --> 11:14.330
 I was happy to perform with a smile
I've never seen before.

11:14.330 --> 11:17.330
 I was impressed.

11:17.330 --> 11:22.330
 There is a dance where you can see
Julia's face.

11:22.330 --> 11:24.330
 I had eyes like this.

11:24.330 --> 11:26.330
 I laughed a lot.

11:26.330 --> 11:29.330
 I couldn't stop smiling.

11:29.330 --> 11:37.498
 I felt like a big sister.

11:37.498 --> 11:41.498
 What would you do if you could do a
special program?

11:41.498 --> 11:43.498
 A special program?

11:43.498 --> 11:44.498
 If you could do something special.

11:44.498 --> 11:46.498
 Ouch! I'm sorry.

11:46.498 --> 11:48.498
 It was a chair.

11:48.498 --> 11:49.498
 It was a chair.

11:49.498 --> 11:51.498
 What?

11:51.498 --> 11:54.498
 Hmm... I don't know.

11:54.498 --> 12:00.160
 I want to try something new.

12:01.160 --> 12:05.160
 I want to go to a training camp with
everyone.

12:05.160 --> 12:22.160
 I want to try something new.

12:23.624 --> 12:25.624
 What do you think of this?

12:26.624 --> 12:28.624
 I thought you were going to get angry.

12:29.624 --> 12:30.624
 I'm angry!

12:37.624 --> 12:38.624
 Why are you all here?

12:38.624 --> 12:40.624
 I'm not angry!

12:41.146 --> 12:43.146
 I'm sure you were like,

12:43.146 --> 12:45.146
 this is so good!

12:45.146 --> 12:47.146
 Is this really good?

12:47.146 --> 12:49.146
 It's so good!

12:49.146 --> 12:51.146
 It's good!

12:51.146 --> 12:53.146
 But it's so sour!

12:53.146 --> 12:55.146
 But it's good!

12:55.146 --> 12:57.146
 This is the one!

12:57.146 --> 12:59.146
 It's still here.

12:59.146 --> 13:01.146
 It's still here!

13:01.146 --> 13:03.146
 I'm embarrassed.

13:03.146 --> 13:05.146
 I was like, wait a minute.

13:05.146 --> 13:07.146
