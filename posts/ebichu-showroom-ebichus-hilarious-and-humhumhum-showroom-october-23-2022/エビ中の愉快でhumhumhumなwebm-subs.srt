00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Thank you for watching!

2
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
Thank you for watching!

3
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Thank you for watching!

4
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
Thank you for watching!

5
00:01:53,114 --> 00:01:57,114
Good evening everyone, it's time for the
morning chimes.

6
00:01:57,114 --> 00:01:59,114
We are Shiritsu Ebisu Chugaku.

7
00:01:59,114 --> 00:02:02,522
Yes!

8
00:02:02,522 --> 00:02:04,522
I took it because I was in a hurry.

9
00:02:04,522 --> 00:02:06,522
It suddenly started.

10
00:02:06,522 --> 00:02:08,522
I'm Yoko Yokooka.

11
00:02:08,522 --> 00:02:10,522
Nice to meet you.

12
00:02:10,522 --> 00:02:12,522
Before we start the show,

13
00:02:12,522 --> 00:02:16,522
I'd like to decide today's MC as usual.

14
00:02:16,522 --> 00:02:20,522
Everyone, please vote for your favorite
number from 1 to 3.

15
00:02:20,522 --> 00:02:24,522
The person who has the number on the
card is today's MC.

16
00:02:24,522 --> 00:02:27,522
Everyone, vote from 1 to 3.

17
00:02:27,522 --> 00:02:29,136
It suddenly started.

18
00:02:29,136 --> 00:02:30,336
It's started.

19
00:02:30,336 --> 00:02:34,536
The time is short, so please be quick.

20
00:02:34,536 --> 00:02:35,536
As expected of the serious person.

21
00:02:35,536 --> 00:02:36,536
Quickly.

22
00:02:37,136 --> 00:02:38,536
It's a rabbit.

23
00:02:38,536 --> 00:02:39,536
It's Halloween.

24
00:02:39,536 --> 00:02:41,536
It's a different color from the one
before.

25
00:02:42,036 --> 00:02:43,536
What is this?

26
00:02:43,536 --> 00:02:44,536
A fox?

27
00:02:44,536 --> 00:02:45,536
It's a cat.

28
00:02:45,536 --> 00:02:46,536
Is it a cat?

29
00:02:46,536 --> 00:02:48,536
Is it okay if I don't do the one before?

30
00:02:48,536 --> 00:02:49,536
It was fast.

31
00:02:49,536 --> 00:02:50,536
When do you think I'll take it?

32
00:02:52,536 --> 00:02:57,536
5, 4, 3, 2, 1

33
00:02:57,536 --> 00:02:57,648
Please subscribe to the channel.

34
00:02:57,648 --> 00:02:59,648
The end!

35
00:02:59,648 --> 00:03:01,648
Let's check the results.

36
00:03:01,648 --> 00:03:03,648
Wait, I haven't seen it.

37
00:03:03,648 --> 00:03:05,648
You haven't seen it?

38
00:03:05,648 --> 00:03:07,648
Wait, I'll hold it.

39
00:03:09,648 --> 00:03:11,648
Number 3 is the most common.

40
00:03:11,648 --> 00:03:12,648
Number 3 is...

41
00:03:12,648 --> 00:03:14,648
Let's do it together.

42
00:03:14,648 --> 00:03:16,648
1, 2, 3!

43
00:03:16,648 --> 00:03:24,288
The winner is Sakurai Kokona with number
3!

44
00:03:24,288 --> 00:03:26,288
Thank you for coming!

45
00:03:26,288 --> 00:03:28,288
You said you did it.

46
00:03:28,288 --> 00:03:30,288
I did it!

47
00:03:30,288 --> 00:03:32,288
I'm going to say it all today.

48
00:03:32,288 --> 00:03:34,288
I wanted to see Yuno's MC.

49
00:03:34,288 --> 00:03:38,288
But, once again, I'm the MC for today.

50
00:03:38,288 --> 00:03:40,288
Thank you.

51
00:03:40,288 --> 00:03:42,288
Please.

52
00:03:42,288 --> 00:03:44,288
It says it's stable.

53
00:03:44,288 --> 00:03:47,904
I was the one who did it.

54
00:03:47,904 --> 00:03:49,904
That's right.

55
00:03:49,904 --> 00:03:51,904
Shall we start?

56
00:03:51,904 --> 00:03:53,904
Yes, let's start.

57
00:03:53,904 --> 00:03:55,904
Let's start.

58
00:03:55,904 --> 00:03:57,904
Ebichu's Fun and Fufufu Showroom.

59
00:04:01,904 --> 00:04:03,904
Today is the 50th episode.

60
00:04:03,904 --> 00:04:07,904
Thank you for watching Ebichu's Fun and
Fufufu Showroom.

61
00:04:07,904 --> 00:04:09,744
Thank you.

62
00:04:09,744 --> 00:04:12,544
It's been about 5 years.

63
00:04:12,544 --> 00:04:13,444
50 episodes.

64
00:04:13,444 --> 00:04:16,144
Thank you for this precious project.

65
00:04:16,144 --> 00:04:17,244
Thank you.

66
00:04:17,244 --> 00:04:18,244
I'll do my best.

67
00:04:18,244 --> 00:04:23,044
Ebichu's Fun and Fufufu Showroom is a
show about our sisterhood.

68
00:04:23,044 --> 00:04:27,344
It's a show about our sisterhood in
Uka's Showroom.

69
00:04:27,344 --> 00:04:27,844
Okay.

70
00:04:27,844 --> 00:04:29,344
Let's see the ranking.

71
00:04:29,344 --> 00:04:31,144
Okay, let's see.

72
00:04:31,144 --> 00:04:33,144
Please tell us.

73
00:04:33,144 --> 00:04:33,944
Okay.

74
00:04:33,944 --> 00:04:34,080

75
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:37,920

For the original showroom avatar, you
can register as a showroom member and
get free or free gift.

82
00:05:06,868 --> 00:05:08,868
Are there many people who are interested
in this?

83
00:05:08,868 --> 00:05:10,168
Oh!

84
00:05:10,168 --> 00:05:12,668
There are many people who are interested
in this.

85
00:05:12,668 --> 00:05:17,968
If you click the Twitter mark below the

Thank you for your cooperation.

00:05:21,468 --> 00:05:23,424
So, from here...

88
00:05:23,424 --> 00:05:25,424
It's time to spread the word!

89
00:05:25,424 --> 00:05:29,424
To make this broadcast seen by many
people,

90
00:05:29,424 --> 00:05:32,424
we will announce it on Ebichu's Twitter.

91

92
00:05:34,424 --> 00:05:35,424
Please.

93
00:05:35,424 --> 00:05:36,424
Manager-san!

94
00:05:36,424 --> 00:05:37,424
Manager-san!

95
00:05:38,424 --> 00:05:40,424
Koko, don't put that on.

96
00:05:40,424 --> 00:05:42,424
I can't see your face.

97
00:05:42,424 --> 00:05:44,424
I'll put it on half.

98
00:05:45,424 --> 00:05:47,424
Here we go.

99
00:05:47,424 --> 00:05:49,424
One, two.

100
00:05:49,424 --> 00:05:51,648
Here we go.

101
00:05:51,648 --> 00:05:53,648
One, two.

102
00:05:54,648 --> 00:05:56,648
Thank you.

103
00:05:56,648 --> 00:05:58,648
Thank you.

104
00:05:58,648 --> 00:06:00,648
How do you like it?

105
00:06:00,648 --> 00:06:02,648
They say it's cute.

106
00:06:02,648 --> 00:06:04,648
They say it's sexy.

107
00:06:04,648 --> 00:06:06,648
I'm happy.

108
00:06:06,648 --> 00:06:08,648
So, we're going to do this today.

109
00:06:08,648 --> 00:06:09,648
Yes.

110
00:06:09,648 --> 00:06:15,888
We're going to do a fun and fluffy
survey talk.

111
00:06:15,888 --> 00:06:21,888
We did this last time and it was a good
result, so we'd like to do another
survey.

112
00:06:21,888 --> 00:06:26,888
Before we start, we'll decide on the
topic to talk about in the survey.

113
00:06:26,888 --> 00:06:27,388
Okay.

114
00:06:27,388 --> 00:06:29,888
Shall we start talking about the topic?

115
00:06:29,888 --> 00:06:32,388
Okay, let's start talking about the
topic.

116
00:06:32,388 --> 00:06:33,388
Ta-da!

117
00:06:33,388 --> 00:06:34,388
Ta-da!

118
00:06:34,388 --> 00:06:36,388
Can you read the first part?

119
00:06:36,388 --> 00:06:37,888
Okay, first, the first part.

120
00:06:37,888 --> 00:06:39,888
About the new member announcement.

121
00:06:39,888 --> 00:06:40,388
Okay.

122
00:06:40,388 --> 00:06:41,388
And the second part.

123
00:06:41,388 --> 00:06:41,888
It's going to be a lot.

124
00:06:41,888 --> 00:06:43,388
About the 200,000 ZEP Tour.

125
00:06:43,388 --> 00:06:43,888
Okay.

126
00:06:43,888 --> 00:06:46,888
And from here, it's going to be a little
bit interesting.

127
00:06:46,888 --> 00:06:49,888
So, from Maru-san, first, she wants to
get a mount.

128
00:06:49,888 --> 00:06:50,888
What does that mean?

129
00:06:50,888 --> 00:06:51,888
What a mean woman.

130
00:06:51,888 --> 00:06:53,888
Okay, and next, Maru-4.

131
00:06:53,888 --> 00:06:55,392
How to eat delicious food.

132
00:06:55,392 --> 00:06:57,392
I'm curious.

133
00:06:57,392 --> 00:07:00,392
Okay, next, Maru-5.

134
00:07:00,392 --> 00:07:02,392
I'm curious about this.

135
00:07:02,392 --> 00:07:04,392
It's the most serious one.

136
00:07:04,392 --> 00:07:06,392
It's a serious one.

137
00:07:06,392 --> 00:07:08,392
And Maru-6.

138
00:07:08,392 --> 00:07:10,392
It's the most powerful animal.

139
00:07:10,392 --> 00:07:12,392
Is this really?

140
00:07:12,392 --> 00:07:14,392
And Maru-7.

141
00:07:14,392 --> 00:07:15,392
There are.

142
00:07:15,392 --> 00:07:17,392
It's totally irrelevant.

143
00:07:17,392 --> 00:07:20,688
Okay, these seven.

144
00:07:20,688 --> 00:07:24,688
From the top 10, please vote.

145
00:07:24,688 --> 00:07:26,688
We'll decide by voting.

146
00:07:26,688 --> 00:07:28,688
Which top 10 will we choose?

147
00:07:28,688 --> 00:07:30,688
Start voting!

148
00:07:32,688 --> 00:07:34,688
I'll do this.

149
00:07:34,688 --> 00:07:36,688
You can do it.

150
00:07:36,688 --> 00:07:38,688
It's okay.

151
00:07:38,688 --> 00:07:41,232
I did it myself.

152
00:07:41,232 --> 00:07:45,632
Who will pick it up?

153
00:07:45,632 --> 00:07:48,112
We will scream.

154
00:07:48,832 --> 00:07:51,752
Maybe nobody COagna will act.

155
00:07:51,752 --> 00:07:54,552
We can know who wrote the four with
invite number 4.

156
00:07:54,552 --> 00:07:58,052
I can see who wrote the three.

157
00:07:58,052 --> 00:08:00,212
We don't know who will do that.

158
00:08:00,212 --> 00:08:03,132
Who wrote number three is generally next
question.

159
00:08:03,432 --> 00:08:07,008
4,3,2,1

160
00:08:07,008 --> 00:08:11,008
Done!

161
00:08:11,008 --> 00:08:14,008
What's the first place?

162
00:08:14,008 --> 00:08:16,008
What do you think?

163
00:08:16,008 --> 00:08:20,008
Number 3 is 23.8% and is the first
place!

164
00:08:20,008 --> 00:08:21,008
Number 3 is...

165
00:08:21,008 --> 00:08:23,008
Who wants to take a mount?

166
00:08:23,008 --> 00:08:25,008
Number 3 wants to take a mount!

167
00:08:25,008 --> 00:08:28,368
Let's talk about the mount!

168
00:08:28,368 --> 00:08:29,368
Please!

169
00:08:29,368 --> 00:08:30,368
Thank you!

170
00:08:30,368 --> 00:08:32,368
Can I take a picture of you?

171
00:08:32,368 --> 00:08:34,368
Can I take a picture of you guys?

172
00:08:34,368 --> 00:08:35,368
Sure!

173
00:08:35,368 --> 00:08:38,368
What kind of iPhone do you guys use?

174
00:08:38,368 --> 00:08:39,368
12!

175
00:08:39,368 --> 00:08:41,368
iPhone 13 Pro!

176
00:08:41,368 --> 00:08:48,096
I'm iPhone 14!

177
00:08:48,096 --> 00:08:50,096
That's great!

178
00:08:50,096 --> 00:08:52,096
But you're still using 11.

179
00:08:52,096 --> 00:08:54,096
Stop it!

180
00:08:54,096 --> 00:08:58,096
I'm struggling with data collection.

181
00:08:58,096 --> 00:09:02,096
The more I think about it, the more I
get excited.

182
00:09:02,096 --> 00:09:04,096
Isn't that 11?

183
00:09:04,096 --> 00:09:06,096
It's still 11.

184
00:09:06,096 --> 00:09:07,920
Then it's 13.

185
00:09:07,920 --> 00:09:09,920
What is that?

186
00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:14,920
But I have a phone case and it arrived.

187
00:09:14,920 --> 00:09:16,920
Did you buy a cute one?

188
00:09:16,920 --> 00:09:18,920
But it's still 11.

189
00:09:18,920 --> 00:09:20,920
I'm sorry.

190
00:09:20,920 --> 00:09:22,920
I'm talking while tying it.

191
00:09:22,920 --> 00:09:24,920
How about you guys?

192
00:09:24,920 --> 00:09:26,920
Does anyone have a phone case?

193
00:09:26,920 --> 00:09:28,920
Does anyone have a phone case?

194
00:09:28,920 --> 00:09:31,152
I'm a pro.

195
00:09:31,152 --> 00:09:33,152
You're wearing a mount.

196
00:09:33,152 --> 00:09:34,152
Thank you.

197
00:09:34,152 --> 00:09:37,152
You're using it for a long time.

198
00:09:37,152 --> 00:09:39,152
That's right.

199
00:09:39,152 --> 00:09:40,152
I'm 13.

200
00:09:40,152 --> 00:09:43,152
I've been using it for a long time.

201
00:09:43,152 --> 00:09:45,152
I want to wear a mount.

202
00:09:46,152 --> 00:09:47,152
I'm 8.

203
00:09:47,152 --> 00:09:49,152
You're using the 14 Pro.

204
00:09:49,152 --> 00:09:52,152
I'm still 12.

205
00:09:52,152 --> 00:09:54,152
You're still 12.

206
00:09:54,152 --> 00:09:57,152
I'm using the 12 Pro.

207
00:09:57,152 --> 00:09:58,152
I'm 7.

208
00:09:58,152 --> 00:09:59,152
You have a lot.

209
00:09:59,152 --> 00:10:00,912
I'm a galaxy.

210
00:10:00,912 --> 00:10:05,792
There are not many people who are 14.

211
00:10:05,792 --> 00:10:07,792
I wonder if I can take a picture.

212
00:10:07,792 --> 00:10:09,792
I was happy.

213
00:10:13,792 --> 00:10:15,792
What is an iPhone?

214
00:10:15,792 --> 00:10:17,792
I took the latest one.

215
00:10:17,792 --> 00:10:19,792
Thank you.

216
00:10:19,792 --> 00:10:21,792
Next.

217
00:10:21,792 --> 00:10:25,792
Next.

218
00:10:25,792 --> 00:10:30,672
I'm 7.

219
00:10:30,672 --> 00:10:33,672
Please vote for us.

220
00:10:39,672 --> 00:10:41,672
3DS is a lie.

221
00:10:41,672 --> 00:10:43,672
3DS is good.

222
00:10:43,672 --> 00:10:45,672
BAMBAM BEAT is popular.

223
00:10:45,672 --> 00:10:47,672
I'm embarrassed.

224
00:10:47,672 --> 00:10:51,672
14 people are still watching.

225
00:10:51,672 --> 00:10:54,672
9 people are still watching.

226
00:10:55,672 --> 00:10:57,672
9 people are still watching.

227
00:10:57,672 --> 00:10:58,608
Please vote for us.

228
00:10:58,608 --> 00:11:09,608
5, 4, 3, 2, 1, end!

229
00:11:10,176 --> 00:11:13,176
I'm curious about this.

230
00:11:13,176 --> 00:11:14,176
What's the result?

231
00:11:14,176 --> 00:11:15,176
I'm guessing.

232
00:11:15,176 --> 00:11:18,176
1st place is 19.6% and 1st place is...

233
00:11:18,176 --> 00:11:21,176
1st place! This is the only one.

234
00:11:21,176 --> 00:11:23,176
New members are announced.

235
00:11:23,176 --> 00:11:25,176
Should we talk about it?

236
00:11:25,176 --> 00:11:26,176
Let's talk about it together.

237
00:11:26,176 --> 00:11:29,176
On October 1st,

238
00:11:29,176 --> 00:11:32,176
New members were announced on the live
stream.

239
00:11:32,176 --> 00:11:33,176
Emma and Yuna.

240
00:11:33,176 --> 00:11:36,176
Number 16 is Sakurai Emma.

241
00:11:36,176 --> 00:11:39,600
Number 17 is Yuna Nakamura.

242
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:42,600
I'm not in the group.

243
00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:44,600
I'm not in the group either.

244
00:11:44,600 --> 00:11:46,600
Everyone here is 15 years old.

245
00:11:46,600 --> 00:11:48,600
I'm 17 years old.

246
00:11:48,600 --> 00:11:52,600
There are a lot of people who want to
have a 07 unit.

247
00:11:52,600 --> 00:11:58,176
And Yuna and Emma are 07 units.

248
00:11:58,176 --> 00:12:00,176
But it's different from the school year.

249
00:12:00,176 --> 00:12:02,176
Yeah, it's different.

250
00:12:02,176 --> 00:12:04,176
But it's 2007.

251
00:12:04,176 --> 00:12:06,176
Then I'm the only one left.

252
00:12:06,176 --> 00:12:08,176
What year are you?

253
00:12:08,176 --> 00:12:10,176
05.

254
00:12:10,176 --> 00:12:12,176
7.

255
00:12:12,176 --> 00:12:14,176
I've been taking the same thing for a
while.

256
00:12:14,176 --> 00:12:16,896
But...

257
00:12:16,896 --> 00:12:19,896
You two are from the same region, right?

258
00:12:19,896 --> 00:12:21,896
So I'm from the same region, too.

259
00:12:21,896 --> 00:12:23,896
I felt the same smell.

260
00:12:23,896 --> 00:12:27,896
I think Yuna is having a hard time in
Fukuoka.

261
00:12:27,896 --> 00:12:30,896
We haven't talked much yet.

262
00:12:30,896 --> 00:12:33,896
I wonder what you two are saying.

263
00:12:33,896 --> 00:12:36,896
It was fluffy and cute.

264
00:12:36,896 --> 00:12:40,896
I remember when Yuna and the others just
got in.

265
00:12:40,896 --> 00:12:40,992
Please subscribe to our channel.

266
00:12:40,992 --> 00:12:44,992
We are changing year by year.

267
00:12:44,992 --> 00:12:49,200
We are changing year by year.

268
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:51,200
I'm looking forward to it.

269
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:53,200
I wonder what will happen.

270
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:57,200
It will be a 10-person live.

271
00:12:57,200 --> 00:12:59,200
I wonder if the lessons have already
started.

272
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:01,200
It's starting now.

273
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:07,200
We haven't been able to participate in
various work.

274
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:13,200
I want to go to the lesson with Hinata
and the teacher.

275
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:17,200
I wonder.

276
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:17,232
I'm looking forward to it.

277
00:13:17,232 --> 00:13:25,680
Oh, I've got a ticket. Thank you. Thank
you. The 17th and 16th tickets are
already on the way.

278
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:28,400
Sakuragi and Sakurai are similar.

279
00:13:28,400 --> 00:13:30,400
Yes, they are.

280
00:13:30,400 --> 00:13:34,400
Mayu-san is calling Yuna, but I think
Yuna is wrong.

281
00:13:34,400 --> 00:13:40,400
So when she's angry, I think it's Yuna.

282
00:13:40,400 --> 00:13:42,400
No, no, no.

283
00:13:42,400 --> 00:13:44,400
That's my feeling.

284
00:13:44,400 --> 00:13:46,400
When I can't hear it.

285
00:13:46,400 --> 00:13:48,400
I don't know because it's Yuna and Yuna.

286
00:13:48,400 --> 00:13:52,400
So when I'm praised, it's usually Yuna.

287
00:13:52,400 --> 00:13:56,400
Because she's so cute.

288
00:13:56,400 --> 00:14:00,400
Nakayama and Nakamaya are similar.

289
00:14:00,400 --> 00:14:02,400
Yes, they are.

290
00:14:02,400 --> 00:14:06,400
From now on, we'll have dance lessons.

291
00:14:06,400 --> 00:14:08,400
I wonder how it will be.

292
00:14:08,400 --> 00:14:12,400
We may come to the showroom again.

293
00:14:12,400 --> 00:14:16,400
We'll see when they come.

294
00:14:16,400 --> 00:14:18,400
I want to do it.

295
00:14:18,400 --> 00:14:21,072
Shall we go to the next one?

296
00:14:21,072 --> 00:14:25,072
We will choose from 7 people and vote.

297
00:14:25,072 --> 00:14:27,072
Ready, start!

298
00:14:30,072 --> 00:14:32,072
Is it started?

299
00:14:32,072 --> 00:14:34,072
My ears are falling.

300
00:14:34,072 --> 00:14:36,072
Is it mostly YUNO who gets angry?

301
00:14:36,072 --> 00:14:40,072
Yes, it's usually YUNO who gets angry,
so it's not YUNA.

302
00:14:40,072 --> 00:14:41,072
That's right.

303
00:14:41,072 --> 00:14:42,072
Because you are the senior.

304
00:14:42,072 --> 00:14:43,072
Yes, yes.

305
00:14:43,072 --> 00:14:46,072
How do you feel to be the senior in a
year?

306
00:14:46,072 --> 00:14:48,480
Not really.

307
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:50,480
何か? 何かは...

308
00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:52,480
見せてください。

309
00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:57,480
何かは、あんまり分からない言葉だけなんです。

310
00:14:57,480 --> 00:15:00,480
でも一年で学んだことって絶対大きいじゃん。

311
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:02,480
学んだことは知られるといいね。

312
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:08,480
5,4,3,2,1

313
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:10,480
終了!

314
00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:12,480
見てみましょう。

315
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:14,928
気になる。どうだろう?

316
00:15:14,928 --> 00:15:17,928
1st place! 23.1% is 5th place!

317
00:15:17,928 --> 00:15:18,928
5th place!

318
00:15:18,928 --> 00:15:20,928
5th place is important.

319
00:15:20,928 --> 00:15:21,928
This is important.

320
00:15:21,928 --> 00:15:24,928
I've been thinking about this for a long
time.

321
00:15:24,928 --> 00:15:26,928
What's wrong, Nogaka-chan?

322
00:15:26,928 --> 00:15:28,928
What's wrong?

323
00:15:28,928 --> 00:15:32,928
Next time, we'll have a nabe party.

324
00:15:32,928 --> 00:15:34,928
Yes, the three of us.

325
00:15:34,928 --> 00:15:36,928
We'll have a nabe party, but...

326
00:15:36,928 --> 00:15:40,928
What kind of nabe party are we going to
do?

327
00:15:40,928 --> 00:15:42,928
I'm thinking about it a lot.

328
00:15:42,928 --> 00:15:43,536
I'm thinking about it a lot.

329
00:15:43,536 --> 00:15:45,536
What should we do? I'm always thinking
about it.

330
00:15:45,536 --> 00:15:47,536
We haven't decided on the ingredients
yet.

331
00:15:47,536 --> 00:15:49,536
We haven't decided what nabe we're going
to make.

332
00:15:49,536 --> 00:15:51,536
It's a terrible idea.

333
00:15:51,536 --> 00:15:53,536
We might not be able to do it in the
first place.

334
00:15:53,536 --> 00:15:55,536
What should we make?

335
00:15:55,536 --> 00:15:57,536
I don't like yaminame.

336
00:15:57,536 --> 00:15:59,536
I don't like yaminame.

337
00:15:59,536 --> 00:16:01,536
We're going to make a real nabe party,
not a joke.

338
00:16:01,536 --> 00:16:03,536
We're going to make a real nabe party.

339
00:16:03,536 --> 00:16:04,704
We're going to make a real nabe party.

340
00:16:04,704 --> 00:16:06,704
We're going to do it together.

341
00:16:06,704 --> 00:16:08,704
We're going to eat proper food for the
first time.

342
00:16:08,704 --> 00:16:11,704
I'm looking forward to it, but I don't
know which nabe to make.

343
00:16:11,704 --> 00:16:14,704
Please recommend a nabe to us.

344
00:16:14,704 --> 00:16:16,704
It's a problem.

345
00:16:16,704 --> 00:16:18,704
There are a lot of yam nabe.

346
00:16:18,704 --> 00:16:20,704
I don't like yam nabe.

347
00:16:20,704 --> 00:16:22,704
I want to try it on a project.

348
00:16:22,704 --> 00:16:24,704
I want to make it myself.

349
00:16:24,704 --> 00:16:26,704
Cheese fondue? Cheese fondue is a nabe?

350
00:16:26,704 --> 00:16:29,808
It's not a nabe.

351
00:16:29,808 --> 00:16:31,808
There's a strawberry nabe.

352
00:16:31,808 --> 00:16:33,808
Kimchi nabe?

353
00:16:33,808 --> 00:16:35,808
I don't like kimchi nabe.

354
00:16:35,808 --> 00:16:37,808
Is it spicy?

355
00:16:37,808 --> 00:16:40,808
Kimchi nabe has a unique smell.

356
00:16:40,808 --> 00:16:42,808
I like it.

357
00:16:42,808 --> 00:16:45,808
It's a sesame soy milk nabe.

358
00:16:45,808 --> 00:16:48,808
What do you like?

359
00:16:48,808 --> 00:16:50,808
I like chanko.

360
00:16:50,808 --> 00:16:53,808
I like motunabe and oden.

361
00:16:53,808 --> 00:16:55,808
I like sukiyaki.

362
00:16:55,808 --> 00:16:56,160
Please subscribe to my channel.

363
00:16:56,160 --> 00:16:58,160
I want to eat lettuce.

364
00:16:58,160 --> 00:17:04,160
I want to eat bean sprouts.

365
00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:08,160
Please try this dish.

366
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:10,160
Please try Chinese hot pot.

367
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:13,160
I don't think Chinese hot pot is good
with lettuce.

368
00:17:13,160 --> 00:17:16,176
I want to eat Chinese hot pot.

369
00:17:16,176 --> 00:17:18,176
I don't know what it means.

370
00:17:18,176 --> 00:17:20,176
Shabu-shabu!

371
00:17:20,176 --> 00:17:22,176
Shabu-shabu sounds good.

372
00:17:22,176 --> 00:17:24,176
Is it okay to decide so easily?

373
00:17:24,176 --> 00:17:26,176
It's too fast.

374
00:17:26,176 --> 00:17:28,176
What do you want to eat at the three-
storied house?

375
00:17:28,176 --> 00:17:30,176
This?

376
00:17:32,176 --> 00:17:34,176
This one?

377
00:17:34,176 --> 00:17:36,176
I'll choose this one.

378
00:17:36,176 --> 00:17:38,176
I'll choose shabu-shabu.

379
00:17:38,176 --> 00:17:44,176
Please write shabu-shabu in a big way.

380
00:17:45,338 --> 00:17:47,338
And there's a tomato pot.

381
00:17:47,338 --> 00:17:49,338
Tomato pot? Is it good?

382
00:17:49,338 --> 00:17:51,338
I like tomato pot.

383
00:17:51,338 --> 00:17:53,338
Tomato is better.

384
00:17:53,338 --> 00:17:55,338
Tomato is better.

385
00:17:55,338 --> 00:17:57,338
Tomato is not lettuce.

386
00:17:57,338 --> 00:17:59,338
There's a pot.

387
00:17:59,338 --> 00:18:01,338
I want to see a pot.

388
00:18:01,338 --> 00:18:03,338
Do you want sukiyaki?

389
00:18:03,338 --> 00:18:05,338
Shabu-shabu, tomato pot, sukiyaki.

390
00:18:05,338 --> 00:18:07,338
Three.

391
00:18:07,338 --> 00:18:09,338
Let's increase it to four.

392
00:18:09,338 --> 00:18:11,338
Four?

393
00:18:11,338 --> 00:18:13,338
Four pot.

394
00:18:13,338 --> 00:18:13,824
Please watch again.

395
00:18:13,824 --> 00:18:15,824
No rice cake?

396
00:18:15,824 --> 00:18:17,824
Yes, yes.

397
00:18:17,824 --> 00:18:21,824
If you don't have a rice cake pot, you
can't eat it.

398
00:18:21,824 --> 00:18:23,824
No, I don't want to.

399
00:18:23,824 --> 00:18:25,824
Can I have these four?

400
00:18:25,824 --> 00:18:27,824
I'll make it for you.

401
00:18:27,824 --> 00:18:29,824
I'll make it for you.

402
00:18:29,824 --> 00:18:31,824
I asked you for that.

403
00:18:31,824 --> 00:18:35,824
Please vote.

404
00:18:35,824 --> 00:18:39,824
Shabu-shabu, tomato pot, sukiyaki, rice
cake pot.

405
00:18:39,824 --> 00:18:41,824
Please vote.

406
00:18:41,824 --> 00:18:43,824
Ready, start!

407
00:18:43,872 --> 00:18:46,872
Yuno's food is amazing.

408
00:18:46,872 --> 00:18:50,872
If it's a motu-nabe, Yuna-chan likes it.

409
00:18:50,872 --> 00:18:52,872
Yuna-chan.

410
00:18:52,872 --> 00:18:55,872
I called from Fukuoka.

411
00:18:55,872 --> 00:18:58,872
What's going on?

412
00:18:58,872 --> 00:19:00,872
What's going on?

413
00:19:00,872 --> 00:19:02,496
Yuna-chan.

414
00:19:02,496 --> 00:19:03,996
What I want to eat is Shabu-shabu.

415
00:19:03,996 --> 00:19:05,996
That's what you want to eat.

416
00:19:05,996 --> 00:19:07,996
That's right.

417
00:19:07,996 --> 00:19:09,996
I'm not going to eat it.

418
00:19:09,996 --> 00:19:11,996
I'm going to eat it.

419
00:19:11,996 --> 00:19:17,996
Everyone wants to eat what we want to
eat.

420
00:19:17,996 --> 00:19:20,996
Please decide what you want to eat
today.

421
00:19:20,996 --> 00:19:24,996
I went to a Shabu-shabu lettuce store in
Shibuya the other day.

422
00:19:24,996 --> 00:19:26,996
It was really good.

423
00:19:26,996 --> 00:19:32,996
There was a Japanese style Japanese food
called Wadashi.

424
00:19:32,996 --> 00:19:34,560
I went to a Japanese style Japanese food
called Wadashi.

425
00:19:34,560 --> 00:19:38,560
It was delicious because it was easy to
eat.

426
00:19:40,560 --> 00:19:44,560
5, 4, 3, 2, 1

427
00:19:45,560 --> 00:19:46,560
End

428
00:19:47,560 --> 00:19:49,560
What happened? I'll do this.

429
00:19:49,560 --> 00:19:50,560
Result open

430
00:19:51,560 --> 00:19:53,560
1,33 points

431
00:19:54,560 --> 00:19:56,560
This is definitely Yu-no.

432
00:19:56,560 --> 00:19:57,560
This is Yu-no.

433
00:19:57,560 --> 00:19:59,560
I'm looking forward to this.

434
00:19:59,560 --> 00:20:00,336
End

435
00:20:00,336 --> 00:20:06,976
What should I put in? Lettuce and bean
sprouts are a must. What do you want to
say?

436
00:20:06,976 --> 00:20:11,096
Pork belly? Pork belly is delicious.

437
00:20:11,096 --> 00:20:17,336
Pork belly and enoki mushrooms. Enoki
mushrooms are delicious.

438
00:20:17,336 --> 00:20:20,296
There are Chinese cabbage, so lettuce is
good.

439
00:20:20,296 --> 00:20:21,408
process clove

440
00:20:21,408 --> 00:20:25,408
It's delicious to cut the radish thinly.

441
00:20:25,408 --> 00:20:26,408
Tofu!

442
00:20:26,408 --> 00:20:28,408
I don't eat tofu.

443
00:20:28,408 --> 00:20:30,408
I'm sorry.

444
00:20:30,408 --> 00:20:31,408
I'm sorry.

445
00:20:31,408 --> 00:20:32,408
I don't eat tofu.

446
00:20:32,408 --> 00:20:33,408
Oyster!

447
00:20:33,408 --> 00:20:34,408
I'll put in oyster!

448
00:20:34,408 --> 00:20:35,408
Isn't it scary if you say it?

449
00:20:35,408 --> 00:20:36,408
Oyster!

450
00:20:36,408 --> 00:20:38,408
Let's think about it.

451
00:20:38,408 --> 00:20:39,408
Let's think about it.

452
00:20:39,408 --> 00:20:22,208
Chicken

453
00:20:42,408 --> 00:20:43,408
You said it.

454
00:20:43,408 --> 00:20:45,408
I like chicken.

455
00:20:45,408 --> 00:20:49,200
Boil the radish thinly and put in
oyster.

456
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:51,200
Oyster is scary.

457
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:53,200
What should we do?

458
00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:59,200
Lettuce, bean sprouts, pork belly, enoki
mushroom, radish, and vinegar.

459
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:00,200
Do you want to put it in vinegar?

460
00:21:00,200 --> 00:21:01,200
I want to put it in.

461
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:03,200
What if we put in ramen at the end?

462
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:05,200
What if we put in ramen?

463
00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:06,200
What if we put in ramen?

464
00:21:06,200 --> 00:21:08,200
If we don't use a pot, ramen won't be
delicious.

465
00:21:08,200 --> 00:21:10,200
What if we put in ramen?

466
00:21:10,200 --> 00:21:11,200
What if we put in ramen?

467
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:12,200
What if we put in ramen?

468
00:21:12,200 --> 00:21:12,432
Please subscribe to the channel.

469
00:21:12,432 --> 00:21:15,432
It's not water.

470
00:21:15,432 --> 00:21:18,432
It's water.

471
00:21:18,432 --> 00:21:21,432
I said it's water.

472
00:21:21,432 --> 00:21:24,432
We put the sauce in a separate plate and
put it on the ramen.

473
00:21:24,432 --> 00:21:27,432
We put the sauce in a separate plate and
put it on the ramen.

474
00:21:27,432 --> 00:21:30,432
It's not hot water.

475
00:21:30,432 --> 00:21:33,432
Is there a soup stock?

476
00:21:33,432 --> 00:21:35,328
It's not hot water.

477
00:21:35,328 --> 00:21:37,328
I don't like the hot water.

478
00:21:37,328 --> 00:21:39,328
Is it soup stock?

479
00:21:39,328 --> 00:21:41,328
I thought it was hot water.

480
00:21:41,328 --> 00:21:43,328
I was surprised.

481
00:21:43,328 --> 00:21:45,328
I was surprised.

482
00:21:45,328 --> 00:21:47,328
I want to eat soup stock.

483
00:21:47,328 --> 00:21:49,328
I want to eat ramen.

484
00:21:49,328 --> 00:21:51,328
I want to eat ramen.

485
00:21:51,328 --> 00:21:53,568
I want to eat ramen.

486
00:21:53,568 --> 00:21:58,568
We've decided. Thank you.

487
00:21:58,568 --> 00:22:01,568
Let's do one more. Let's do one more.

488
00:22:01,568 --> 00:22:03,568
Let's do one more. Is it the last one?

489
00:22:03,568 --> 00:22:05,568
Is it the last one? Yes.

490
00:22:05,568 --> 00:22:09,568
We'll do one more. Please vote.

491
00:22:09,568 --> 00:22:12,568
I want to put this in a good way.

492
00:22:15,568 --> 00:22:18,568
Are you voting now?

493
00:22:18,568 --> 00:22:23,472
We're voting now. Please vote.

494
00:22:23,472 --> 00:22:25,472
I want to put it on.

495
00:22:26,472 --> 00:22:30,472
You can do whatever you want.

496
00:22:31,472 --> 00:22:36,472
5, 4, 3, 2, 1.

497
00:22:36,472 --> 00:22:38,472
Sugar One.

498
00:22:40,472 --> 00:22:42,472
I think I got 4 votes.

499
00:22:42,472 --> 00:22:44,472
What's the result?

500
00:22:44,472 --> 00:22:47,472
1st place with 28.6% votes.

501
00:22:47,472 --> 00:22:48,472
1st place?

502
00:22:48,472 --> 00:22:51,696
7th place.

503
00:22:51,696 --> 00:22:53,696
Is there an alien?

504
00:22:53,696 --> 00:22:55,696
Do you want to talk about it?

505
00:22:55,696 --> 00:22:57,696
There is an alien.

506
00:22:57,696 --> 00:23:00,696
If there is an alien, I think there is a
moon.

507
00:23:00,696 --> 00:23:02,696
A moon?

508
00:23:02,696 --> 00:23:04,696
Yes, a moon.

509
00:23:04,696 --> 00:23:07,696
I've been talking about it since I was
in elementary school.

510
00:23:07,696 --> 00:23:10,696
I think there is something in the moon.

511
00:23:10,696 --> 00:23:12,696
Isn't it Orihime and Hikoboshi?

512
00:23:12,696 --> 00:23:14,696
The moon is a star, so it's different.

513
00:23:14,696 --> 00:23:16,696
I want to meet Orihime and Hikoboshi.

514
00:23:16,696 --> 00:23:18,696
Can't you meet?

515
00:23:18,696 --> 00:23:21,312
That's right.

516
00:23:21,312 --> 00:23:23,312
I want to meet.

517
00:23:23,312 --> 00:23:27,312
Are there aliens in the moon?

518
00:23:27,312 --> 00:23:29,312
I think there are aliens in the moon.

519
00:23:29,312 --> 00:23:31,312
There's a yellowish person.

520
00:23:31,312 --> 00:23:33,312
I think I'll see you if I go to space.

521
00:23:33,312 --> 00:23:37,312
If you fly into space, will you be
there?

522
00:23:37,312 --> 00:23:39,312
I think there are aliens.

523
00:23:39,312 --> 00:23:41,312
I want to meet you.

524
00:23:41,312 --> 00:23:43,312
I think there are aliens.

525
00:23:43,312 --> 00:23:44,640
I believe in all that.

526
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:52,640
I want to see aliens with big eyes like
I see on TV.

527
00:23:52,640 --> 00:23:54,640
It's Kaguya Hime.

528
00:23:54,640 --> 00:23:56,640
Is Kaguya Hime an alien?

529
00:23:56,640 --> 00:23:58,640
Isn't that Tsukijin?

530
00:23:58,640 --> 00:24:00,640
Tsukijin?

531
00:24:00,640 --> 00:24:02,640
Tsukijin?

532
00:24:02,640 --> 00:24:04,640
Tsukijin is back.

533
00:24:04,640 --> 00:24:06,640
I want to go to that world.

534
00:24:06,640 --> 00:24:08,640
Do you think there are aliens?

535
00:24:08,640 --> 00:24:11,856
If you look at it from space, you can
see that we are aliens.

536
00:24:11,856 --> 00:24:13,856
No, no, we are aliens.

537
00:24:13,856 --> 00:24:15,856
I see.

538
00:24:15,856 --> 00:24:17,856
How is it?

539
00:24:17,856 --> 00:24:19,856
There was a alien behind you, right?

540
00:24:19,856 --> 00:24:21,856
Behind Haruta?

541
00:24:21,856 --> 00:24:23,856
There was!

542
00:24:23,856 --> 00:24:25,856
There was!

543
00:24:25,856 --> 00:24:27,856
There was an alien.

544
00:24:27,856 --> 00:24:29,856
I wonder what that face is.

545
00:24:29,856 --> 00:24:31,856
I'm curious about that too.

546
00:24:31,856 --> 00:24:33,856
There must be an alien.

547
00:24:33,856 --> 00:24:35,136
Yes.

548
00:24:35,136 --> 00:24:37,136
There must be an alien.

549
00:24:37,136 --> 00:24:41,136
Is there someone who saw it?

550
00:24:41,136 --> 00:24:44,136
I've seen it in the middle school.

551
00:24:44,136 --> 00:24:47,136
I think the person who said he had seen
it is a liar.

552
00:24:47,136 --> 00:24:49,136
I don't know.

553
00:24:49,136 --> 00:24:51,136
I think there might be someone who saw
it.

554
00:24:51,136 --> 00:24:55,136
I heard that Hyuui also saw it in the
middle school.

555
00:24:55,136 --> 00:24:57,136
I saw it.

556
00:24:57,136 --> 00:24:59,136
I don't know.

557
00:24:59,136 --> 00:25:02,880
I've seen one, but I haven't seen two.

558
00:25:02,880 --> 00:25:03,880
No.

559
00:25:03,880 --> 00:25:04,880
I don't think there's any.

560
00:25:04,880 --> 00:25:05,880
I don't know.

561
00:25:06,880 --> 00:25:07,880
No lies.

562
00:25:07,880 --> 00:25:08,880
No lies.

563
00:25:08,880 --> 00:25:09,880
No lies.

564
00:25:09,880 --> 00:25:11,880
I can write where I saw it.

565
00:25:11,880 --> 00:25:12,880
Oh, yeah.

566
00:25:12,880 --> 00:25:14,880
Where I saw it, where it was, what
happened.

567
00:25:14,880 --> 00:25:16,880
Ready, go!

568
00:25:16,880 --> 00:25:17,880
Ta-da!

569
00:25:17,880 --> 00:25:19,880
You're not sitting in the middle.

570
00:25:19,880 --> 00:25:20,880
You're not sitting.

571
00:25:20,880 --> 00:25:21,880
There's someone, right?

572
00:25:21,880 --> 00:25:22,880
I'm right.

573
00:25:22,880 --> 00:25:24,880
No, there's no one.

574
00:25:24,880 --> 00:25:25,880
I can't get through.

575
00:25:25,880 --> 00:25:26,880
I can't get through.

576
00:25:26,880 --> 00:25:27,880
I can't get through.

577
00:25:27,880 --> 00:25:31,728
But, surprisingly...

578
00:25:31,728 --> 00:25:34,728
The thing that aliens are thinking about
is coconut, right?

579
00:25:34,728 --> 00:25:36,728
The thing that's flying around.

580
00:25:36,728 --> 00:25:38,728
Sometimes, they say strange things.

581
00:25:38,728 --> 00:25:40,728
Yeah, seriously.

582
00:25:40,728 --> 00:25:42,728
It's like a video.

583
00:25:42,728 --> 00:25:43,728
Okay, let's do it again.

584
00:25:43,728 --> 00:25:47,728
5, 4, 3, 2, 1.

585
00:25:47,728 --> 00:25:49,728
Oh, it's over.

586
00:25:50,728 --> 00:25:52,728
How was it?

587
00:25:52,728 --> 00:25:54,728
It's not like that.

588
00:25:54,728 --> 00:25:57,728
Where did 18.2% of people see it?

589
00:25:57,728 --> 00:25:59,728
Please write down where you saw it.

590
00:25:59,728 --> 00:26:00,192
Thank you for watching.

591
00:26:00,192 --> 00:26:08,192
何色の人がいるの? 何色でした? 何色? 気になるよね。

592
00:26:08,192 --> 00:26:12,192
何色か気になる。 宇宙人コミュニティでおにぎり買ってました。

593
00:26:12,192 --> 00:26:17,192
それは全部予定だよ。 さっき? すごいタイムリーだね。

594
00:26:19,192 --> 00:26:24,192
ゆのに不思議とだけは言われたくなかったから。 いやいや。

595
00:26:24,192 --> 00:26:29,192
えー。 気のルージュだ。 アザバシだ。 面白い。

596
00:26:29,904 --> 00:26:38,904
昨日ローソンで見た。 書くとUFOに連れ去られちゃうらしい。 あ、そうなんだ。
そんな説があるんですか?

597
00:26:38,904 --> 00:26:43,904
関東で飲んでたってめっちゃイケメンじゃん。 えー。

598
00:26:44,504 --> 00:26:47,504
えー。

599
00:26:48,024 --> 00:26:52,704
すごい。 パルツアーの楽屋にいた。 足本のやつね。

600
00:26:52,704 --> 00:26:57,664
いたね。 宇宙人しかいないエビチュウ。 確かに。 確かに。

601
00:26:57,664 --> 00:26:59,904
スマホいじってた?

602
00:26:59,904 --> 00:27:08,904
ほんとに? 見える人は見えるんじゃない? 宇宙人。
だってさ、霊的なもの見える人は見えるじゃん。 見える方は見えるよね。

603
00:27:08,904 --> 00:27:15,904
そう。 見るのだって昔君の時いたって言ってた。 怖かった。
本当部屋の時怖かったもんね。

604
00:27:15,904 --> 00:27:23,904
ちょっと薄暗い感じで。 電気消さずに。 電気消そう。 怖かった。

605
00:27:23,904 --> 00:27:29,904
まあ、まあまあまあ。 三人の背後にいるって。

606
00:27:30,144 --> 00:27:46,144
居ないじゃん。 居ないよ。 怖いの怖いから。 終わり終わり終わり終わり終わり。
違う。 ラスト質問。 何がいいかな。 可愛い犬の顔添えて。 よし、スタート。

607
00:27:51,144 --> 00:27:54,144
私だ今の。 ウォウウォって私だよ。

608
00:27:54,144 --> 00:27:58,144
撮られちゃった。 いつの間にか。

609
00:27:59,280 --> 00:28:08,280
撮ったの? 撮ったの? 撮らなかったよ。

610
00:28:08,280 --> 00:28:14,280
5,4,3,2,1,終了!

611
00:28:14,280 --> 00:28:19,280
最後のトークテーマは何でしょうか?

612
00:28:19,280 --> 00:28:21,072
気になる。

613
00:28:21,072 --> 00:28:24,072
4番! 世界一を押したい方。

614
00:28:24,072 --> 00:28:29,072
これであれですね。 三人のトークテーマは全部出してもらって。

615
00:28:29,072 --> 00:28:38,072
昨日ね、東京に帰ってきたの。
ちょっと前から愛知に帰省して、ばあちゃん家に行ったり。

616
00:28:38,072 --> 00:28:41,072
ばあちゃん家に行ったりしたんだけど、

617
00:28:41,072 --> 00:28:42,072
行ったね。

618
00:28:42,072 --> 00:28:44,112
それで、なんか。

619
00:28:44,112 --> 00:28:51,552
When I came back from Aichi, I'm not
good at eating liquid noodles, but I
can't eat something with a strong taste.

620
00:28:51,552 --> 00:28:52,992
That's good.

621
00:28:52,992 --> 00:28:57,352
And when I got home, I saw tomatoes in
the refrigerator.

622
00:28:57,352 --> 00:28:59,760
I was going to eat cucumber, but I
didn't.

623
00:28:59,760 --> 00:29:04,560
I stopped paying and ate tomatoes.

624
00:29:04,560 --> 00:29:06,760
Tomatoes are delicious when they are
sprinkled with white soup stock.

625
00:29:06,760 --> 00:29:08,160
What? White soup stock?

626
00:29:08,160 --> 00:29:10,360
Is it a big tomato?

627
00:29:10,360 --> 00:29:12,360
Big tomatoes and mini tomatoes.

628
00:29:12,360 --> 00:29:13,560
Do they go well together?

629
00:29:13,560 --> 00:29:16,160
Peel the tomatoes.

630
00:29:16,160 --> 00:29:18,560
White soup stock?

631
00:29:18,560 --> 00:29:20,160
About 2 to 1.

632
00:29:20,160 --> 00:29:21,560
Water and white soup stock.

633
00:29:21,560 --> 00:29:24,160
1 is white soup stock and 2 is water.

634
00:29:24,160 --> 00:29:25,760
And...

635
00:29:25,760 --> 00:29:25,872
Please watch again.

636
00:29:25,872 --> 00:29:27,872
It's really delicious when you eat it
with soup.

637
00:29:27,872 --> 00:29:28,872
How long do you put it on?

638
00:29:28,872 --> 00:29:29,872
About an hour.

639
00:29:29,872 --> 00:29:33,872
If you want to make it like this, you
can add more white soup stock.

640
00:29:33,872 --> 00:29:39,872
I'm tired of making it, so I cut the
tomatoes and put them in the soup.

641
00:29:39,872 --> 00:29:41,872
What does it taste like?

642
00:29:41,872 --> 00:29:43,872
It's a little delicious.

643
00:29:43,872 --> 00:29:45,872
I don't know.

644
00:29:45,872 --> 00:29:47,872
I know what's delicious.

645
00:29:47,872 --> 00:29:49,872
I know what's delicious.

646
00:29:49,872 --> 00:29:50,872
I know what's delicious.

647
00:29:50,872 --> 00:29:53,872
Tomatoes and white soup are delicious.

648
00:29:53,872 --> 00:29:59,872
I wanted to eat a little bit yesterday,
so I ate a lot of tomatoes.

649
00:30:00,672 --> 00:30:04,672
I wanted to eat a little bit more, so I
ate two big tomatoes.

650
00:30:04,672 --> 00:30:05,672
You ate both, right?

651
00:30:05,672 --> 00:30:06,672
Yes.

652
00:30:06,672 --> 00:30:09,672
I often say that I eat it with white
soup stock.

653
00:30:09,672 --> 00:30:13,672
Yes, it's delicious if you put cucumber
and white soup stock.

654
00:30:13,672 --> 00:30:15,672
You mean, the one who put the soup
stock?

655
00:30:15,672 --> 00:30:20,672
Yes, it's delicious if you put the soup
stock.

656
00:30:20,672 --> 00:30:23,136
I want to try it.

657
00:30:23,136 --> 00:30:25,136
Should we do it when we make it?

658
00:30:25,136 --> 00:30:27,136
Buy some cucumbers and tomatoes.

659
00:30:27,136 --> 00:30:29,136
Let's do it.

660
00:30:29,136 --> 00:30:31,136
That's good.

661
00:30:31,136 --> 00:30:33,136
It's over.

662
00:30:33,136 --> 00:30:35,376
It's over.

663
00:30:35,376 --> 00:30:42,376
Thank you. That's all for the fun and
fluffy survey talk.

664
00:30:42,376 --> 00:30:45,376
Next, we'll do this kind of project.

665
00:30:45,376 --> 00:30:51,376
Halloween that's too fun and fluffy and
can't be conveyed in detail.

666
00:30:51,376 --> 00:30:53,376
I'd like to explain the rules.

667
00:30:53,376 --> 00:30:56,376
It's a project that's being done every
year during the Halloween season.

668
00:30:56,376 --> 00:31:03,376
Users, please comment on the characters
that are too fine and can't be conveyed.

669
00:31:03,376 --> 00:31:06,376
We'll be the ones to do it.

670
00:31:06,376 --> 00:31:11,376
For example, someone who talks while
hiding the stain on the clothes.

671
00:31:11,376 --> 00:31:13,376
It's so detailed.

672
00:31:13,376 --> 00:31:14,376
It's interesting.

673
00:31:14,376 --> 00:31:15,376
Have you done it?

674
00:31:15,376 --> 00:31:18,376
Yuna and Nanoka are the same.

675
00:31:18,376 --> 00:31:20,376
I think it's Nakafo and Hinata.

676
00:31:20,376 --> 00:31:22,376
That's right.

677
00:31:22,376 --> 00:31:23,376
I think it's about the same.

678
00:31:23,376 --> 00:31:24,376
Did you get it?

679
00:31:24,376 --> 00:31:24,528
Thank you for your viewing.

680
00:31:24,528 --> 00:31:29,648
It was surprisingly difficult. It's
difficult. Let's do our best and get it
right.

681
00:31:29,648 --> 00:31:34,048
Let's get it right. We'll pick a
character from your comments.

682
00:31:34,048 --> 00:31:37,088
Please write it in the comments.

683
00:31:37,088 --> 00:31:39,888
Who will go first?

684
00:31:39,888 --> 00:31:42,288
Nono, Yua, and Kokona.

685
00:31:42,288 --> 00:31:45,248
Senpai, please. I'll go first.

686
00:31:45,248 --> 00:31:50,064
Please leave your comments.

687
00:31:50,064 --> 00:31:52,064
I can't look at it?

688
00:31:52,064 --> 00:31:54,064
No, you can look at it.

689
00:31:54,064 --> 00:31:56,064
It's hard to comment.

690
00:31:56,064 --> 00:31:57,064
Right?

691
00:31:57,064 --> 00:31:59,064
It's hard to comment.

692
00:32:00,064 --> 00:32:02,064
Oh, I can't say the heart.

693
00:32:03,064 --> 00:32:05,064
Then, please choose one.

694
00:32:05,064 --> 00:32:07,064
Can you see it?

695
00:32:07,064 --> 00:32:08,064
Can I leave it?

696
00:32:08,064 --> 00:32:09,064
Did you choose?

697
00:32:09,064 --> 00:32:10,064
Yes.

698
00:32:10,064 --> 00:32:12,064
Shall we start?

699
00:32:12,064 --> 00:32:13,064
Yes.

700
00:32:13,064 --> 00:32:19,418
I'm starting.

701
00:32:19,418 --> 00:32:21,418
Who is it?

702
00:32:21,418 --> 00:32:24,418
This is the person who didn't get
disinfected in front of the store.

703
00:32:27,418 --> 00:32:29,418
It's pretty embarrassing.

704
00:32:29,418 --> 00:32:33,418
I'm going to get a body temperature
measured with disinfection.

705
00:32:33,418 --> 00:32:35,418
Your eyes are a little real.

706
00:32:37,418 --> 00:32:39,418
I don't want to go through it as it is.

707
00:32:39,418 --> 00:32:41,418
It's a little uncomfortable.

708
00:32:41,418 --> 00:32:43,418
I'm going to write a note.

709
00:32:43,418 --> 00:32:44,016
Thank you for your viewing.

710
00:32:44,016 --> 00:32:46,016
Let's start.

711
00:32:46,016 --> 00:32:48,016
Thank you.

712
00:32:48,016 --> 00:32:50,016
Next, Yuna.

713
00:32:50,016 --> 00:32:54,016
You can start with Omomuro.

714
00:32:56,016 --> 00:32:58,016
It started.

715
00:32:58,016 --> 00:33:00,016
She's dancing.

716
00:33:00,016 --> 00:33:02,016
She's looking at us.

717
00:33:02,016 --> 00:33:04,016
What is that?

718
00:33:04,016 --> 00:33:06,016
Who is that?

719
00:33:06,016 --> 00:33:06,432
Please subscribe to my channel.

720
00:33:06,432 --> 00:33:10,432
This is the person who got a lesson from
the teacher.

721
00:33:10,432 --> 00:33:12,432
The person who was sitting behind.

722
00:33:12,432 --> 00:33:14,432
Is it a little awkward?

723
00:33:14,432 --> 00:33:19,432
I think Yu-chan and the others are
thinking that the person behind is the
one who is shaking hands.

724
00:33:19,432 --> 00:33:20,432
I agree.

725
00:33:20,432 --> 00:33:23,432
If you think you have eyes, please think
you have eyes.

726
00:33:23,432 --> 00:33:24,432
That's right.

727
00:33:24,432 --> 00:33:25,432
It's not a misunderstanding.

728
00:33:25,432 --> 00:33:26,432
It's fun.

729
00:33:27,432 --> 00:33:30,432
Then, I will go with this.

730
00:33:30,432 --> 00:33:32,432
Everyone, please.

731
00:33:32,432 --> 00:33:36,096
You can start right away.

732
00:33:36,096 --> 00:33:38,096
I can't open it.

733
00:33:38,096 --> 00:33:40,096
What are you doing?

734
00:33:40,096 --> 00:33:42,096
Wait a minute.

735
00:33:42,096 --> 00:33:46,156
The

736
00:33:46,156 --> 00:33:48,156
door is locked.

737
00:33:48,156 --> 00:33:50,156
I'm starting.

738
00:33:50,156 --> 00:33:52,156
Do you have something?

739
00:33:52,156 --> 00:33:54,156
Who are you?

740
00:33:54,156 --> 00:33:58,156
I passed the opening with a bottle of
water.

741
00:33:58,156 --> 00:34:00,156
I was actually a watermelon.

742
00:34:00,156 --> 00:34:02,156
That's Mirei.

743
00:34:02,156 --> 00:34:02,352
I'm sorry.

744
00:34:02,352 --> 00:34:06,352
Mirei tweeted about this.

745
00:34:06,352 --> 00:34:08,352
Mirei tweeted about this.

746
00:34:08,352 --> 00:34:10,352
Is that true?

747
00:34:10,352 --> 00:34:12,352
The bottle is different in shape.

748
00:34:12,352 --> 00:34:14,352
It's totally different.

749
00:34:14,352 --> 00:34:16,352
You must be tired.

750
00:34:18,352 --> 00:34:20,352
Let's do it again.

751
00:34:20,352 --> 00:34:22,352
Let's do it again.

752
00:34:24,352 --> 00:34:26,352
Which one do you want?

753
00:34:28,352 --> 00:34:30,352
Are you going to start?

754
00:34:30,352 --> 00:34:31,776
How is it?

755
00:34:31,776 --> 00:34:33,776
What should we do?

756
00:34:33,776 --> 00:34:38,776
There are many comments.

757
00:34:38,776 --> 00:34:52,442
There are things you can't take out if
you put an IC card in your bag.

758
00:34:52,442 --> 00:34:54,442
I'm looking at the back.

759
00:34:59,442 --> 00:35:01,442
Who are you?

760
00:35:01,442 --> 00:35:04,442
I'm a person who can't hear from one ear
to the other.

761
00:35:04,442 --> 00:35:09,888
I understand.

762
00:35:09,888 --> 00:35:11,888
I'm scared sometimes.

763
00:35:11,888 --> 00:35:13,888
I'm scared sometimes.

764
00:35:13,888 --> 00:35:15,888
I'm scared of not being able to hear the
sound.

765
00:35:15,888 --> 00:35:17,888
I'm scared of not being able to hear the
sound.

766
00:35:17,888 --> 00:35:19,888
I'm scared.

767
00:35:21,888 --> 00:35:23,888
Shall we move on?

768
00:35:23,888 --> 00:35:25,888
Yorokchan.

769
00:35:29,888 --> 00:35:31,888
What should I do?

770
00:35:31,888 --> 00:35:33,888
There are many comments.

771
00:35:33,888 --> 00:35:37,850
There are many comments.

772
00:35:37,850 --> 00:35:39,850
How is it?

773
00:35:39,850 --> 00:35:41,850
I'll go with this one.

774
00:35:41,850 --> 00:35:43,850
Okay.

775
00:35:49,850 --> 00:35:51,850
Who are you?

776
00:35:51,850 --> 00:35:55,850
I'm the woman who mistook ZEP diversity
for ZEP wings.

777
00:35:58,850 --> 00:36:00,850
There she is!

778
00:36:00,850 --> 00:36:02,850
There she is!

779
00:36:02,850 --> 00:36:04,850
There she is!

780
00:36:04,850 --> 00:36:05,040
Thank you for watching!

781
00:36:05,040 --> 00:36:07,040
I was like, I'm gonna get all the
comments!

782
00:36:07,040 --> 00:36:09,040
I was so excited!

783
00:36:09,040 --> 00:36:11,040
I was so excited!

784
00:36:11,040 --> 00:36:13,040
You're so annoying, Yuno-san.

785
00:36:15,040 --> 00:36:17,040
You're so annoying.

786
00:36:17,040 --> 00:36:19,040
Are you watching this?

787
00:36:19,040 --> 00:36:21,040
I am.

788
00:36:21,040 --> 00:36:23,040
You'll get mad if you watch this.

789
00:36:23,040 --> 00:36:25,040
Please leave comments.

790
00:36:25,040 --> 00:36:27,040
Is there anything?

791
00:36:27,040 --> 00:36:30,432
I'm watching.

792
00:36:30,432 --> 00:36:33,432
Who are you?

793
00:36:33,432 --> 00:36:37,432
I was about to close the elevator, but I
got in late and got in.

794
00:36:39,432 --> 00:36:41,432
This is awkward.

795
00:36:41,432 --> 00:36:44,432
And if there's someone I haven't talked
to, it's awkward.

796
00:36:46,432 --> 00:36:47,432
It's not bad, isn't it?

797
00:36:47,432 --> 00:36:49,432
I'm trying to get on it all of a sudden.

798
00:36:49,432 --> 00:36:50,432
Certainly.

799
00:36:50,432 --> 00:36:52,368
And...

800
00:36:52,368 --> 00:36:57,368
閉まった直後だって気づかないで開けたらさ
開けたって言うかボタン押したら開いちゃったって言うか

801
00:36:57,368 --> 00:36:59,368
結構行きますよ わかるわかるわかる

802
00:36:59,368 --> 00:37:02,368
混んでてね 自分にしようと思ったらね 開いちゃうんだよね

803
00:37:02,368 --> 00:37:04,368
行きますね

804
00:37:04,368 --> 00:37:12,218
はい ラスト1回行きます 行きますね

805
00:37:12,218 --> 00:37:14,218
It's starting.

806
00:37:14,218 --> 00:37:16,218
It's starting.

807
00:37:16,218 --> 00:37:18,218
It's a bit rough.

808
00:37:18,218 --> 00:37:20,218
Who are you?

809
00:37:20,218 --> 00:37:22,218
I'm the one who dropped my contact lens.

810
00:37:22,218 --> 00:37:24,218
Oh, really?

811
00:37:24,218 --> 00:37:26,218
What do you mean?

812
00:37:26,218 --> 00:37:30,218
You open it, try to make contact, and
then put it on.

813
00:37:30,218 --> 00:37:32,218
If you blink, it will fall.

814
00:37:32,218 --> 00:37:34,218
You can't put it on properly.

815
00:37:34,218 --> 00:37:36,218
I think people who are in contact will
understand.

816
00:37:36,218 --> 00:37:38,218
Oh, that's it.

817
00:37:38,218 --> 00:37:40,218
That's interesting.

818
00:37:40,218 --> 00:37:40,272
Thank you for your viewing.

819
00:37:40,272 --> 00:37:43,272
It's hard to find.

820
00:37:43,272 --> 00:37:45,272
The color is different.

821
00:37:45,272 --> 00:37:47,272
It's usually light blue.

822
00:37:49,272 --> 00:37:51,272
It's hard to find.

823
00:37:51,272 --> 00:37:53,272
It's the last turn.

824
00:37:53,272 --> 00:37:55,272
Is it over?

825
00:37:55,272 --> 00:37:57,272
Last turn?

826
00:37:57,272 --> 00:38:05,272
There are many.

827
00:38:09,984 --> 00:38:11,984
Something is going on.

828
00:38:11,984 --> 00:38:13,984
Who are you?

829
00:38:13,984 --> 00:38:15,984
Who are you?

830
00:38:15,984 --> 00:38:21,984
I'm the type of person who steps when I
feel like I'm being pushed by my hands.

831
00:38:21,984 --> 00:38:23,984
That's a bit embarrassing.

832
00:38:23,984 --> 00:38:25,984
It's common these days.

833
00:38:25,984 --> 00:38:27,984
You don't go at all.

834
00:38:27,984 --> 00:38:29,984
I know.

835
00:38:29,984 --> 00:38:31,984
It's very convenient for your feet.

836
00:38:31,984 --> 00:38:33,984
If you think you're pushing your
hands...

837
00:38:33,984 --> 00:38:35,984
Something is going on.

838
00:38:35,984 --> 00:38:37,984
Are you singing?

839
00:38:37,984 --> 00:38:38,016
I'm sorry.

840
00:38:38,016 --> 00:38:40,016
Oh, it's not working.

841
00:38:41,136 --> 00:38:43,136
Who are you?

842
00:38:43,136 --> 00:38:47,136
I'm a person who cancels because I'm too
tall in karaoke.

843
00:38:48,136 --> 00:38:50,136
That's a good thing.

844
00:38:50,136 --> 00:38:53,136
I'm not the one who sang it.

845
00:38:53,136 --> 00:38:57,136
It's a little embarrassing when I go to
karaoke alone.

846
00:38:57,136 --> 00:38:59,136
Have you ever done karaoke alone?

847
00:38:59,136 --> 00:39:00,136
I have.

848
00:39:00,136 --> 00:39:02,136
I've used it in practice.

849
00:39:02,136 --> 00:39:03,136
What about you?

850
00:39:03,136 --> 00:39:04,136
I don't have it.

851
00:39:04,136 --> 00:39:07,136
I don't go to karaoke in the first
place.

852
00:39:07,136 --> 00:39:11,136
I think I can do it.

853
00:39:11,136 --> 00:39:17,136
I can't sing a song of a male artist
because it's too low.

854
00:39:17,136 --> 00:39:20,688
I can't sing because the chorus is too
high.

855
00:39:20,688 --> 00:39:22,688
That's why it's canceled.

856
00:39:22,688 --> 00:39:24,688
It's a little embarrassing.

857
00:39:24,688 --> 00:39:26,688
I know. Thank you very much.

858
00:39:26,688 --> 00:39:28,688
Thank you for your comments.

859
00:39:28,688 --> 00:39:29,688
Thank you very much.

860
00:39:29,688 --> 00:39:31,688
It's over. Thank you very much.

861
00:39:31,688 --> 00:39:32,688
Thank you very much.

862
00:39:32,688 --> 00:39:36,688
That was Halloween that can't be
conveyed in detail.

863
00:39:38,688 --> 00:39:43,688
Now, the 50th episode of the showroom in
the middle of the show is about to end.

864
00:39:43,688 --> 00:39:44,688
Yes.

865
00:39:44,688 --> 00:39:46,688
Do you want to announce it?

866
00:39:46,688 --> 00:39:48,688
Yes, I will announce it.

867
00:39:48,688 --> 00:39:49,688
Please.

868
00:39:49,688 --> 00:39:50,688
Where is it?

869
00:39:50,784 --> 00:39:51,784
Where is it?

870
00:39:51,784 --> 00:39:52,784
Please come here.

871
00:39:52,784 --> 00:39:54,784
Did you have fun?

872
00:39:54,784 --> 00:39:55,784
I wonder if it was fun.

873
00:39:55,784 --> 00:39:58,784
It's fun to do a live broadcast with
Gokuyo.

874
00:39:58,784 --> 00:39:59,784
It's been a while.

875
00:39:59,784 --> 00:40:00,784
It's not like that.

876
00:40:00,784 --> 00:40:02,784
It's not like that?

877
00:40:02,784 --> 00:40:03,784
It was fun.

878
00:40:03,784 --> 00:40:04,784
I'm glad.

879
00:40:04,784 --> 00:40:06,784
Thank you.

880
00:40:06,784 --> 00:40:08,016
Thank you.

881
00:40:08,016 --> 00:40:11,096
Tomorrow, October 29th,

882
00:40:11,096 --> 00:40:13,096
Riko Nakayama's birthday solo live,

883
00:40:13,096 --> 00:40:15,096
Riko Nakayama's birthday party,

884
00:40:15,096 --> 00:40:17,096
will be held at KT ZEPP Yokohama.

885
00:40:17,096 --> 00:40:18,096
Yes.

886
00:40:18,096 --> 00:40:19,096
Yes.

887
00:40:19,096 --> 00:40:20,096
Tomorrow.

888
00:40:20,096 --> 00:40:21,096
Tomorrow.

889
00:40:21,096 --> 00:40:23,096
Please enjoy it.

890
00:40:23,096 --> 00:40:24,096
Please enjoy it.

891
00:40:24,096 --> 00:40:25,096
Thank you.

892
00:40:25,096 --> 00:40:26,096
And,

893
00:40:26,096 --> 00:40:27,096
tada.

894
00:40:27,096 --> 00:40:28,096
Yes.

895
00:40:28,096 --> 00:40:29,096
10, 11, 12,

896
00:40:29,096 --> 00:40:31,096
Heisei Isokin Trio,

897
00:40:31,096 --> 00:40:31,872
will be held at KT ZEPP Yokohama.

898
00:40:31,872 --> 00:40:40,512
10, 11, 12, Heisei Isokin Trio, will be
held at Ichikawa City Cultural
Exhibition on October 30.

899
00:40:40,512 --> 00:40:43,552
Yes, it's the second part of the
Kachiyo-Agi Project.

900
00:40:43,552 --> 00:40:49,592
The second part will be held with Riko,
Kaho, and Hinata.

901
00:40:49,592 --> 00:40:50,712
Next?

902
00:40:50,712 --> 00:40:52,432
Next!

903
00:40:52,432 --> 00:40:54,632
There are a lot.

904
00:40:54,632 --> 00:40:56,352
There are a lot? I'm looking forward to
it.

905
00:40:56,352 --> 00:40:57,472
There were a lot yesterday.

906
00:40:57,472 --> 00:40:58,672

Halloween.

00:41:14,800 --> 00:41:19,800
I'm looking forward to it.

913
00:41:26,928 --> 00:41:30,128
Tachikawa Stage... Tachikawa Stage
Garden?

914
00:41:30,192 --> 00:41:33,192
Tachikawa Stage Garden!

915
00:41:33,192 --> 00:41:35,192
I'm so excited!

916
00:41:35,192 --> 00:41:40,192
We were thinking about how to set up
with Hinata-chan.

917
00:41:40,192 --> 00:41:44,192
We're thinking about it together, so I'm
looking forward to it.

918
00:41:44,192 --> 00:41:47,192
We'll do that song.

919
00:41:47,192 --> 00:41:49,192
We'll do that song.

920
00:41:49,192 --> 00:41:51,192
We'll do kanji.

921
00:41:51,192 --> 00:41:53,192
We'll try that.

922
00:41:53,192 --> 00:42:00,192
We'll do all the songs.

923
00:42:00,192 --> 00:42:02,192
I'm looking forward to it!

924
00:42:02,192 --> 00:42:07,344
We'll check the top 5 of the final
ranking.

925
00:42:07,344 --> 00:42:10,644
Let's read it.

926
00:42:11,904 --> 00:42:16,304
11th, 28th is Hinata's solo.

927
00:42:16,304 --> 00:42:19,644
Yes, 11th, 12th is the final ranking.

928
00:42:19,644 --> 00:42:20,644
Sorry.

929
00:42:20,644 --> 00:42:22,844
We'll read it again.

930
00:42:22,844 --> 00:42:26,844
Let's check the ranking first.

931
00:42:26,844 --> 00:42:28,044
Ranking.

932
00:42:28,044 --> 00:42:33,044
Ranking 5, Riku. Thank you.

933
00:42:33,044 --> 00:42:33,312
Ranking 5, Hinata. Thank you.

934
00:42:33,312 --> 00:42:37,312

00:42:51,312 --> 00:42:55,312
1位 ペンペンさん. Thank you.

939
00:42:55,312 --> 00:42:57,312
We've changed the topic.

940
00:42:57,312 --> 00:42:59,312
Yes, we've changed the topic.

941
00:42:59,312 --> 00:42:59,952
We'll say it again.

942
00:42:59,952 --> 00:43:07,952
The 13th, 14th, 15th and 15th members
will be performing at the stage garden
on November 12th.

943
00:43:07,952 --> 00:43:08,952
Yes!

944
00:43:08,952 --> 00:43:10,952
We've changed the time.

945
00:43:10,952 --> 00:43:13,056
Please come to the stage garden!

946
00:43:13,056 --> 00:43:15,056
Please watch the live broadcast!

947
00:43:15,056 --> 00:43:20,056
So, the 50th episode of the fun and
fluffy showroom in Ebichu is over!

948
00:43:20,056 --> 00:43:22,056
Thank you!

949
00:43:22,056 --> 00:43:25,056
We will announce the next episode again
later.

950
00:43:25,056 --> 00:43:31,056
This live broadcast will be broadcasted
after this, so please check it out!

951
00:43:31,056 --> 00:43:36,056
The live broadcast will end for now, but
we will be back soon, so please wait for
it!

952
00:43:36,056 --> 00:43:41,520
Please leave a comment if you have
anything you want us to say in the
comment section!

953
00:43:41,520 --> 00:43:43,520
That's it for today!

954
00:43:43,520 --> 00:43:41,880
This was Shin-Ai Shin-Ai's shrimp

955
00:43:41,880 --> 00:43:43,520
This was Shin-Ai Shin-Ai's shrimp

956
00:43:43,520 --> 00:43:45,520
shrimp school!

957
00:43:45,520 --> 00:43:47,520
Bye bye!

958
00:43:47,520 --> 00:43:49,520
Thank you!

959
00:43:49,520 --> 00:44:16,520
Bye!

960
00:44:16,634 --> 00:44:18,634
The live performance has been decided.

961
00:44:18,634 --> 00:44:20,634
I'm looking forward to it.

962
00:44:20,634 --> 00:44:24,634
We have only a few more times to do a
live performance with Hina.

963
00:44:24,634 --> 00:44:26,634
We said we have only five more times.

964
00:44:26,634 --> 00:44:32,634
No, we have six more times to do a live
performance with the last voice.

965
00:44:32,634 --> 00:44:34,634
That's right.

966
00:44:34,634 --> 00:44:36,634
It's started.

967
00:44:36,634 --> 00:44:38,634
Thank you.

968
00:44:38,634 --> 00:44:39,024
Let's do it again.

969
00:44:39,024 --> 00:44:41,024
How was it?

970
00:44:41,024 --> 00:44:43,024
What was the answer?

971
00:44:43,024 --> 00:44:45,024
I think it was fun.

972
00:44:45,024 --> 00:44:47,024
I forgot to say one thing.

973
00:44:47,024 --> 00:44:49,024
Today,

974
00:44:49,024 --> 00:44:51,024
on Fuji TV2,

975
00:44:51,024 --> 00:44:55,024
our fanmeeting will be broadcasted.

976
00:44:55,024 --> 00:44:57,024
Please watch it.

977
00:44:57,024 --> 00:44:59,024
Thank you for your hard work.

978
00:44:59,024 --> 00:45:01,024
From 20 o'clock.

979
00:45:01,024 --> 00:45:05,024
Yes, the fanmeeting will be broadcasted
on Fuji TV2.

980
00:45:05,024 --> 00:45:06,288
Bye.

981
00:45:06,288 --> 00:45:08,288
Can you tell us about the highlights?

982
00:45:08,288 --> 00:45:10,288
The highlights?

983
00:45:10,288 --> 00:45:14,288
The first fan meeting, Hanami and Mizu.

984
00:45:14,288 --> 00:45:16,288
It was the first time.

985
00:45:16,288 --> 00:45:18,288
We were having fun.

986
00:45:18,288 --> 00:45:20,288
The first three of us.

987
00:45:20,288 --> 00:45:22,288
We were having fun.

988
00:45:22,288 --> 00:45:27,288
All the members were having fun.

989
00:45:27,288 --> 00:45:29,288
It was really fun.

990
00:45:29,288 --> 00:45:30,288
It was fun.

991
00:45:30,288 --> 00:45:34,288
Kaho was on vacation, so it was the
first fan meeting.

992
00:45:34,288 --> 00:45:38,288
We were having fun as much as we could.

993
00:45:38,976 --> 00:45:39,976
It was fun.

994
00:45:39,976 --> 00:45:41,976
I was surprised to see that much water.

995
00:45:41,976 --> 00:45:42,976
It was raining.

996
00:45:42,976 --> 00:45:44,976
Yes, it was raining.

997
00:45:44,976 --> 00:45:47,976
Please come to the concert from 10
o'clock.

998
00:45:47,976 --> 00:45:48,976
Please.

999
00:45:48,976 --> 00:45:52,976
How was the MC?

1000
00:45:52,976 --> 00:45:57,976
I always do the MC when I'm with the
members.

1001
00:45:57,976 --> 00:46:00,432
I study every day.

1002
00:46:00,432 --> 00:46:04,432
I hope I can get better and better.

1003
00:46:04,432 --> 00:46:07,432
You're so determined.

1004
00:46:07,432 --> 00:46:10,432
The stability of the MC was great.

1005
00:46:10,432 --> 00:46:12,432
Thank you.

1006
00:46:12,432 --> 00:46:13,432
As expected of the older sister.

1007
00:46:13,432 --> 00:46:14,432
Thank you.

1008
00:46:14,432 --> 00:46:16,432
I'm serious.

1009
00:46:16,432 --> 00:46:17,432
I'm not serious.

1010
00:46:17,432 --> 00:46:20,432
I feel like MCs tend to be like that.

1011
00:46:20,432 --> 00:46:21,432
Certainly.

1012
00:46:21,432 --> 00:46:25,432
I think it's great to finish as time
goes by.

1013
00:46:25,432 --> 00:46:28,368
Thank you.

1014
00:46:28,368 --> 00:46:30,368
How about you two?

1015
00:46:30,368 --> 00:46:34,368
I was really curious about Yunho.

1016
00:46:34,368 --> 00:46:36,368
Sometimes Yunho falls down.

1017
00:46:36,368 --> 00:46:38,640
Yes, he falls down when I do this.

1018
00:46:38,640 --> 00:46:40,640
I'm free!

1019
00:46:40,640 --> 00:46:42,640
I thought you were free today.

1020
00:46:42,640 --> 00:46:46,640
I'm not an MC today, so I'm free.

1021
00:46:46,640 --> 00:46:49,640
I want you to be an MC every time.

1022
00:46:49,640 --> 00:46:52,640
I want to be free from the pot.

1023
00:46:52,640 --> 00:46:56,640
I can eat a pot, but I think cabbage is
delicious.

1024
00:46:56,640 --> 00:46:59,640
I want to eat cabbage.

1025
00:46:59,640 --> 00:47:03,216
I will never give up.

1026
00:47:03,216 --> 00:47:05,896
Then you should say cabbage pot.

1027
00:47:05,896 --> 00:47:07,896
Oh, I like cabbage pot.

1028
00:47:09,896 --> 00:47:11,896
I'm not doing it while rolling it.

1029
00:47:11,896 --> 00:47:13,680
How was it?

1030
00:47:13,680 --> 00:47:19,680
I think I voted a lot today.

1031
00:47:19,680 --> 00:47:26,680
I'm glad that you have helped me a lot.

1032
00:47:26,680 --> 00:47:30,680
This is the good way to use the
showroom.

1033
00:47:30,680 --> 00:47:35,680
I didn't decide to vote here.

1034
00:47:35,680 --> 00:47:38,680
I was able to decide a lot of things.

1035
00:47:38,680 --> 00:47:42,384
I think everyone was able to
participate.

1036
00:47:42,384 --> 00:47:43,384
I'm glad.

1037
00:47:43,384 --> 00:47:44,384
Can't you hear me?

1038
00:47:44,384 --> 00:47:45,384
What?

1039
00:47:45,384 --> 00:47:46,080
I'm sorry.

1040
00:47:46,080 --> 00:47:49,080
I thought it would be okay because my
ears would fall off.

1041
00:47:49,080 --> 00:47:53,080
I'm glad I decided to make a pot.

1042
00:47:53,080 --> 00:47:55,080
I'm glad. I'm looking forward to it.

1043
00:47:55,080 --> 00:47:58,080
I'm looking forward to it.

1044
00:47:58,080 --> 00:48:05,080
It was the first showroom where the
three of us became seniors.

1045
00:48:05,080 --> 00:48:08,080
I think you've grown up.

1046
00:48:08,080 --> 00:48:11,080
I want to see it. Thank you very much.

1047
00:48:11,080 --> 00:48:14,080
I want to see the first showroom where
the three of us did it.

1048
00:48:14,080 --> 00:48:16,080
How did you do it?

1049
00:48:16,128 --> 00:48:23,128
I would have relied on my seniors if I
had more seniors.

1050
00:48:23,128 --> 00:48:34,128
But now that we're doing it together,
I'm not sure if it's Kokubo-san, but I'm
glad I felt like I was doing it
properly.

1051
00:48:34,128 --> 00:48:37,128
Thank you very much.

1052
00:48:37,128 --> 00:48:39,128
The three of you are very interesting.

1053
00:48:39,128 --> 00:48:40,128
I'm glad.

1054
00:48:40,128 --> 00:48:44,640
I've been thinking that we have a good
balance recently.

1055
00:48:44,640 --> 00:48:51,640
We've been talking about various things
at work.

1056
00:48:51,640 --> 00:48:55,640
We've been talking more about various
things.

1057
00:48:55,640 --> 00:48:58,640
I think we've been thinking about it a
lot.

1058
00:48:58,640 --> 00:49:01,640
People are asking if you want to be a
national treasure.

1059
00:49:01,640 --> 00:49:04,800
Please keep going with my way.

1060
00:49:04,800 --> 00:49:06,800
The balance is the best.

1061
00:49:06,800 --> 00:49:08,800
I'm glad it's balanced.

1062
00:49:08,800 --> 00:49:10,800
What will happen if you welcome Ayuna?

1063
00:49:10,800 --> 00:49:12,800
That's right.

1064
00:49:12,800 --> 00:49:14,800
Will you be able to broadcast with five
people?

1065
00:49:14,800 --> 00:49:16,800
I'm sure it will come.

1066
00:49:16,800 --> 00:49:18,800
I don't know what kind of character it
is yet.

1067
00:49:18,800 --> 00:49:20,800
I don't know if it's something.

1068
00:49:20,800 --> 00:49:22,800
I'm going to be with you on the radio.

1069
00:49:22,800 --> 00:49:26,800
I'm looking forward to it because I
think you'll understand it from now on.

1070
00:49:28,800 --> 00:49:30,800
Everyone is going to be adults.

1071
00:49:30,800 --> 00:49:33,360
I wonder what kind of character it is.

1072
00:49:33,360 --> 00:49:36,360
I wonder if I will be an adult.

1073
00:49:36,360 --> 00:49:40,360
I'm an adult soon.

1074
00:49:40,360 --> 00:49:44,360
You're 18 years old.

1075
00:49:44,360 --> 00:49:45,360
I'm 18 years old.

1076
00:49:45,360 --> 00:49:48,360
This is a joke.

1077
00:49:48,360 --> 00:49:51,360
This is a joke.

1078
00:49:51,360 --> 00:49:54,360
I knew it.

1079
00:49:54,360 --> 00:49:57,360
I thought it was a joke.

1080
00:49:57,360 --> 00:49:57,984
I'm an adult.

1081
00:49:57,984 --> 00:50:04,384
I'm not doing it. I'm not doing it.

1082
00:50:04,384 --> 00:50:11,904
Nonoka has been practicing Tsukkomi
recently. I love Nonoka's Tsukkomi.

1083
00:50:11,904 --> 00:50:20,112
I'm not a bear. I'm a rabbit.

1084
00:50:20,112 --> 00:50:22,112
I can do this kind of thing all the
time.

1085
00:50:22,112 --> 00:50:24,112
I like this.

1086
00:50:24,112 --> 00:50:26,112
Is this okay?

1087
00:50:26,112 --> 00:50:28,112
Kazemi-san is...

1088
00:50:28,112 --> 00:50:30,112
Kazemi!

1089
00:50:30,112 --> 00:50:31,920
Until now...

1090
00:50:31,920 --> 00:50:33,920
I was like, what is that?

1091
00:50:33,920 --> 00:50:34,920
I was really confused.

1092
00:50:34,920 --> 00:50:38,920
That was cute, too, but I thought it
would be cuter if I put it in.

1093
00:50:38,920 --> 00:50:41,920
I sometimes don't notice it and say,

1094
00:50:41,920 --> 00:50:43,920
Oh, I'm sure I'm saying something.

1095
00:50:43,920 --> 00:50:45,920
I was wondering if you were listening.

1096
00:50:45,920 --> 00:50:47,920
Sometimes, when it suddenly comes, I'm
like, huh?

1097
00:50:47,920 --> 00:50:50,920
After all, it's still not enough.

1098
00:50:50,920 --> 00:50:52,920
I'll do my best.

1099
00:50:52,920 --> 00:50:53,920
Okubo, let's do our best.

1100
00:50:53,920 --> 00:50:55,920
I'm Kokubo.

1101
00:50:55,920 --> 00:50:57,920
Kokubo!

1102
00:50:59,920 --> 00:51:01,920
Kokubo!

1103
00:51:01,920 --> 00:51:03,312
I'm scared.

1104
00:51:03,312 --> 00:51:05,312
Let's wrap it up.

1105
00:51:05,312 --> 00:51:11,312
That's all for today. Thank you very
much.

1106
00:51:11,312 --> 00:51:16,312
Thank you for your hard work.

1107
00:51:16,312 --> 00:51:18,312
It's Sunday.

1108
00:51:18,312 --> 00:51:20,312
It's Sunday.

1109
00:51:20,312 --> 00:51:23,312
We're done with our work tomorrow.

1110
00:51:23,312 --> 00:51:25,312
Let's do our best tomorrow.

1111
00:51:25,312 --> 00:51:27,312
Thank you very much.

1112
00:51:27,312 --> 00:51:29,312
Bye.

1113
00:51:29,312 --> 00:51:33,312
Thank you for your hard work. See you
again.
