00:00.000 --> 00:02.000
 The next day

00:03.000 --> 00:04.000
 Yeah!

00:04.000 --> 00:05.000
 Touch?

00:05.000 --> 00:06.000
 Yeah!

00:14.000 --> 00:18.000
 Today is the event of Touch!

00:18.000 --> 00:20.000
 Yeah!

00:20.176 --> 00:26.176
 I'm wearing a knitwear of Onie today.

00:26.176 --> 00:31.176
 I can't see it because it's damaged.

00:31.176 --> 00:33.176
 I can't see it.

00:33.176 --> 00:36.176
 There is a button here.

00:36.176 --> 00:44.176
 I took it off and put it on like a
vest.

00:44.176 --> 00:45.200
 I'm going to change it.

00:46.200 --> 00:48.200
 I'm going to show you my clothes.

00:49.200 --> 00:54.200
 I usually wear a white T-shirt, but I'm
wearing a pink one.

00:54.200 --> 01:00.200
 I'm not sure if it looks good on me.

01:01.624 --> 01:03.624
 We'll do our best for the rehearsal!

01:05.624 --> 01:06.624
 It's already over.

01:08.624 --> 01:09.624
 It's already dark.

01:09.624 --> 01:11.624
 But it's a good feeling, isn't it?

01:11.624 --> 01:12.624
 It's warm.

01:12.624 --> 01:13.624
 I can see the smoke.

01:15.624 --> 01:22.624

 She's so funny.

01:43.648 --> 01:46.648
 Who is next to us?

01:49.648 --> 01:50.648
 It's Kanami.

01:51.648 --> 01:52.648
 It's Hanako.

01:55.648 --> 01:57.648
 Today, Hanako is going to be our guest.

01:59.648 --> 02:01.648
 Will she notice us?

02:03.648 --> 02:04.648
 Hello?

02:04.648 --> 02:06.648
 What?

02:07.216 --> 02:09.216
 Hello?

02:09.216 --> 02:11.216
 Hello?

02:11.216 --> 02:13.216
 Oh!

02:13.216 --> 02:15.216
 You look like a homeless.

02:17.216 --> 02:21.216
 We are here at the LUSSBAN TV.

02:22.216 --> 02:25.216
 Today, we are going to have a talk
about

02:25.216 --> 02:27.216
 the name of the show and

02:27.216 --> 02:31.216
 the theme of today's live show.

02:31.216 --> 02:33.216
 It's called Naked Dream.

02:33.216 --> 02:34.216
 No, no, no.

02:34.216 --> 02:36.216
 What? Is this broken?

02:36.216 --> 02:36.992
 It's broken.

02:37.992 --> 02:39.992
 Please say something to break it.

02:39.992 --> 02:42.992
 I'm sorry. Please break it.

02:43.898 --> 02:45.898
 Let's say it together.

02:45.898 --> 02:47.898
 Let's say it together.

02:47.898 --> 02:49.898
 Let's say it together.

02:49.898 --> 02:51.898
 Let's say it together.

02:51.898 --> 02:53.898
 I love you!

02:55.898 --> 02:57.898
 My hands are warm.

02:59.898 --> 03:01.898
 Bye-bye.

03:01.898 --> 03:03.898
 Good morning!

03:03.898 --> 03:05.898
 It's not up.

03:05.898 --> 03:07.898
 Good morning!

03:07.898 --> 03:09.898
 It's up.

03:09.898 --> 03:11.898
 I'll upload it.

03:11.898 --> 03:13.898
 It's up.

03:15.898 --> 03:17.898
 I finished studying.

03:17.898 --> 03:19.898
 I'm good at it.

03:19.898 --> 03:21.898
 I'm good at it.

03:21.898 --> 03:23.898
 I'm good at it today.

03:23.898 --> 03:25.898
 My hands are wavering.

03:25.898 --> 03:27.898
 I want to sleep.

03:27.898 --> 03:29.898
 I want to sleep.

03:31.898 --> 03:33.898
 It wasn't sleep.

03:33.898 --> 03:35.898
 I'm sleepy.

03:37.898 --> 03:39.898
 It's live.

03:39.898 --> 03:43.898
 I'll do my best to give you a touch.

03:45.898 --> 03:47.898
 Kei-chan, please do that.

03:47.898 --> 03:49.898
 Today's eye ball.

03:53.898 --> 03:55.898
 Yes.

03:55.898 --> 03:57.898
 Touch!

03:59.898 --> 04:01.898
 Today's eye ball.

04:01.898 --> 04:03.898
 Today's eye ball.

04:05.898 --> 04:07.898
 I don't know what to do.

04:07.898 --> 04:09.898
 I'll do my best.

04:09.898 --> 04:11.898
 I want to do it.

04:13.898 --> 04:15.898
 I'll do it twice.

04:15.898 --> 04:17.898
 I'll do it twice.

04:17.898 --> 04:19.898
 I don't know.

04:19.898 --> 04:21.898
 I'll do it a lot.

04:21.898 --> 04:23.898
 Live!

04:23.898 --> 04:25.898
 Yes.

04:25.898 --> 04:27.898
 I'll do it live.

04:27.898 --> 04:29.898
 I'll do it live.

04:29.898 --> 04:31.898
 I'll do it live.

04:31.898 --> 04:33.898
 I'll do it live.

04:33.898 --> 04:35.898
 I'll do it live.

04:35.898 --> 04:37.898
 I'll do it live.

04:37.898 --> 04:38.842
 I'll do it live.

04:38.842 --> 04:40.842
 I'm going to go to the bathroom.

04:40.842 --> 04:42.842
 Bathroom?

04:42.842 --> 04:44.842
 I'm going to go to the bathroom.

04:44.842 --> 04:54.842
 Bye bye.

04:55.418 --> 04:57.078
 High-five!

04:57.078 --> 04:59.078
 High-five!

05:00.718 --> 05:01.718
 Good luck!

05:01.718 --> 05:03.718
 I'm going in!

05:03.718 --> 05:17.558
 Last training.

05:17.818 --> 05:21.418
 We will shoot are runaway paratroopers
to eliminate you

05:48.060 --> 05:52.640
 It's an electric fan filled with
cheating messages!

05:52.640 --> 05:56.500
 Yuuki and Heronsaka's проблем?

05:56.500 --> 05:57.480
 ん?

05:57.780 --> 06:05.440
 Thunder and Reckoning

06:10.440 --> 06:14.880
 I'm so excited about today's wherever
we go because we won't have any problem
with myself butwhatever

06:14.880 --> 06:16.880
 It's leaking.

06:16.880 --> 06:18.880
 What's going on?

06:18.880 --> 06:20.880
 It's leaking.

06:20.880 --> 06:22.880
 I was filming.

06:24.880 --> 06:26.880
 It's leaking.

06:26.880 --> 06:28.880
 Why?

06:28.880 --> 06:36.880
 Please subscribe to my channel.

06:37.976 --> 06:39.976
 It's leaking.

06:39.976 --> 06:40.976
 It's a carbicom.

06:40.976 --> 06:41.976
 What?

06:45.976 --> 06:46.976
 It's a carbicom.

06:46.976 --> 06:48.976
 It's not focusing.

06:48.976 --> 06:51.976
 It's not focusing.

06:53.882 --> 06:55.882
 I can't get it.

06:55.882 --> 06:56.882
 Look.

06:56.882 --> 06:57.882
 It's a mosquito.

06:58.882 --> 06:59.882
 I found it.

07:00.882 --> 07:01.882
 The camera is so beautiful.

07:03.882 --> 07:07.882
 I noticed today that there is only one
hole in the earphone of Jelly.

07:07.882 --> 07:08.882
 12 holes.

07:10.882 --> 07:11.882
 Aki, you have one too.

07:11.882 --> 07:12.882
 What?

07:14.882 --> 07:15.882
 Smile.

07:16.882 --> 07:17.882
 One.

07:17.882 --> 07:19.882
 I can't get it.

07:19.882 --> 07:20.882
 It's small.

07:20.882 --> 07:23.882
 Smiling.

07:25.690 --> 07:27.690
 I'm going to take a picture.

07:27.690 --> 07:29.690
 I'm going to take a picture.

07:29.690 --> 07:31.690
 Bye bye!

07:34.234 --> 07:36.234
 I'm not good at it.

07:37.234 --> 07:38.234
 Let's go!

07:38.234 --> 07:40.234
 We've finished the practice.

07:43.234 --> 07:44.234
 Say I love you.

07:44.234 --> 07:45.234
 Wee!

07:45.234 --> 07:46.234
 Wee!

07:46.234 --> 07:47.234
 Wee!

07:47.234 --> 07:50.992
 Thank you for watching!

07:51.992 --> 07:55.992
 I bought a different eye drops today.

07:55.992 --> 07:57.992
 I'm glad.

07:57.992 --> 07:58.992
 Are you?

07:58.992 --> 07:59.992
 Yes.

07:59.992 --> 08:02.992
 I always use eye drops.

08:02.992 --> 08:03.992
 Thank you.

08:03.992 --> 08:04.992
 I'm a dry eye.

08:04.992 --> 08:06.992
 I'm using eye drops.

08:06.992 --> 08:08.992
 I'm a complex.

08:08.992 --> 08:12.992
 I'm a dry eye.

08:13.498 --> 08:17.498
 Glasses, color, contact.

08:17.498 --> 08:19.498
 Glasses, color, contact.

08:19.498 --> 08:21.498
 What's that class?

08:21.498 --> 08:24.498
 I was asked what I do every day.

08:24.498 --> 08:26.498
 Glasses, color, contact.

08:26.498 --> 08:29.498
 I thought I had to say something to
each of you.

08:29.498 --> 08:32.498
 Glasses, color, contact.

08:32.498 --> 08:33.498
 Kabigon, Kabigon.

08:33.498 --> 08:35.498
 I heard that the action is like
Kabigon.

08:35.498 --> 08:37.498
 What is Kabigon's action?

08:37.498 --> 08:38.498
 Just eat and sleep.

08:38.498 --> 08:39.498
 Is that so?

08:39.498 --> 08:41.498
 I don't know much.

08:41.498 --> 08:46.498
 When I received the phone case of
Kabigon, I got a message that I received
it.

08:46.498 --> 08:48.498
 Did you get a message?

08:48.498 --> 08:51.498
 I wanted to say it to someone.

08:51.498 --> 08:54.498
 The home screen is a recording screen.

08:54.498 --> 08:56.498
 Kabigon is a live-streaming.

08:56.498 --> 08:58.498
 I'm addicted to it now.

08:58.498 --> 09:02.498
 It was interesting that it was not only
a case.

09:02.498 --> 09:04.498
 Is it cool?

09:04.498 --> 09:07.498
 Is it cool?

09:07.498 --> 09:11.498
 It's cool.

09:13.498 --> 09:16.498
 The wind is good.

09:16.498 --> 09:18.498
 The water is good.

09:18.498 --> 09:21.498
 The wind is good.

09:21.498 --> 09:22.498
 Stop it.

09:22.498 --> 09:24.498
 How is it?

09:25.498 --> 09:27.498
 Why don't you say anything?

09:27.498 --> 09:29.498
 Hey.

09:29.498 --> 09:34.498
 I always watch Tokibaro.

09:34.498 --> 09:37.498
 I only watch Tokibaro on YouTube.

09:37.498 --> 09:41.888
 It's hot.

09:42.888 --> 09:44.888
 I'm doing the same thing.

09:44.888 --> 09:46.888
 What about you, Hiyori?

09:47.888 --> 09:50.888
 I'll put it in my bag when I do the
same thing with Julia and Hito.

09:50.888 --> 09:52.888
 What did you do?

09:52.888 --> 09:54.888
 I don't know.

09:58.888 --> 10:00.888
 I did something with what I had.

10:05.888 --> 10:07.888
 I'll cool you down.

10:07.888 --> 10:09.888
 It's hot.

10:11.480 --> 10:12.480
 Is it right?

10:14.480 --> 10:15.480
 We have the same blood.

10:15.480 --> 10:16.480
 It's a miracle.

10:16.480 --> 10:33.402
 We have the same blood.

10:33.402 --> 10:34.402
 I want a big one.

10:34.402 --> 10:35.402
 A crane.

10:35.402 --> 10:36.402
 Yes, a crane.

10:37.402 --> 10:39.402
 I'm looking forward to your support.

10:39.402 --> 10:40.402
 Thank you.

10:41.402 --> 10:42.402
 We've got a lot of cameras.

10:42.402 --> 10:43.402
 Yes, we do.

10:43.402 --> 10:44.402
 There are so many.

10:45.402 --> 10:49.402
 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11.

10:51.402 --> 10:52.402
 Thank you.

10:54.402 --> 10:55.402
 We're going to go on stage.

10:55.402 --> 10:57.402
 We're going to go on stage.

10:57.402 --> 10:58.402
 Bye-bye.

10:58.402 --> 10:59.402
 Bye-bye.

10:59.402 --> 11:04.402
 Bye-bye.

11:04.410 --> 11:08.410
 I think it's better to use your hands.

11:08.410 --> 11:10.410
 I think I can do it.

11:10.410 --> 11:11.410
 Do you use it?

11:11.410 --> 11:13.410
 Yes, I do.

11:18.410 --> 11:20.410
 We have 20 minutes left.

11:20.410 --> 11:22.410
 We have to do it.

11:23.410 --> 11:25.410
 I'll fix it.

11:25.410 --> 11:27.642
 Thank you for watching.

11:27.642 --> 11:29.642
 It's a little cold.

11:29.642 --> 11:31.642
 But it's a little amazing.

11:31.642 --> 11:33.642
 It's a little cold.

11:33.642 --> 11:35.642
 It's a little cold.

11:35.642 --> 11:37.642
 It's scary.

11:37.642 --> 11:39.642
 It's scary.

11:39.642 --> 11:41.642
 We will do our best.

11:41.642 --> 11:43.642
 We will do our best.

11:43.642 --> 11:45.680
 Please watch our video.

11:46.680 --> 11:50.680
 The sound of a vacuum cleaner.

11:51.680 --> 11:52.680
 It's February today.

11:53.680 --> 11:54.680
 It's February today.

11:55.680 --> 11:57.680
 It's February today.

11:58.680 --> 11:59.680
 I'm sorry.

11:59.680 --> 12:02.680
 Thank you for watching.

12:03.066 --> 12:05.066
 What's the next birthday?

12:05.066 --> 12:07.066
 It's in September.

12:07.066 --> 12:09.066
 Let's say it.

12:15.066 --> 12:17.066
 It's a bit nostalgic.

12:17.066 --> 12:19.066
 I remember.

12:23.066 --> 12:25.066
 What's the next birthday?

12:25.066 --> 12:27.066
 I remember.

12:29.066 --> 12:31.066
 It's a bit hard.

12:31.066 --> 12:33.066
 We have only 15 minutes left.

12:33.066 --> 12:35.066
 Really?

12:35.066 --> 12:37.066
 20 minutes?

12:37.066 --> 12:39.066
 I think so.

12:39.066 --> 12:41.066
 It's time for me to go.

12:41.066 --> 12:43.066
 Bye.

12:43.066 --> 12:45.066
 Bye.

12:45.066 --> 12:47.066
 Please subscribe to this channel.

12:48.296 --> 12:53.296
 Today, I'm wearing pink makeup.

12:56.296 --> 13:03.296
 My eye shadow is pink, my lip color is
pink, and my blush is pink.

13:04.296 --> 13:09.296
 I've been into orange makeup for a
while, but I'm wearing pink makeup
recently.

13:10.296 --> 13:11.296
 Did you notice?

13:12.296 --> 13:14.296
 What color did you wear, Aki?

13:14.296 --> 13:16.296
 I'm wearing pink.

13:16.296 --> 13:18.296
 I heard that you said, pink day.

13:19.296 --> 13:20.296
 It's the same.

13:20.296 --> 13:22.296
 It's 5 minutes before the show starts.

13:22.296 --> 13:24.296
 I'll go to the stage.

13:24.296 --> 13:26.296
 Touch!

13:32.296 --> 13:35.296
 I'm going to do something interesting.

13:36.296 --> 13:38.296
 I'm wearing a perfume.

13:38.296 --> 13:40.296
 I'm wearing a perfume.

13:40.296 --> 13:42.296
 I'm wearing a perfume.

13:42.296 --> 13:43.808
 I'm wearing a perfume.

13:44.808 --> 13:46.808
 I'm doing a push-up.

13:47.808 --> 13:48.808
 Can you raise your leg?

13:53.808 --> 13:54.808
 Thank you.

13:55.808 --> 13:56.808
 Thank you.

13:57.808 --> 13:58.808
 I don't like it.

13:59.808 --> 14:00.808
 I don't like it.

14:01.808 --> 14:02.808
 Can you raise your leg?

14:04.808 --> 14:05.808
 I'm doing a push-up.

14:06.808 --> 14:07.808
 I don't know.

14:08.808 --> 14:09.808
 I don't know.

14:10.808 --> 14:11.808
 I'm doing a push-up.

14:11.808 --> 14:12.808
 Stop it.

14:13.808 --> 14:14.808
 You are embarrassing me.

14:14.808 --> 14:17.808
 I've never done a push-up.

14:19.994 --> 14:21.994
 I'm sorry.

14:23.994 --> 14:25.994
 I'm sorry.

14:25.994 --> 14:27.994
 I'm sorry.

14:27.994 --> 14:32.794
 Thank you for watching.

14:32.794 --> 14:34.794
 I can't do it.

14:34.794 --> 14:36.794
 I can't do it.

14:36.794 --> 14:40.794
 Today, I was doing a story time.

14:40.794 --> 14:46.794
 I opened the July cider on YouTube.

14:46.794 --> 14:48.794
 I always open the July cider on
YouTube.

14:48.794 --> 14:53.794
 I'm late to talk, so I open it at 1.5
times or 1.5 times.

14:53.794 --> 14:55.794
 July cider.

14:57.794 --> 14:59.794
 You are fast.

14:59.794 --> 15:01.794
 I can't do it.

15:01.794 --> 15:03.794
 I want to do it.

15:07.794 --> 15:09.794
 I want to do it.

15:09.794 --> 15:11.794
 You can do it.

15:11.794 --> 15:13.794
 That's good.

15:13.794 --> 15:15.794
 I'm going to watch it.

15:15.794 --> 15:17.794
 Bye-bye.

15:17.794 --> 15:20.794
 Please subscribe to our channel.

15:40.538 --> 15:42.538
 I love this so much!

15:42.538 --> 15:46.538
 I can't remember the gesture.

15:48.538 --> 15:50.538
 It's me.

15:54.538 --> 15:56.538
 4 minutes left.

15:57.538 --> 15:58.538
 The first part.

15:58.538 --> 16:05.648
 The second part.

16:06.648 --> 16:08.648
 Do you think my bangs look good today?

16:09.648 --> 16:10.648
 I don't know because it's dark.

16:10.648 --> 16:11.648
 I know.

16:11.648 --> 16:12.648
 Is it OK?

16:12.648 --> 16:13.648
 Yes.

16:15.648 --> 16:16.648
 Hello.

16:18.648 --> 16:19.648
 Everyone.

16:20.648 --> 16:21.648
 I'm Kanami.

16:21.648 --> 16:22.648
 I'm Julia.

16:22.648 --> 16:23.648
 I'm Hitoka.

16:23.648 --> 16:24.648
 I'm Haruka.

16:24.648 --> 16:25.648
 I'm Aki.

16:25.648 --> 16:26.648
 I'm Hiyori.

16:26.648 --> 16:27.648
 We are SAKIMI.

16:27.648 --> 16:28.648
 Rock on!

16:28.648 --> 16:29.648
 Thank you.

16:30.648 --> 16:31.648
 Thank you.

16:31.648 --> 16:43.648
 I'm Hitoka.

16:44.570 --> 16:45.570
 I'm not sure if I can do it.

16:45.570 --> 16:46.570
 Someone is touching me.

16:46.570 --> 16:48.570
 I want to touch everyone's heart.

16:49.570 --> 16:50.570
 The heart is here.

16:51.570 --> 16:53.570
 I'm not sure if I can do it.

16:53.570 --> 17:07.570
 I'm not sure if I can do it.

17:07.578 --> 17:09.578
 I'm a little nervous.

17:09.578 --> 17:11.578
 Are you okay?

17:15.578 --> 17:17.578
 Please.

17:27.578 --> 17:29.578
 Endless.

17:29.578 --> 17:30.578
 Endless.

17:30.578 --> 17:31.578
 Gamushara.

17:31.578 --> 17:36.578
 Gamushara.

17:36.602 --> 17:39.602
 It's like a rainbow. It's beautiful.

18:11.034 --> 18:13.034
 The second day of the concert

18:18.034 --> 18:19.034
 It's good!

18:22.034 --> 18:23.034
 It's crumpled

18:24.034 --> 18:25.034
 No way!

18:25.034 --> 18:26.034
 Do you know?

18:26.034 --> 18:27.034
 Wow!

18:30.034 --> 18:31.034
 I'm fine

18:34.034 --> 18:35.034
 My bangs

18:35.034 --> 18:39.034
 Today's bangs

18:41.034 --> 18:42.034
 It's too early

18:42.034 --> 18:44.034
 I'm surprised by the time

18:47.034 --> 18:48.034
 Let's line up

18:48.034 --> 18:49.034
 The best order of life

18:50.034 --> 18:51.034
 The best order of life

18:51.034 --> 19:02.034
 The second day of the concert

19:02.034 --> 19:04.034
 The third day of the concert

19:05.034 --> 19:06.034
 The fourth day of the concert

19:06.034 --> 19:07.642
 Thank you!

19:08.142 --> 19:10.142
 Good work

19:10.142 --> 19:15.702
 Thank you very much!

19:27.360 --> 19:29.360
 It was fun, wasn't it?

19:29.360 --> 19:32.360
 High, high, high, high, high touch!

19:34.360 --> 19:36.360
 It was fun! It was fun!

19:36.360 --> 19:38.360
 Oh, no, the water is gone.

19:38.360 --> 19:39.360
 See you!

19:39.360 --> 19:42.522
 Thank you for your hard work!

19:42.522 --> 19:44.522
 It's over!

19:44.522 --> 19:46.522
 It's over!

19:46.522 --> 19:48.522
 Thank you for your hard work!

19:48.522 --> 19:50.522
 Thank you for your hard work!

19:50.522 --> 19:52.522
 Thank you for watching!

19:52.522 --> 19:54.522
 Thank you!

19:54.522 --> 19:58.522
 It was a live that connected our
hearts.

19:58.522 --> 20:00.522
 Right?

20:00.522 --> 20:02.522
 It was connected!

20:02.522 --> 20:04.522
 It was really fun!

20:04.522 --> 20:06.522
 There were a lot of emotional songs.

20:06.522 --> 20:08.522
 I'm glad.

20:08.522 --> 20:12.522
 We were looking back on the past and
singing a miracle song.

20:12.522 --> 20:14.522
 When we were singing,

20:14.522 --> 20:16.522
 I was reminded of the old days.

20:16.522 --> 20:18.522
 It was fun to be reminded of the old
days.

20:18.522 --> 20:24.522
 I hope everyone will remember the old
days and enjoy today's live.

20:24.522 --> 20:26.522
 I'm glad.

20:26.522 --> 20:28.522
 It's over!

20:28.522 --> 20:30.522
 Thank you!

20:30.522 --> 20:32.522
 It was fun!

20:32.522 --> 20:36.522
 I'm glad that new memories are being
engraved in the old songs.

20:36.522 --> 20:44.522
 I hope that people who know Toki-chan
will make a lot of memories with
nostalgic songs.

20:44.522 --> 20:46.522
 I hope so.

20:46.522 --> 20:52.522
 Let's make a lot of exciting memories
with everyone!

20:52.522 --> 20:54.522
 Thank you!

20:54.522 --> 20:56.522
 Thank you!

20:56.522 --> 20:57.856
 See you!

20:57.856 --> 21:01.256
 Touch! Touch! Touch!

21:01.256 --> 21:05.256
 High! High! High! High! High Touch!

21:05.256 --> 21:07.256
 Bye!

21:07.256 --> 21:11.756
 Oh, Julia was filming us, so let's take
the video!

21:11.756 --> 21:13.756

21:13.756 --> 21:20.756

21:28.756 --> 21:30.756

21:32.756 --> 21:34.756
 What?

21:34.756 --> 21:36.756
 What?

21:36.756 --> 21:38.756
 Julia, give her a thumbs up!

21:38.756 --> 21:40.756
 Give her a thumbs up!

21:40.756 --> 21:42.756

22:00.756 --> 22:02.756
 Thank you!

22:02.756 --> 22:04.756
 We'll be looking for more fun videos!

22:04.756 --> 22:06.756
 That's right!

22:06.756 --> 22:10.756
 Bye!

22:12.000 --> 22:14.000
 Bye bye!

22:14.000 --> 22:16.000
 Bye bye!

22:16.000 --> 22:18.000
 Bye bye!

22:18.000 --> 22:20.000
 Bye bye!

22:20.000 --> 22:22.000
 We finished the live!

22:22.000 --> 22:24.000
 We finished!

22:24.000 --> 22:26.000
 We were able to do the live

22:26.000 --> 22:28.000
 with our hearts!

22:28.000 --> 22:30.000
 We did it!

22:30.000 --> 22:32.000
 It was so fun!

22:32.000 --> 22:34.000
 I think the makeup artist

22:34.000 --> 22:36.000
 was able to tell

22:36.000 --> 22:38.000
 that everyone was having fun!

22:38.000 --> 22:40.000
 It was so fun!

22:42.000 --> 22:44.000
 It was a fun live!

22:44.000 --> 22:46.000
 It was fun!

22:46.000 --> 22:48.000
 The beauty was the best!

22:48.000 --> 22:50.000
 Yeah, the beauty!

22:50.000 --> 22:52.000
 It was fun!

22:52.000 --> 22:54.000
 It's been a while since we did

22:54.000 --> 22:56.000
 the old song,

22:56.000 --> 22:58.000
 but did you notice

22:58.000 --> 23:00.000
 that the first part

23:00.000 --> 23:02.000
 was a little bit

23:02.000 --> 23:04.000
 like an acrobat?

23:04.000 --> 23:06.000
 That was the original form,

23:06.000 --> 23:08.000
 but we were able to shake hands

23:08.000 --> 23:10.000
 and talk a little bit,

23:10.000 --> 23:12.000
 but we went back

23:12.000 --> 23:14.000
 and did it again

23:14.000 --> 23:16.000
 in the original form.

23:16.000 --> 23:18.000
 Did you notice?

23:18.000 --> 23:20.000
 We did!

23:20.000 --> 23:22.000
 It's good to be able to do

23:22.000 --> 23:24.000
 old songs and recent songs

23:24.000 --> 23:26.000
 and shake hands

23:26.000 --> 23:28.000
 with Inagana Yui-chan!

23:28.000 --> 23:30.000
 Yeah!

23:30.000 --> 23:32.000
 It was fun!

23:32.000 --> 23:34.000
 I hope we can connect

23:34.000 --> 23:36.000
 more and more people

23:36.000 --> 23:38.000
 with our songs,

23:38.000 --> 23:40.000
 so please continue

23:40.000 --> 23:42.000
 to support us!

23:42.000 --> 23:44.000
 I hope we can meet more people!

23:44.000 --> 23:46.864
 Thank you!

23:47.864 --> 23:48.864
 What?

23:48.864 --> 23:49.864
 I don't know!

23:49.864 --> 23:50.864
 What?

23:50.864 --> 23:51.864
 What?

23:51.864 --> 23:52.864
 I don't know!

23:52.864 --> 23:53.864
 What?

23:53.864 --> 23:54.864
 I don't know!

23:54.864 --> 23:55.864
 What?

23:55.864 --> 23:56.864
 I don't know!

23:57.864 --> 23:58.864
 I don't know!

23:58.864 --> 23:59.674
 I don't know!

23:59.674 --> 24:04.674
 I respect Hitoka.

24:04.674 --> 24:06.674
 It's good.

24:06.674 --> 24:08.674
 Hitoka, you're good.

24:08.674 --> 24:10.674
 I did it.

24:10.674 --> 24:15.674
 This live is relaxing before it starts.

24:15.674 --> 24:17.674
 Hiori is excited.

24:17.674 --> 24:19.674
 Hiori is excited.

24:19.674 --> 24:20.674
 She's a little nervous.

24:20.674 --> 24:23.674
 But she's excited about today.

24:23.674 --> 24:25.674
 I don't know.

24:25.674 --> 24:28.674
 Sometimes it happens.

24:28.674 --> 24:29.674
 Sometimes it happens today.

24:29.674 --> 24:37.674
 Today, I was able to get in touch with
you.

24:37.674 --> 24:39.674
 We had eye contact.

24:39.674 --> 24:42.674
 We had eye contact a lot today.

24:42.674 --> 24:48.674
 We saw each other in places we don't
usually see.

24:48.674 --> 24:51.674
 I said it at the live.

24:51.674 --> 24:58.674
 I was singing a song.

24:58.674 --> 25:02.674
 I was looking at Hitoka and I felt her
expression.

25:02.674 --> 25:05.674
 I felt her expression when I was
looking at Hitoka.

25:05.674 --> 25:11.674
 I felt her expression when I was
looking at Hitoka.

25:11.674 --> 25:15.674
 I saw her and she was smiling.

25:15.674 --> 25:18.674
 I thought she did something.

25:18.674 --> 25:20.674
 I felt her expression.

25:20.674 --> 25:23.674
 I thought she was smiling because she
did something.

25:23.674 --> 25:25.674
 I thought she did something.

25:25.674 --> 25:27.674
 I was surprised.

25:27.674 --> 25:30.674
 I thought she was cute.

25:30.674 --> 25:33.674
 I think hearts are connected.

25:33.674 --> 25:36.674
 Heart to heart.

25:36.674 --> 25:40.674
 This live was heart to heart.

25:40.674 --> 25:43.674
 It's perfect.

25:43.674 --> 25:47.674
 It was a live that I thought was heart
to heart.

25:47.674 --> 25:52.674
 I was looking back at the old pictures.

25:52.674 --> 25:55.674
 I was emotional.

25:55.674 --> 26:02.674
 I was looking at the pictures of the
victory song.

26:02.674 --> 26:05.674
 I was looking at Hiori's face.

26:05.674 --> 26:08.674
 Stop it.

26:08.674 --> 26:10.674
 I was looking at her face.

26:10.674 --> 26:13.674
 It was a great live.

26:13.674 --> 26:16.674
 I think it was a really fun live.

26:16.674 --> 26:20.674
 I hope you think so.

26:20.674 --> 26:25.674
 Let's make a lot of memories and touch
a lot.

26:25.674 --> 26:27.674
 Finally,

26:27.674 --> 26:31.674
 High high high high high touch.

26:31.674 --> 26:36.320
 Bye bye.

26:37.320 --> 26:38.320
 How was it?

26:39.320 --> 26:40.320
 It was so fun.

26:41.320 --> 26:42.320
 It was fun.

26:43.320 --> 26:46.320
 I could relax and sing live.

26:47.320 --> 26:50.320
 I sang the old songs like Daijiman
Friends.

26:51.320 --> 26:55.320
 I sang the song of Oharu before Tokisen
was released.

26:56.320 --> 26:57.320
 I sang the original song.

26:57.320 --> 27:06.320
 I was surprised to see Oharu singing
the song in the lesson.

27:07.320 --> 27:08.320
 I couldn't remember it.

27:09.320 --> 27:10.320
 I couldn't remember it at all.

27:11.320 --> 27:18.320
 I remember the old songs and the
original songs.

27:19.320 --> 27:24.320
 It was a live performance that I could
look back on.

27:24.320 --> 27:28.320
 I felt like I was touching my old
heart.

27:29.320 --> 27:34.320
 I felt like I was closer to the
members.

27:35.320 --> 27:36.320
 I was in eye contact with them.

27:37.320 --> 27:38.320
 I was happy to see them.

27:39.320 --> 27:41.320
 I remember the second song of the song
called Jinsei Saikondo Melody.

27:42.320 --> 27:43.320
 I remember that.

27:44.320 --> 27:48.320
 I was the first to put my hand forward.

27:49.320 --> 27:50.320
 Hitoka was the same.

27:51.320 --> 27:52.320
 I was the first to put my hand forward.

27:52.320 --> 27:53.320
 I was in front of her.

27:54.320 --> 27:56.320
 I was in a perfect circle.

27:57.320 --> 27:58.320
 I was in a perfect circle.

27:59.320 --> 28:00.320
 I was in a perfect circle.

28:01.320 --> 28:03.320
 I thought it was good to have a live
performance like this.

28:04.320 --> 28:05.320
 I wanted to have a live performance
like this.

28:06.320 --> 28:10.320
 We performed the song called Touch.

28:11.320 --> 28:16.320
 I heard that the theme was to touch and
meet.

28:17.320 --> 28:19.320
 We were conscious of that.

28:19.320 --> 28:21.320
 We were conscious of that.

28:22.320 --> 28:27.320
 We were conscious of that.

28:28.320 --> 28:31.320
 We performed the song called Touch.

28:32.320 --> 28:39.320
 We were conscious of that.

28:40.320 --> 28:43.320
 We wanted to make the audience feel
this distance.

28:44.320 --> 28:45.320
 I thought so.

28:46.320 --> 28:47.320
 I thought so.

28:47.320 --> 28:48.320
 I thought so.

28:49.320 --> 28:51.320
 I enjoyed it.

28:52.320 --> 28:58.320
 I was glad that we could do a live
performance at home.

28:59.320 --> 29:04.320
 We don't usually jump at home.

29:05.320 --> 29:06.320
 We jumped at home.

29:07.320 --> 29:08.320
 I was surprised.

29:09.320 --> 29:13.320
 We jumped at home on New Year's Day.

29:14.320 --> 29:15.320
 That's good.

29:15.320 --> 29:19.320
 We could do a wave.

29:20.320 --> 29:26.320
 We could do it because of the camera
angle.

29:27.320 --> 29:32.320
 I think everyone jumped at the timing
they wanted.

29:33.320 --> 29:36.320
 I couldn't see it, but I could see it.

29:37.320 --> 29:38.320
 I know what you mean.

29:39.320 --> 29:42.320
 I could see that.

29:42.320 --> 29:45.320
 I like the lyrics of Beauty.

29:46.320 --> 29:47.320
 I like the lyrics.

29:48.320 --> 29:49.320
 I like the lyrics.

29:50.320 --> 29:53.320
 I like the lyrics.

29:54.320 --> 29:56.320
 I was about to say the same thing.

29:57.320 --> 29:59.320
 I like the lyrics of Rap.

30:00.320 --> 30:03.320
 I like the lyrics.

30:04.320 --> 30:06.320
 I think it's a good song.

30:06.320 --> 30:11.320
 I want to cherish this song.

30:12.320 --> 30:14.320
 It's an old song.

30:15.320 --> 30:19.320
 I want to make this song more popular.

30:20.320 --> 30:28.320
 I want to cherish the old songs and the
current songs.

30:28.320 --> 30:45.320
 Thank you for inviting us to your first
touch performance.

30:46.320 --> 30:47.320
 I'm glad.

30:48.320 --> 30:49.320
 I've never been to an event like this.

30:49.320 --> 30:58.320
 I'm glad to be invited to this event.

30:59.320 --> 31:06.320
 I think we've grown up since we were
young.

31:07.320 --> 31:14.320
 I want to use the word touch in the
future.

31:14.320 --> 31:18.320
 We want to meet a lot of people.

31:19.320 --> 31:21.320
 I think there will be a lot of live
performances this year.

31:22.320 --> 31:26.320
 I want to meet a lot of people in
various situations.

31:27.320 --> 31:28.320
 Thank you.

31:29.320 --> 31:30.320
 Touch.

31:30.320 --> 31:35.696
 See you again.

31:36.696 --> 31:40.696
 When you're lost, remember

31:40.696 --> 31:44.696
 So that you can laugh even when it
rains

31:44.696 --> 31:48.696
 Come on, let's go anywhere

31:48.696 --> 31:52.696
 Goodbye, goodbye, I'm the same as
yesterday

31:52.696 --> 31:56.696
 The city after the rain is sparkling

31:56.696 --> 31:58.696
 My heart is like a sunny pattern

31:58.696 --> 32:00.696
 I play the piano of the rainbow

32:00.696 --> 32:05.696
 And play the piano of the rainbow

32:05.696 --> 32:09.696
 Goodbye, goodbye, I'm the same as
yesterday

32:09.696 --> 32:13.696
 The city after the rain is sparkling

32:13.696 --> 32:15.696
 My heart is like a sunny pattern

32:15.696 --> 32:20.696
 I play the piano of the rainbow

32:36.666 --> 32:43.666
