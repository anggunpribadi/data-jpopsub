00:20.442 --> 00:24.062
 This area is considered to be the
safest area for children in Japan.

00:24.462 --> 00:27.682
 But frequent patronese or working class
flu cases are high.

00:28.042 --> 00:29.742

 No matter how many times I fall, I
won't give up.

01:04.762 --> 01:06.762
 More, more, more, more.

01:06.762 --> 01:09.762
 Aiming for the top, I'll be a good boy.

02:19.762 --> 02:21.762
 Please listen to it.

02:21.762 --> 02:25.360
 3000 Days.

02:26.360 --> 02:31.360
 Even after 3000 days,

02:31.360 --> 02:37.360
 this eyelid can only see your face.

02:37.360 --> 02:48.360
 You are the only one who can feel the
happiness.

02:48.360 --> 03:00.360
 You are the only one who can feel the
happiness.

03:07.098 --> 03:13.098
 I'm going to enjoy it so it's closed.
Are you all ready?

03:13.098 --> 03:14.098

03:14.098 --> 03:26.098
 Let's go! Wonderful Tohoku!

03:56.106 --> 03:59.606
 I don't have a heart, I don't have a
heart

03:59.606 --> 04:04.106
 I don't have a heart, I don't have a
heart

04:06.368 --> 04:12.378
 Translated by Releska

04:12.378 --> 04:16.378

 Don't get heatstroke!

04:43.992 --> 04:53.754
 Thank you!

04:53.754 --> 04:55.754
 I'm pregnant.

04:57.232 --> 04:59.232
 It's good.

05:01.232 --> 05:03.232
 I like the taste of strawberry.

05:03.232 --> 05:05.232
 It's the wind of winter.

05:09.232 --> 05:14.232
 I'll sing tomorrow and come back to the
concert hall.

05:14.232 --> 05:16.232
 Thank you.

05:16.232 --> 05:18.232

05:39.128 --> 05:41.128
 I'm being photographed.

05:41.128 --> 05:43.128
 Stop it.

05:43.128 --> 05:45.128
 Take a picture of me.

05:45.128 --> 05:47.128
 Please stop it.

05:47.128 --> 05:49.128

 I think it's a great opportunity to see
the fireworks with the people of
Mononofu.

06:27.562 --> 06:31.562
 I hope we can all share this happy time
together.

06:31.562 --> 06:36.794
 Let's enjoy it together!

06:36.794 --> 06:46.794
 I was watching the fireworks and I felt
proud of myself as a member of the same
club.

06:46.794 --> 06:50.794
 I thought that such a wonderful
fireworks would be held.

06:50.794 --> 06:56.794
 I was really happy to see it with such
wonderful people.

06:56.794 --> 07:09.794
 The stage of Haruichi Okoro seems to be
crying before the performance.

07:09.794 --> 07:16.794
 I was looking forward to the day.

07:16.794 --> 07:26.794

 That's good!

09:51.082 --> 09:53.082
 Let's practice.

09:53.082 --> 09:54.082

10:00.082 --> 10:03.082
 I want to go to Stapler.

10:03.082 --> 10:07.834
 Isn't it difficult?

10:07.834 --> 10:12.594
 She is asking us where to eat highway-
style spreads

10:12.594 --> 10:14.594
 The contrast is amazing.

10:15.680 --> 10:17.680
 Go!

10:17.680 --> 10:19.680
 See you!

10:19.680 --> 10:21.680

 I'm going to buy a manager.

10:39.680 --> 10:41.680
 I bought a bad guy.

10:41.680 --> 10:43.680
 I'm a bad guy.

10:43.680 --> 10:45.680
 It was fun to distribute the villa.

10:45.680 --> 10:47.680
 It was fun.

10:47.680 --> 10:49.680
 It's been a while since I've done it.

10:49.680 --> 10:51.680
 Yesterday, I was like,

10:51.680 --> 10:53.680
 Who is this?

10:53.680 --> 10:55.680
 Day 2,

10:55.680 --> 10:57.680

 Everyone follows me when I jump in.

10:59.680 --> 11:01.680
 I wonder if you're watching.

11:01.680 --> 11:03.680

11:07.680 --> 11:09.680
 I can't see the number of people.

11:09.680 --> 11:13.680
 How was it yesterday and today?

11:13.680 --> 11:15.680
 There were more people today.

11:15.680 --> 11:17.680
 Yesterday,

11:17.680 --> 11:19.680
 I stopped for a while.

11:19.680 --> 11:21.680
 There were a lot of people going
somewhere.

11:21.680 --> 11:23.680
 This time, there were a lot of people
from the beginning.

11:23.680 --> 11:25.680
 You've been watching.

11:25.680 --> 11:27.680
 You've been watching me.

11:27.680 --> 11:29.680
 The first song is Sakura Promise.

11:29.680 --> 11:31.680
 Everyone's dancing.

11:31.680 --> 11:33.680
 I thought it was warm.
