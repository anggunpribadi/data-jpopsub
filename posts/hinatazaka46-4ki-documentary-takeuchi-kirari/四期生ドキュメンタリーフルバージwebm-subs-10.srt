00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:12,000
Thank you for watching!

2
00:00:12,026 --> 00:00:18,726
Excuse me.

3
00:00:33,826 --> 00:00:36,794
Believe or not...

4
00:00:49,082 --> 00:00:56,082
So I hope to try to make Pokemon's
zipper look pretty.

5
00:00:58,082 --> 00:01:01,082
There may be some parts that look funny
for the kids,

6
00:01:01,082 --> 00:01:05,082
and others won't look well.

7
00:01:05,082 --> 00:01:09,862
I study the handsome points of the
characters.

8
00:01:10,122 --> 00:01:12,402
I always have a special ap Winter.

9
00:01:12,402 --> 00:01:18,562
Don't be shocked, My

11
00:01:29,018 --> 00:01:35,018
Hello, I'm 16-year-old TAKEUCHI KIRARI
from Hiroshima.

12
00:01:37,018 --> 00:01:48,018
I want to feel more of Tokyo when I live
in Tokyo.

13
00:01:48,018 --> 00:01:59,018
I'm ready to climb the Tokyo Tower.

14
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:02,080
It's huge. I'm surprised.

15
00:02:02,080 --> 00:02:09,080
I'm a little worried about climbing
that.

16
00:02:09,080 --> 00:02:13,380
But it's great to feel Tokyo.

17
00:02:13,380 --> 00:02:15,180
I'm looking forward to it.

18
00:02:15,180 --> 00:02:19,180
I'm looking forward to the beautiful
office building.

19
00:02:19,180 --> 00:02:23,180
I'm looking forward to the beautiful
office building.

20
00:02:23,180 --> 00:02:28,680
I'm looking forward to the beautiful
office building.

21
00:02:28,680 --> 00:02:28,704
I'm looking forward to the beautiful
office building.

22
00:02:28,704 --> 00:02:33,704
High school students these days are very
shiny.

23
00:02:33,704 --> 00:02:46,586
I've never received a shiny JK before,
so I'm looking forward to it.

24
00:02:46,586 --> 00:02:52,586
I can't believe I'm going to climb this.

25
00:02:52,586 --> 00:03:00,586
I'm going to live in Tokyo from now on.

26
00:03:00,586 --> 00:03:12,314
I'll do my best.

27
00:03:12,314 --> 00:03:15,314
I'm a bit open-minded.

28
00:03:15,314 --> 00:03:18,314
I feel like I'm outside.

29
00:03:18,314 --> 00:03:20,314
My favorite four-letter idiom is

30
00:03:20,314 --> 00:03:22,314
絶対絶命.

31
00:03:25,314 --> 00:03:27,314
My mom says,

32
00:03:27,314 --> 00:03:30,314
I want to be popular,

33
00:03:30,314 --> 00:03:33,314
and I want to be in Tokyo.

34
00:03:33,314 --> 00:03:35,314
My favorite phone is

35
00:03:35,314 --> 00:03:37,314
餅巾着.

36
00:03:37,314 --> 00:03:39,314
Rainbow bridge.

37
00:03:39,314 --> 00:03:41,088
I feel like...

38
00:03:41,088 --> 00:03:50,088
In my hometown, there is a very
beautiful bridge called Setohashi.

39
00:03:50,088 --> 00:04:00,506
It's similar to that bridge, and it
feels like I'm close to it.

40
00:04:00,506 --> 00:04:02,506
Wow!

41
00:04:02,506 --> 00:04:06,506
We just arrived, so we don't know what's
going on.

42
00:04:06,506 --> 00:04:08,506
Wow, we just arrived!

43
00:04:10,506 --> 00:04:12,506
Wow, it's so beautiful!

44
00:04:12,506 --> 00:04:14,506
Wow, it's so big!

45
00:04:14,506 --> 00:04:18,506
It's different from Hiroshima.

46
00:04:18,506 --> 00:04:20,506
Wow, it's so beautiful!

47
00:04:20,506 --> 00:04:24,506
Is that a Budokan?

48
00:04:24,506 --> 00:04:30,506
It's a Budokan.

49
00:04:31,418 --> 00:04:34,418
I saw the sky tree.

50
00:04:35,418 --> 00:04:37,418
There it is.

51
00:04:37,418 --> 00:04:39,418
It's quite far.

52
00:04:40,418 --> 00:04:42,418
What is Hiroshima like?

53
00:04:43,418 --> 00:04:46,418
It's a city that values peace.

54
00:04:46,418 --> 00:04:49,418
While maintaining peace,

55
00:04:49,418 --> 00:04:52,418
nature is also important.

56
00:04:52,418 --> 00:04:54,418
But to make it more developed,

57
00:04:54,418 --> 00:04:57,418
to make it popular among young people,

58
00:04:57,418 --> 00:04:59,418
the city is also beautiful.

59
00:04:59,418 --> 00:05:01,418
It's big.

60
00:05:01,536 --> 00:05:05,536
There is a shopping mall.

61
00:05:18,362 --> 00:05:26,362
I didn't have a bright life in school
life.

62
00:05:26,362 --> 00:05:29,362
I was in a student council.

63
00:05:29,362 --> 00:05:34,362
I don't hate to be in public.

64
00:05:34,362 --> 00:05:39,362
I thought I had a chance.

65
00:05:39,362 --> 00:05:44,362
If I had a chance, I would like to be in
the student council.

66
00:05:44,362 --> 00:05:48,288
If I pass the exam, I will be in the
student council.

67
00:05:48,288 --> 00:05:52,288
I was so happy.

68
00:05:55,288 --> 00:05:57,288
I'm here.

69
00:05:57,288 --> 00:06:01,288
This is my first time to climb the Tokyo
Tower.

70
00:06:01,288 --> 00:06:07,288
I'm ready to be a 4th grader.

71
00:06:07,288 --> 00:06:10,288
I have a big goal.

72
00:06:10,288 --> 00:06:15,288
I will challenge myself to reach it.

73
00:06:15,288 --> 00:06:18,288
I will eat Monjayaki next.

74
00:06:18,528 --> 00:06:20,528
Let's go!

75
00:06:23,528 --> 00:06:26,528
I'm at Tsukishima Monjayaki Shopping
Street.

76
00:06:27,528 --> 00:06:31,528
There are no Monjayaki shops in
Hiroshima.

77
00:06:31,528 --> 00:06:34,528
There is no opportunity to eat.

78
00:06:34,528 --> 00:06:37,528
Even if you make it at home,

79
00:06:37,528 --> 00:06:39,528
you can't make it.

80
00:06:39,528 --> 00:06:43,528
You have to do it on the iron plate.

81
00:06:43,528 --> 00:06:45,744
So...

82
00:06:45,744 --> 00:06:48,044
I thought it was a chance.

83
00:06:48,864 --> 00:06:53,544
I was saying グー in the car.

84
00:06:54,124 --> 00:06:56,004
Tsukishima Monja.

85
00:06:56,004 --> 00:06:58,004
Do you write Tsukishima like this?

86
00:06:58,684 --> 00:07:00,844
No, you write Komachi.

87
00:07:01,324 --> 00:07:02,884
Oh, Komachi.

88
00:07:03,144 --> 00:07:06,084
Tsukishima Komachi Monja.

89
00:07:06,084 --> 00:07:07,084
You're wrong.

90
00:07:07,084 --> 00:07:09,084
Sorry.

91
00:07:10,084 --> 00:07:12,084
Excuse me.

92
00:07:12,084 --> 00:07:15,024
Oh, it's so annoying.

93
00:07:15,024 --> 00:07:18,024
I eat delicious food all the time.

94
00:07:18,024 --> 00:07:21,024
I'm sorry.

95
00:07:21,024 --> 00:07:23,024
Excuse me.

96
00:07:23,024 --> 00:07:25,024
I'd like to have the most popular one.

97
00:07:25,024 --> 00:07:27,024
Mochi-mete cheese-mon-chee?

98
00:07:27,024 --> 00:07:28,024
Yes.

99
00:07:28,024 --> 00:07:30,024
And I'd like some oyster butter.

100
00:07:30,024 --> 00:07:31,024
Oyster butter?

101
00:07:31,024 --> 00:07:32,024
Yes.

102
00:07:36,024 --> 00:07:38,024
Can I mix the cod and cheese?

103
00:07:38,024 --> 00:07:39,024
Yes.

104
00:07:39,024 --> 00:07:45,024
Take the soup stock out of the bowl.

105
00:07:45,072 --> 00:07:47,072
Add the cheese.

106
00:07:47,072 --> 00:07:48,072
Yes.

107
00:07:48,072 --> 00:07:51,072
It will be a soft and fluffy rice ball.

108
00:07:53,072 --> 00:07:54,072
It looks delicious.

109
00:07:55,072 --> 00:07:56,072
Let's eat.

110
00:08:04,072 --> 00:08:06,072
This is seafood.

111
00:08:06,072 --> 00:08:08,072
Is it okay to grill it like this?

112
00:08:08,072 --> 00:08:09,072
It's difficult.

113
00:08:09,072 --> 00:08:14,448
It's delicious.

114
00:08:14,448 --> 00:08:16,448
It's difficult.

115
00:08:20,448 --> 00:08:22,448
It's difficult.

116
00:08:24,448 --> 00:08:26,448
Let's eat.

117
00:08:36,448 --> 00:08:40,448
The cheese and cod roe are rich and
mixed well.

118
00:08:40,448 --> 00:08:44,448
It's very delicious.

119
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:46,880
It's very hot.

120
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:48,880
It's very different from Okonomiyaki.

121
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:50,880
This is Monja.

122
00:08:50,880 --> 00:09:00,336
It's very different from Okonomiyaki.

123
00:09:00,336 --> 00:09:02,336
Cheers!

124
00:09:02,336 --> 00:09:04,336
I'm going to eat Okonomiyaki.

125
00:09:04,336 --> 00:09:19,610
Itadakimasu.

126
00:09:19,610 --> 00:09:36,790
I am a soft girl and I am Big
development.

127
00:09:36,912 --> 00:09:42,912
I want to be a girl who is loved by
everyone.

128
00:09:42,912 --> 00:09:58,416
If I have any problems, I want to be an
idol who can cheer me up.

129
00:09:58,416 --> 00:10:00,416
I made it.

130
00:10:00,416 --> 00:10:02,416
I made it for the first time.

131
00:10:06,416 --> 00:10:08,416
Let's eat.

132
00:10:08,416 --> 00:10:22,416
It's different from the mentaiko mochi.

133
00:10:23,520 --> 00:10:29,520
I can feel the thickness of the mochi.

134
00:10:30,520 --> 00:10:37,520
I can feel the deliciousness of the
vegetables.

135
00:10:38,520 --> 00:10:41,520
I ate a lot and I'm full.

136
00:10:41,520 --> 00:10:43,520
Thank you for the meal.

137
00:10:43,520 --> 00:10:45,520
I'm full.

138
00:10:45,520 --> 00:10:53,472
large meat

139
00:10:53,472 --> 00:11:00,472
I came here with my mother for the 4th
and final exam

140
00:11:00,472 --> 00:11:03,472
I was able to pass the exam safely

141
00:11:03,472 --> 00:11:09,472
I chose this place to convey my
gratitude

142
00:11:09,472 --> 00:11:21,914
It's a good spot

It's a big one!

149
00:12:13,546 --> 00:12:15,546
It's a big one!
