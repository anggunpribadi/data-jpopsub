Hello, I'm Izuki Nakashima.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:12,058
Today, I'm going to introduce my
favorite things.

3
00:00:12,058 --> 00:00:17,058
I'm in the mountains of Tenpai Mountain
in Fukuoka.

4
00:00:17,058 --> 00:00:21,058
I'm from Fukuoka Prefecture.

5
00:00:21,058 --> 00:00:31,058
When I was in elementary school, I lived
in a town called Saiki City in Oita
Prefecture.

6
00:00:31,058 --> 00:00:37,680
I like nature because there was only
nature.

7
00:00:38,680 --> 00:00:41,680
I'm good at fine work.

8
00:00:42,680 --> 00:00:46,680
I'm good at hair arrangement and nail.

9
00:00:46,680 --> 00:00:52,680
I'm not good at sports.

10
00:00:54,424 --> 00:00:59,424
I'm not good at sports, but I'm not good
at sports.

11
00:01:00,424 --> 00:01:02,424
I can't swim.

12
00:01:03,424 --> 00:01:07,424
I'm going to eat now.

13
00:01:08,424 --> 00:01:10,424
It smells good.

14
00:01:11,424 --> 00:01:17,424
There are shops selling mentaiko and
green tea.

15
00:01:17,424 --> 00:01:23,424
I chose a flavor called Monaka.

16
00:01:27,400 --> 00:01:31,400
It's packed with red bean paste and the
inside is crispy.

17
00:01:31,400 --> 00:01:33,400
It's delicious.

18
00:01:33,400 --> 00:01:44,282
I'm going to have a mentai-chazuke.

19
00:01:44,282 --> 00:01:46,282
I'm happy.

20
00:01:47,282 --> 00:01:51,282
I'm happiest when I eat delicious food.

21
00:01:53,282 --> 00:01:54,282
I finished eating.

22
00:01:55,282 --> 00:01:56,282
Thank you for the meal.

23
00:01:57,282 --> 00:02:03,282
I just noticed, but I might have eaten
too much.

24
00:02:04,282 --> 00:02:05,282
It was all delicious.

25
00:02:05,282 --> 00:02:11,920
What kind of idol do you want to be?

26
00:02:12,920 --> 00:02:24,920
I can't see myself in the future yet,
but I'm trying hard to be in front of
me.

27
00:02:24,920 --> 00:02:29,920
I want to be like that in the future.

28
00:02:30,920 --> 00:02:34,920
I'm pretty serious.

29
00:02:34,920 --> 00:02:39,744
I don't know.

30
00:02:39,744 --> 00:02:47,744
I don't think I need to change my
serious side.

31
00:02:47,744 --> 00:02:56,560
I want to be an idol that people will be
glad to see me perform.

32
00:02:57,560 --> 00:03:08,560
I don't think that the BUDDIES will
welcome me from the beginning because
I'm a senior fan.

33
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:26,560
But I want to do my best so that someday
the third generation will be glad to see
me perform.
