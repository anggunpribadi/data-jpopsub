1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
1st place

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,000
The remaining is

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Yes, 1st place

4
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,000
1st place

5
00:00:08,048 --> 00:00:10,048
And Hina-chan

6
00:00:10,048 --> 00:00:12,048
And I'm Ai Kawayakata

7
00:00:12,048 --> 00:00:14,048
You have a daughter, right?

8
00:00:14,048 --> 00:00:15,048
I don't want to

9
00:00:15,048 --> 00:00:18,048
I think it's fine to have her as a
regular member of the group

10
00:00:18,048 --> 00:00:20,048
No, no, no

11
00:00:20,048 --> 00:00:21,048
You can do it

12
00:00:21,048 --> 00:00:24,048
The third place is this

13
00:00:24,048 --> 00:00:26,048
Come on, come on, come on

14
00:00:29,048 --> 00:00:31,048
I got it, this is just right

15
00:00:31,048 --> 00:00:34,048
The gap between the left eye and the
right eye is a bit narrow,

16
00:00:34,048 --> 00:00:38,048
but you can show a very high level of
concentration

17
00:00:38,048 --> 00:00:40,048
And when you set a goal,

18
00:00:40,048 --> 00:00:44,048
you try to achieve it without shaking
your left eye

19
00:00:44,048 --> 00:00:46,048
But it's a straight line

20
00:00:46,048 --> 00:00:48,048
I like to concentrate

21
00:00:48,048 --> 00:00:54,048
I like to make something in a quiet
place

22
00:00:54,048 --> 00:00:56,048
I like to relax

23
00:00:56,048 --> 00:00:57,048
Great

24
00:00:57,048 --> 00:01:01,048
Here is Hirota's 2016 detailed fortune

25
00:01:01,048 --> 00:01:03,048
Say something good, Ikebukuro

26
00:01:03,048 --> 00:01:05,048
Great, great

27
00:01:05,048 --> 00:01:08,048
I'm the one who wants it the most

28
00:01:09,520 --> 00:01:11,520
I think I can bring it to you with my
luck

29
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:12,520
That's true

30
00:01:12,520 --> 00:01:13,520
It's important

31
00:01:13,520 --> 00:01:14,520
Amazing

32
00:01:14,520 --> 00:01:17,520
If you have a goal, you will act to
achieve it

33
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:19,520
But it's hard to see around you

34
00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:21,520
And you tend to be around yourself

35
00:01:21,520 --> 00:01:24,520
So if you listen to people's opinions,
you'll be lucky

36
00:01:26,520 --> 00:01:31,520
It's also a year of growing up by
meeting a lot of people and seeking new
encounters

37
00:01:32,520 --> 00:01:35,520
It's important to listen to people's
opinions

38
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:44,520
I think it's meaningless if you don't
enjoy the time when you're 17 years old

39
00:01:44,520 --> 00:01:48,520
So I think you should think more

40
00:01:48,520 --> 00:01:49,520
I'm curious

41
00:01:50,520 --> 00:01:52,520
I want to be 17 soon

42
00:01:52,520 --> 00:01:56,520
I want to polish myself like I'm really
old

43
00:01:56,520 --> 00:01:58,520
Like a flower?

44
00:02:01,496 --> 00:02:02,496
We're done!

45
00:02:03,496 --> 00:02:07,496
The remaining members are Ayaka, Hinata
and me.

46
00:02:08,496 --> 00:02:10,496
I'm nervous! I'm so nervous!

47
00:02:11,496 --> 00:02:12,496
I'm confident!

48
00:02:12,496 --> 00:02:14,800
To be continued!

49
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:16,800
The winner is...

50
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:18,800
Come on, come on, come on...

51
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:20,800
Oh!

52
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:22,800
I won!

53
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:24,800
I'm so happy!

54
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:26,800
The second place goes to Hinata.

55
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:30,800
She is curious, imaginative, and has a
good sense of judgment.

56
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:33,800
She is easy-going, but she is weak in
flattery.

57
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:35,800
That's it!

58
00:02:35,800 --> 00:02:39,800
If I get a little shy, I can easily get
flattered.

59
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:42,800
Wow!

60
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:44,800
She is good on average.

61
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:46,800
She is very good at girls.

62
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:48,800
39 points.

63
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:50,800
I feel lucky.

64
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:52,800
I'll report this.

65
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:54,800
She is good at girls.

66
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:56,800
Really?

67
00:02:56,800 --> 00:03:01,800
She is lucky in general, so if she takes
care of her intuition, she will have the
best year.

68
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:04,800
And she has a very good skin color.

69
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:06,800
She is very lucky, but...

70
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:11,800
Her compliment is 80% right.

71
00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:13,800
Her skin is very shiny.

72
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:15,800
I can see her skin's color.

73
00:03:15,800 --> 00:03:17,872
Thank you for watching!

74
00:03:18,872 --> 00:03:21,872
Before we announce the winner, we have a
bonus announcement.

75
00:03:21,872 --> 00:03:22,872
What is the bonus?

76
00:03:22,872 --> 00:03:24,872
You can drink this.

77
00:03:30,872 --> 00:03:33,872
I don't care about your fortune.

78
00:03:33,872 --> 00:03:40,872
I will announce the personality of the
manager, Kofujii.

79
00:03:40,872 --> 00:03:47,872
She has narrow eyes and narrow left and
right senses. She is a nervous person
and is very serious.

80
00:03:51,528 --> 00:03:54,528
Is she busy with work and lack of sleep?
Or does she have no sense of justice?

81
00:03:54,528 --> 00:03:56,528
A big negative factor.

82
00:03:56,528 --> 00:03:58,528
I'll put a pillow on her.

83
00:03:58,528 --> 00:04:00,528
Let her sleep.

84
00:04:00,528 --> 00:04:02,528
Kizuna AI

85
00:04:02,528 --> 00:04:04,528
Finally.

86
00:04:04,528 --> 00:04:07,528
We are the two who are going to sleep.

87
00:04:07,528 --> 00:04:09,528
Really.

88
00:04:09,528 --> 00:04:10,528
This is hard.

89
00:04:10,528 --> 00:04:12,528
That's why I'm the first.

90
00:04:12,528 --> 00:04:15,528
I'm happy when I think I'm the last and
I'm the first.

91
00:04:15,528 --> 00:04:16,528
I'm the last.

92
00:04:16,528 --> 00:04:17,528
I'm the last.

93
00:04:17,528 --> 00:04:18,528
I'll go.

94
00:04:18,528 --> 00:04:19,528
Please.

95
00:04:19,528 --> 00:04:22,528
This is the result of 2016.

96
00:04:22,528 --> 00:04:25,528
The result is...

97
00:04:25,528 --> 00:04:27,528
The third time.

98
00:04:27,528 --> 00:04:29,528
The third time.

99
00:04:29,528 --> 00:04:31,528
The third time.

100
00:04:31,528 --> 00:04:32,528
Congratulations.

101
00:04:32,528 --> 00:04:34,528
The third time.

102
00:04:34,528 --> 00:04:35,528
It's hard.

103
00:04:35,528 --> 00:04:36,528
It's hard.

104
00:04:36,528 --> 00:04:37,528
I don't want to do it.

105
00:04:37,528 --> 00:04:41,528
I'll announce the personality of Ayaka.

106
00:04:41,528 --> 00:04:43,528
Cheer up.

107
00:04:43,528 --> 00:04:44,528
I'll read it.

108
00:04:44,528 --> 00:04:50,528
She has a delicate heart and a sensual
personality.

109
00:04:50,528 --> 00:04:53,528
She has a high sense of smell and a
tight mouth.

110
00:04:53,528 --> 00:04:55,528
She is a lucky face.

111
00:04:55,528 --> 00:04:58,528
Her contrast between black and white
eyes is clear.

112
00:04:58,528 --> 00:05:00,528
She has a bright eye.

113
00:05:00,528 --> 00:05:03,528
She is full of energy.

114
00:05:03,528 --> 00:05:05,528
Her skin is beautiful.

115
00:05:05,528 --> 00:05:07,528
She is healthy.

116
00:05:07,528 --> 00:05:09,528
She is very energetic.

117
00:05:09,528 --> 00:05:13,528
She is like a person who takes a bath.

118
00:05:13,528 --> 00:05:15,528
She is like a person who takes a bath.

119
00:05:15,528 --> 00:05:18,528
I'll wear the costume of the next new
song.

120
00:05:18,528 --> 00:05:20,304
Please look forward to the next.

121
00:05:22,312 --> 00:05:23,312
I did it!

122
00:05:24,312 --> 00:05:25,312
Wow!

123
00:05:25,312 --> 00:05:26,312
What is this?

124
00:05:27,312 --> 00:05:28,312
Touch!

125
00:05:29,312 --> 00:05:32,312
You can see your luck by the color of
your skin and the shine of your eyes.

126
00:05:33,312 --> 00:05:36,312
People come to the shining things, so
good luck will gather.

127
00:05:36,312 --> 00:05:41,312
This year, you are in good luck, so if
you go forward with confidence, the
result will follow.

128
00:05:41,312 --> 00:05:44,312
I'm not happy to be shining.

129
00:05:44,312 --> 00:05:50,312
I used to like the eyes of Mayuma-chan's
dead fish.

130
00:05:51,312 --> 00:05:52,312
Are you comparing?

131
00:05:52,312 --> 00:05:54,312
Are you comparing?

132
00:05:54,312 --> 00:05:55,312
Really?

133
00:05:55,312 --> 00:05:56,312
Yes.

134
00:05:56,312 --> 00:05:57,312
Are you comparing?

135
00:05:57,312 --> 00:06:00,096
I'm not happy to be shining.

136
00:06:01,096 --> 00:06:04,096
The winner is...

137
00:06:04,096 --> 00:06:06,096
This one.

138
00:06:06,096 --> 00:06:07,096
Who is it?

139
00:06:09,096 --> 00:06:10,096
I'm sorry.

140
00:06:10,096 --> 00:06:12,096
I read it worse than that.

141
00:06:12,096 --> 00:06:13,096
It's okay.

142
00:06:13,096 --> 00:06:15,096
With a sharp mouth,

143
00:06:15,096 --> 00:06:17,096
Even with a closed mouth,

144
00:06:17,096 --> 00:06:19,096
Between the upper and lower lips,

145
00:06:19,096 --> 00:06:22,096
Draw a curved line like a wave.

146
00:06:22,096 --> 00:06:24,096
I have a loved lip.

147
00:06:24,096 --> 00:06:27,096
This is THE IDOL GROUP.

148
00:06:27,096 --> 00:06:28,096
That's great.

149
00:06:28,096 --> 00:06:31,096
If you live a proper life and take care
of your health,

150
00:06:31,096 --> 00:06:33,096
You'll have a big break in popularity.

151
00:06:33,096 --> 00:06:35,096
You eat with a big bite.

152
00:06:35,096 --> 00:06:36,096
That's it.

153
00:06:36,096 --> 00:06:40,096
You are a cute and loved type.

154
00:06:40,096 --> 00:06:42,096
You can be forgiven for doing anything.

155
00:06:42,096 --> 00:06:45,096
You should be careful.

156
00:06:46,096 --> 00:06:47,096
This is you.

157
00:06:47,096 --> 00:06:51,096
I've been thinking a lot about eating
with a big bite.

158
00:06:51,096 --> 00:06:52,096
You?

159
00:06:52,096 --> 00:06:53,096
No.

160
00:06:53,096 --> 00:06:54,096
I'm not.

161
00:06:54,096 --> 00:06:55,096
I'll forgive you.

162
00:06:55,096 --> 00:06:56,096
Really?

163
00:06:56,096 --> 00:06:58,096
I'll forgive you.

164
00:06:58,096 --> 00:07:01,096
I'll forgive you.

165
00:07:01,096 --> 00:07:02,096
The winner is...

166
00:07:02,096 --> 00:07:04,096
I'm so good at drawing.

167
00:07:04,096 --> 00:07:06,096
It's only one point different from me.

168
00:07:06,096 --> 00:07:08,096
You're a girl of 10 years old.

169
00:07:08,096 --> 00:07:10,096
That's great.

170
00:07:10,096 --> 00:07:12,096
It's hard to react because I saw the
picture.

171
00:07:12,096 --> 00:07:13,096
That's right.

172
00:07:13,096 --> 00:07:14,096
It's good.

173
00:07:14,096 --> 00:07:17,096
But, you're the tallest.

174
00:07:17,096 --> 00:07:18,096
That's right.

175
00:07:18,096 --> 00:07:19,096
That's right.

176
00:07:19,096 --> 00:07:20,096
That's right.

177
00:07:20,096 --> 00:07:23,096
But, you're back to reality.

178
00:07:23,096 --> 00:07:28,096
Finally, I'll give you a lucky draw for
2016.

179
00:07:28,096 --> 00:07:31,096
You have a good face color.

180
00:07:31,096 --> 00:07:33,096
So, your luck is going up.

181
00:07:33,096 --> 00:07:40,096
In addition, I want another person with
a good-looking hair style.

182
00:07:40,096 --> 00:07:46,096
I want you to have a good-looking hair
style.

183
00:07:47,096 --> 00:07:49,096
I'm going to do it.

184
00:07:49,096 --> 00:07:50,096
Don't worry.

185
00:07:50,096 --> 00:07:50,128
