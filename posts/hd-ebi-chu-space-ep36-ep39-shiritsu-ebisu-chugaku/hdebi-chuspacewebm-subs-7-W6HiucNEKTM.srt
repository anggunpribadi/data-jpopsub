1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,832
Emi-cha!

2
00:00:02,832 --> 00:00:06,312
You don't know the feeling of the season
when you are here

3
00:00:06,312 --> 00:00:08,752
Yes, but it's spring

4
00:00:08,752 --> 00:00:10,512
You are a junior high school student,
right?

5
00:00:10,512 --> 00:00:11,312
Yes, I am

6
00:00:11,312 --> 00:00:13,152
I want to eat crepes

7
00:00:13,152 --> 00:00:14,592
In Jukuhara?

8
00:00:14,592 --> 00:00:16,512
Yes, I want to go to Jukuhara

9
00:00:16,512 --> 00:00:17,832
I want to go

10
00:00:17,832 --> 00:00:18,912
But it's fine, right?

11
00:00:18,912 --> 00:00:21,152
Professional junior high school students
are free

12
00:00:21,152 --> 00:00:22,512
Really?

13
00:00:22,512 --> 00:00:25,792
What are you doing?

14
00:00:25,792 --> 00:00:26,992
I woke up at 10 o'clock

15
00:00:26,992 --> 00:00:29,592
That's unfair

16
00:00:29,592 --> 00:00:30,672
It's 10 o'clock

17
00:00:30,672 --> 00:00:34,232
Just called DD, Aqua Park

18
00:00:34,232 --> 00:00:35,832
I will be waiting for your job

19
00:00:35,832 --> 00:00:37,472
Good

20
00:00:37,472 --> 00:00:40,512
Staff came

21
00:00:40,512 --> 00:00:43,632
Help

22
00:00:43,632 --> 00:00:52,392
Choose the exclamation system that is
part of the lie that SOLAR created

23
00:00:52,392 --> 00:00:55,032
Please leave a lie

24
00:00:55,032 --> 00:00:59,032
We will cooperate and do our best.

25
00:00:59,032 --> 00:01:01,032
We will leave two.

26
00:01:01,032 --> 00:01:03,032
Cooperative.

27
00:01:03,032 --> 00:01:05,032
Team play.

28
00:01:05,032 --> 00:01:07,032
Team play.

29
00:01:07,032 --> 00:01:09,032
Ready, go.

30
00:01:14,032 --> 00:01:16,032
It's impossible.

31
00:01:16,032 --> 00:01:18,032
How was it?

32
00:01:18,032 --> 00:01:20,032
Can you tell?

33
00:01:20,032 --> 00:01:22,032
I don't know.

34
00:01:22,032 --> 00:01:24,032
It's a group play.

35
00:01:24,032 --> 00:01:26,032
It's not a group play.

36
00:01:26,032 --> 00:01:27,032
I like this.

37
00:01:27,032 --> 00:01:30,032
No one can do push-ups for you.

38
00:01:30,032 --> 00:01:31,032
What does it mean?

39
00:01:31,032 --> 00:01:32,032
I don't know.

40
00:01:32,032 --> 00:01:35,032
My goal this year is inner muscle.

41
00:01:35,032 --> 00:01:36,032
I feel my destiny.

42
00:01:36,032 --> 00:01:41,032
I chose the real word.

43
00:01:41,978 --> 00:01:43,978
Wow!

44
00:01:43,978 --> 00:01:45,978
Amazing!

45
00:01:45,978 --> 00:01:47,978
Amazing!

46
00:01:47,978 --> 00:01:49,978
Amazing!

47
00:01:50,202 --> 00:01:54,642
The next one is Jim Rohn, a successful
philosopher

48
00:01:54,642 --> 00:01:56,642
Muscles are not a lie

49
00:01:56,642 --> 00:01:57,642
I see

50
00:01:57,642 --> 00:01:59,642
I was a genius

51
00:02:00,642 --> 00:02:02,642
Emi-chan

52
00:02:02,642 --> 00:02:03,642
Aya-chan

53
00:02:03,642 --> 00:02:04,642
Yes

54
00:02:04,642 --> 00:02:06,642
It's difficult

55
00:02:06,642 --> 00:02:08,642
You don't use the word genius

56
00:02:08,642 --> 00:02:12,642
So I can only write to someone who has
the power

57
00:02:12,642 --> 00:02:13,642
That's right

58
00:02:13,642 --> 00:02:17,642
The quote I chose is the real quote

59
00:02:17,642 --> 00:02:19,642
Correct

60
00:02:21,048 --> 00:02:23,048
Geete is the poet

61
00:02:23,048 --> 00:02:26,048
There is no priority among shrimp,
right?

62
00:02:26,048 --> 00:02:28,048
Is it about food?

63
00:02:28,048 --> 00:02:31,048
I chose the head of the fish

64
00:02:31,048 --> 00:02:34,048
The head of the fish

65
00:02:34,048 --> 00:02:36,048
I'm stupid

66
00:02:36,048 --> 00:02:39,048
I don't think it will change if I say it

67
00:02:39,048 --> 00:02:42,048
I think this is possible

68
00:02:42,048 --> 00:02:44,048
Horse?

69
00:02:44,048 --> 00:02:47,048
The idea is amazing

70
00:02:47,048 --> 00:02:49,048
I'm curious about this too

71
00:02:49,048 --> 00:02:52,048
This is the most difficult

72
00:02:52,048 --> 00:02:54,048
But it seems possible

73
00:02:54,048 --> 00:02:56,048
Really?

74
00:02:56,048 --> 00:03:00,048
People learn best by teaching

75
00:03:00,048 --> 00:03:05,048
The quote I chose is the real quote

76
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:07,900
Nice

77
00:03:08,816 --> 00:03:09,816
Ms. Seneka?

78
00:03:09,816 --> 00:03:10,816
Seneka-san?

79
00:03:10,816 --> 00:03:11,816
Seneka-san

80
00:03:11,816 --> 00:03:13,816
What do you teach in Ebichu?

81
00:03:13,816 --> 00:03:16,816
She teaches me a lot about Seto Ryo

82
00:03:16,816 --> 00:03:19,816
During the live, she teaches me a lot
about Seto Ryo

83
00:03:19,816 --> 00:03:22,816
She teaches me a lot about Shunji

84
00:03:22,816 --> 00:03:23,816
She has a good initiative

85
00:03:23,816 --> 00:03:24,816
Initiative?

86
00:03:24,816 --> 00:03:25,816
Yes, initiative

87
00:03:25,816 --> 00:03:26,816
I'm curious

88
00:03:26,816 --> 00:03:30,816
Before I go to bed, I'm like, wow

89
00:03:30,816 --> 00:03:34,816
But I don't have to think about it

90
00:03:34,816 --> 00:03:38,816
The quote I chose is the truth

91
00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:42,714
The truth!

92
00:03:42,714 --> 00:03:45,514
Is Colin Powell a politician?

93
00:03:45,514 --> 00:03:47,514
You know this right?

94
00:03:47,514 --> 00:03:48,754
I know it very well

95
00:03:48,754 --> 00:03:50,754
I'm often told I'm a political figure

96
00:03:50,754 --> 00:03:52,754
You don't have to worry so much

97
00:03:52,754 --> 00:03:54,754
You don't have to worry so much

98
00:03:54,754 --> 00:03:56,754
It's true when you go to the hospital

99
00:03:56,754 --> 00:03:58,754
What did you do in the hospital?

100
00:03:58,754 --> 00:04:00,754
I was a politician

101
00:04:00,754 --> 00:04:02,754
Konnichiwa

102
00:04:02,754 --> 00:04:04,754
OK, the second round

103
00:04:04,754 --> 00:04:06,754
What should I do?

104
00:04:06,754 --> 00:04:08,754
I think everything is real after the
first round

105
00:04:08,754 --> 00:04:10,754
I think everything is real after the
first round

106
00:04:10,754 --> 00:04:12,754
I have to say where it's truly normal

107
00:04:12,754 --> 00:04:16,754
Do ordinary people do that too?

108
00:04:16,754 --> 00:04:18,754
Yasumoto and Izumo

109
00:04:18,754 --> 00:04:23,754
Places forå…¶ ounces

110
00:04:23,754 --> 00:04:28,234
Maybe a small town

111
00:04:28,234 --> 00:04:30,234
Because others are using it

112
00:04:30,234 --> 00:04:33,234
The quote I chose is the real quote.

113
00:04:34,496 --> 00:04:36,496
Correct!

114
00:04:37,850 --> 00:04:40,850
Wow, it's Ichiro-san, the major leaguer

115
00:04:40,850 --> 00:04:42,850
Oh, I didn't know that

116
00:04:42,850 --> 00:04:43,850
Wow

117
00:04:43,850 --> 00:04:45,850
That's the sound effect

118
00:04:45,850 --> 00:04:47,850
Wow, it's Ichiro-san

119
00:04:47,850 --> 00:04:48,850
I'm glad

120
00:04:48,850 --> 00:04:49,850
I didn't know that

121
00:04:49,850 --> 00:04:51,850
Everything is awesome, it might be real

122
00:04:51,850 --> 00:04:53,850
The third one is Ai-chan

123
00:04:53,850 --> 00:04:55,850
I'll go with this one

124
00:04:55,850 --> 00:04:58,850
Wait, isn't there a more safe one?

125
00:04:58,850 --> 00:04:59,850
Safe one?

126
00:04:59,850 --> 00:05:00,850
I'll go with this one

127
00:05:00,850 --> 00:05:05,850
I'm not designing clothes, I'm designing
dreams

128
00:05:05,850 --> 00:05:07,850
It's cool to read like this

129
00:05:07,850 --> 00:05:10,850
I want to say something like this

130
00:05:10,850 --> 00:05:13,850
This quote is the real one

131
00:05:15,850 --> 00:05:16,850
Wow

132
00:05:16,850 --> 00:05:18,522
Thank you!

133
00:05:18,522 --> 00:05:22,522
I'm Ralph Lauren, a fashion designer

134
00:05:22,522 --> 00:05:26,522
I'm a brand

135
00:05:27,522 --> 00:05:30,522
What kind of dream do you have?

136
00:05:30,522 --> 00:05:32,522
What kind of design?

137
00:05:32,522 --> 00:05:35,522
I want to go to the island of red and
white

138
00:05:35,522 --> 00:05:36,522
You are serious

139
00:05:36,522 --> 00:05:39,522
I'm thinking if I can make it or not

140
00:05:39,522 --> 00:05:42,522
It's hard to make a dream come true

141
00:05:42,522 --> 00:05:43,522
You are going to be a celebrity

142
00:05:43,522 --> 00:05:45,522
I didn't understand what you said

143
00:05:45,522 --> 00:05:48,522
If you think if you can make it or not

144
00:05:48,522 --> 00:05:51,522
It's hard to make a dream come true

145
00:05:51,522 --> 00:05:53,522
Shibuya Yasumoto

146
00:05:53,522 --> 00:05:57,522
No laughter, no one understands, no
response

147
00:05:57,522 --> 00:05:59,522
That was the worst

148
00:06:00,522 --> 00:06:02,522
Hello

149
00:06:02,522 --> 00:06:05,522
Are we good at this?

150
00:06:05,522 --> 00:06:08,522
We are stupid, so we are not good at
this

151
00:06:08,522 --> 00:06:09,522
Really

152
00:06:09,522 --> 00:06:12,522
I'm curious about this

153
00:06:12,522 --> 00:06:14,522
This is hard

154
00:06:14,522 --> 00:06:17,522
I think there is a time

155
00:06:17,522 --> 00:06:20,522
Time is

156
00:06:20,522 --> 00:06:23,522
The quote I chose is the real quote

157
00:06:25,056 --> 00:06:28,056
So cute!

158
00:06:28,752 --> 00:06:29,752
I knew it!

159
00:06:30,752 --> 00:06:33,752
Alexandra Vinesa, a private scholar

160
00:06:33,752 --> 00:06:34,752
No, no, no

161
00:06:36,752 --> 00:06:38,752
What is a private scholar?

162
00:06:39,752 --> 00:06:40,752
A private scholar

163
00:06:40,752 --> 00:06:41,752
I see

164
00:06:42,752 --> 00:06:44,752
Do you do anything to improve yourself?

165
00:06:44,752 --> 00:06:45,752
To shorten the time

166
00:06:45,752 --> 00:06:46,752
To work hard

167
00:06:46,752 --> 00:06:47,752
To work hard for what?

168
00:06:47,752 --> 00:06:49,752
I don't know, what am I working hard
for?

169
00:06:49,752 --> 00:06:51,752
Maybe I'm not working hard

170
00:06:51,752 --> 00:06:52,752
I don't know

171
00:06:52,752 --> 00:06:53,752
I don't know

172
00:06:53,752 --> 00:06:55,752
I don't know

173
00:06:55,752 --> 00:06:56,752
I don't know

174
00:06:56,752 --> 00:06:58,752
This is the last one

175
00:06:58,752 --> 00:07:00,752
You can't be so relaxed

176
00:07:00,752 --> 00:07:02,752
I'm scared, this is the last one

177
00:07:02,752 --> 00:07:03,752
This is the last one

178
00:07:04,752 --> 00:07:05,752
Did you get it?

179
00:07:05,752 --> 00:07:07,752
It says speed

180
00:07:07,752 --> 00:07:08,752
It's fast

181
00:07:09,752 --> 00:07:15,752
If you ride it, you can go forward
without looking at anything

182
00:07:15,752 --> 00:07:16,752
You don't look around

183
00:07:16,752 --> 00:07:17,752
You don't look around

184
00:07:17,752 --> 00:07:18,752
You don't look around

185
00:07:18,752 --> 00:07:19,752
Yes

186
00:07:20,752 --> 00:07:22,752
You don't look around, you can go
forward

187
00:07:22,752 --> 00:07:24,752
You don't think about unnecessary things

188
00:07:24,752 --> 00:07:27,752
The answer is the real one

189
00:07:30,296 --> 00:07:31,296
I'm sorry!

190
00:07:31,296 --> 00:07:32,296
I'm sorry!

191
00:07:34,296 --> 00:07:35,296
I'm sorry!

192
