00:00:11,658 --> 00:00:13,658
I'm sleepy.

5
00:00:13,658 --> 00:00:16,832
Thank you.

6
00:00:16,832 --> 00:00:21,132
Four days after the announcement of new
members,

7
00:00:21,132 --> 00:00:24,632
the three of them visited a studio in
the city.

8
00:00:26,092 --> 00:00:27,832
The reason is...

9
00:00:28,672 --> 00:00:31,512
We'll be editing for DLP.

10
00:00:31,512 --> 00:00:32,512
Please.

11
00:00:32,512 --> 00:00:33,512
Please.

12
00:00:33,512 --> 00:00:36,172
What's the theme?

13
00:00:36,172 --> 00:00:38,592
This is a magazine shoot.

14
00:00:39,212 --> 00:00:41,512
It's my first time.

15
00:00:42,012 --> 00:00:43,252
I'm looking forward to it.

16
00:00:43,252 --> 00:00:46,252
The first job for the new members.

17
00:00:46,252 --> 00:00:49,252
The content is a magazine interview.

18
00:00:49,252 --> 00:00:58,512
DLP is the title of the magazine.

19
00:00:58,512 --> 00:01:10,112
Any Commander can see the new program by
such a fashionhu

20
00:01:10,672 --> 00:01:17,672
It is a very meaningful magazine that
was involved in the creation of the
memorial book of the 10th anniversary of
the founding of the country.

21
00:01:18,672 --> 00:01:23,672
So this time, we will be close to the
first job of the new members

22
00:01:23,672 --> 00:01:29,672
New member audition, close and training,

24
00:01:36,672 --> 00:01:41,672
The interview of BLT, the first job of
the new members, has begun

25
00:01:43,672 --> 00:01:45,672
First, individual interview

26
00:01:46,672 --> 00:01:48,672
What is your favorite animal?

27
00:01:48,672 --> 00:01:53,672
My favorite animal is the omelet, panda,
lion, elephant

28
00:01:55,672 --> 00:01:56,672
And gorilla

29
00:01:58,672 --> 00:01:59,672
What is your favorite animal?

00:02:03,672 --> 00:02:06,672
I like the gorilla

33
00:02:06,672 --> 00:02:08,672
What is your favorite animal?

34
00:02:08,672 --> 00:02:11,672
I don't like the gorilla

35
00:02:11,672 --> 00:02:15,672
I think I can do what I have learned so
far

36
00:02:16,672 --> 00:02:20,672
I learned to do it, but I'm the only one
who can do it

37
00:02:20,672 --> 00:02:22,672
I want to do it with you, so

38
00:02:22,672 --> 00:02:24,672
I can't do it

39
00:02:24,672 --> 00:02:26,672
I can't do it

40
00:02:27,672 --> 00:02:29,672
Next, Kokona

41
00:02:30,672 --> 00:02:32,672
What is your favorite animal?

42
00:02:32,672 --> 00:02:42,672
I like the movie, the dinosaur, the
shark, the movie of the movie

43
00:02:45,672 --> 00:02:47,672
The giant shark attacks humans

44
00:02:47,672 --> 00:02:50,672
What is the difference between the
dinosaur and the shark?

45
00:02:50,672 --> 00:02:52,672
I like the dinosaur

46
00:02:52,672 --> 00:02:54,672
I see

47
00:02:55,672 --> 00:03:00,672
For some reason, it is clear that she
likes the shark movie

48
00:03:00,672 --> 00:03:02,672
And Nono-Kawa

49
00:03:05,672 --> 00:03:07,672
What is your name?

50
00:03:07,672 --> 00:03:09,672
My name is Nono-chan

51
00:03:09,672 --> 00:03:11,672
I'm the only one who can't do it

52
00:03:11,672 --> 00:03:14,672
I'm the only one who can't do it

53
00:03:14,672 --> 00:03:16,672
I'm sorry

54
00:03:16,672 --> 00:03:18,672
What kind of job?

55
00:03:18,672 --> 00:03:20,672
I don't know, I'm not sure

56
00:03:20,672 --> 00:03:22,672
I'm not sure

57
00:03:22,672 --> 00:03:24,672
I see

58
00:03:24,672 --> 00:03:26,672
I'm not sure

59
00:03:27,672 --> 00:03:29,672
Is this your first time doing an
interview?

60
00:03:29,672 --> 00:03:31,672
Yes, it is

61
00:03:31,672 --> 00:03:33,672
I'm so excited

62
00:03:33,672 --> 00:03:35,672
Thank you

63
00:03:35,672 --> 00:03:37,672
I'm so excited

64
00:03:37,672 --> 00:03:41,824
Thank you

65
00:03:41,824 --> 00:03:46,664
Three new members answered many
questions

66
00:03:46,664 --> 00:03:50,364
In fact, they answered the same question

67
00:03:51,324 --> 00:03:52,824
What are you the happiest lately?

68
00:03:53,484 --> 00:03:55,204
What? The booking built by Big Brother

69
00:03:56,604 --> 00:03:57,484
The booking built by New Year's hand

70
00:03:57,484 --> 00:03:57,964
I see

71
00:03:59,704 --> 00:04:01,084
Then, where are they now?

72
00:04:01,364 --> 00:04:04,404
They are�만 now

73
00:04:05,744 --> 00:04:08,324
They are now plantingラビア

74
00:04:08,324 --> 00:04:10,324
The three of them are very motivated to
work.

75
00:04:10,324 --> 00:04:12,324
They are challenging to take a video of
the gravure.

76
00:04:13,324 --> 00:04:16,324
They are ready to take a video of the
clothes they prepared for this day.

77
00:04:16,324 --> 00:04:23,376
They are posing according to the request
of professional cameramen.

78
00:04:23,376 --> 00:04:25,376
Please take a little bit lower.

79
00:04:27,376 --> 00:04:28,376
Good.

80
00:04:34,376 --> 00:04:36,376
Good. Please take it like that.

81
00:04:38,376 --> 00:04:39,376
Good.

82
00:04:39,376 --> 00:04:40,376
How is your mental state?

83
00:04:40,376 --> 00:04:41,376
It's good.

84
00:04:41,376 --> 00:04:42,376
It's strange.

85
00:04:43,376 --> 00:04:48,376
In the meantime, Nonoka stares at the
shooting of Kokona.

86
00:04:48,376 --> 00:04:52,376
Amazing.

87
00:04:52,768 --> 00:04:55,468
I don't like shooting magazines.

88
00:04:55,468 --> 00:04:57,068
I'm a freshman.

89
00:04:57,068 --> 00:04:58,268
I'm a freshman.

90
00:04:58,268 --> 00:04:59,768
I like it.

91
00:05:02,768 --> 00:05:04,648
Nonoka is the youngest.

92
00:05:04,648 --> 00:05:06,268
She has no experience of shooting,

93
00:05:06,268 --> 00:05:08,768
compared to her younger sister, Yuno.

94
00:05:08,768 --> 00:05:12,944
Nonoka's

95
00:05:12,944 --> 00:05:17,944
Then, when he saw Nonoka, the head of
Fujii

96
00:05:17,944 --> 00:05:21,944
Every day, I go to the doctor

97
00:05:21,944 --> 00:05:24,944
I have a big face and a big face

98
00:05:24,944 --> 00:05:30,944
I have a big face and a big face

99
00:05:30,944 --> 00:05:34,944
I give advice for shooting

100
00:05:34,944 --> 00:05:37,944
And finally

101
00:05:37,944 --> 00:05:44,944
I give advice for shooting

102
00:05:44,944 --> 00:05:49,944
I give advice for shooting

103
00:05:49,944 --> 00:05:54,944
As he said, he changes his facial
expression for each shutter

104
00:05:54,944 --> 00:05:57,944
I'm a little worried about the
awkwardness

105
00:05:57,944 --> 00:05:59,944
What do you like to eat?

106
00:05:59,944 --> 00:06:02,944
I like to eat dumplings

107
00:06:02,944 --> 00:06:07,944
You make dumplings?

108
00:06:07,944 --> 00:06:12,944
I have about 200 dumplings at home

109
00:06:12,944 --> 00:06:15,944
Really?

110
00:06:15,944 --> 00:06:19,944
He is relaxed because of a chat

111
00:06:19,944 --> 00:06:27,944
He is a full-face Emi

112
00:06:28,432 --> 00:06:31,432
And the movement is light

113
00:06:34,432 --> 00:06:37,432
Thank you for the meal

114
00:06:39,432 --> 00:06:40,432
How was the shooting?

115
00:06:40,432 --> 00:06:41,432
It was fun

116
00:06:42,432 --> 00:06:45,432
I was told that I was moving dynamically

117
00:06:47,432 --> 00:06:50,432
Next, photo shooting with all three
members

118
00:06:54,432 --> 00:06:56,432
Are you ready?

119
00:06:56,432 --> 00:06:57,904
OK

120
00:06:57,904 --> 00:06:59,324
It's hard

121
00:07:01,564 --> 00:07:04,104
The three quickly have to makeJE на

122
00:07:06,644 --> 00:07:10,264
The people returning any curious about玉

123
00:07:10,264 --> 00:07:13,264
They continued to take commemorative
photos for a long time.

124
00:07:19,290 --> 00:07:26,930
gels

125
00:07:26,930 --> 00:07:29,950
All pictures have been taken

126
00:07:29,950 --> 00:07:31,850
тех

127
00:07:31,850 --> 00:07:32,910
Super special Four See Ie

The new member, Glavia, is on sale!

130
00:07:50,738 --> 00:07:54,738
And the new member who finished her
first job is...

131
00:07:54,738 --> 00:07:58,738
It's my first time. It's all my first
time.

132
00:07:58,738 --> 00:08:00,738
Did you do well?

133
00:08:00,738 --> 00:08:04,738
Yes, I've been told that I'm cute.

134
00:08:04,738 --> 00:08:09,008
I'm doing well in various ways.

135
00:08:09,008 --> 00:08:13,348
I was asked a lot of questions.

136
00:08:13,348 --> 00:08:16,656
I think it's good to think about it.

137
00:08:16,656 --> 00:08:18,656
I was really nervous at first.

138
00:08:18,656 --> 00:08:22,656
There were a lot of people around me, so
I was really nervous.

139
00:08:22,656 --> 00:08:25,656
I was shooting with three people
outside.

140
00:08:25,656 --> 00:08:27,656
I think that was fun.

141
00:08:27,656 --> 00:08:29,656
It was fun.

142
00:08:29,656 --> 00:08:31,656
I thought I was in the middle of an MV.

143
00:08:31,656 --> 00:08:34,656
I thought this would continue forever.

144
00:08:34,656 --> 00:08:40,544
It's been a long time, but I'll do my
best.

145
00:08:40,544 --> 00:08:43,904
Please look forward to their future
activities.

146
00:08:45,684 --> 00:08:46,684
Next time...

147
00:08:46,684 --> 00:09:01,961
Please look forward to their future
activities.
