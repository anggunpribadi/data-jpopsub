1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
includes movie videos from Ebi!

2
00:00:13,400 --> 00:00:10,700
Now we are going to

3
00:00:14,380 --> 00:00:16,340
take a walk!

4
00:00:16,680 --> 00:00:18,400
Today the second part of today's
introduce

5
00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:20,600
is Naita Visit!

6
00:00:21,180 --> 00:00:23,480
Today I want to take a walk

7
00:00:23,480 --> 00:00:00,280
Last time we were here when I

8
00:00:25,280 --> 00:00:26,820
appeared from the bottom

9
00:00:26,820 --> 00:00:32,820
I think I got a lot of compliments from
the fans.

10
00:00:32,820 --> 00:00:36,820
I thought so, but today I don't have a
single pigeon.

11
00:00:36,820 --> 00:00:38,820
I'm not there.

12
00:00:38,820 --> 00:00:41,820
I came up from the stairs.

13
00:00:41,820 --> 00:00:47,820
I don't know if it's a good thing, but
I'd like to go for a walk right away.

14
00:00:47,820 --> 00:00:49,820
Let's go!

15
00:00:49,820 --> 00:00:54,820
So this is a store near the station.

16
00:00:54,820 --> 00:00:59,820
Actually, there's a music video for the
23rd Summer Night.

17
00:00:59,820 --> 00:01:04,820
There's an individual version.

18
00:01:04,820 --> 00:01:09,820
It's on the fan club.

19
00:01:09,820 --> 00:01:13,820
I used to eat dumplings here.

20
00:01:13,820 --> 00:01:18,820
I took a lot of pictures and used them
on the music video.

21
00:01:18,820 --> 00:01:33,820
I came here and I thought I could
introduce you to the Atachi of the
Summer Night.

22
00:01:33,820 --> 00:01:38,820
As I walked, I passed this road.

23
00:01:38,820 --> 00:01:41,820
I was taking a picture of the music
video.

24
00:01:41,820 --> 00:01:44,820
There's a toy store here.

25
00:01:44,820 --> 00:01:54,820
I was looking at the toy and I went to a
different place.

26
00:01:54,820 --> 00:01:59,820
Last time, I couldn't use this camera.

27
00:01:59,820 --> 00:02:04,820
I was in the picture all the time.

28
00:02:04,820 --> 00:02:10,820
Today I'm going to use this camera.

29
00:02:10,820 --> 00:02:14,820
This is a delicious sandwich shop.

30
00:02:14,820 --> 00:02:20,820
Where did I go?

31
00:02:20,820 --> 00:02:24,820
Where did I go?

32
00:02:24,820 --> 00:02:27,820
Did I go this way?

33
00:02:27,820 --> 00:02:29,820
Where did I go?

34
00:02:29,820 --> 00:02:31,820
I found the pedestrian bridge.

35
00:02:31,820 --> 00:02:33,820
I'm going to take a picture of the
pedestrian bridge.

36
00:02:33,820 --> 00:02:41,820
It's raining while I'm taking pictures
of the music video.

37
00:02:41,820 --> 00:02:45,820
I didn't have a camera.

38
00:02:45,820 --> 00:02:49,820
I was in a bad mood.

39
00:02:49,820 --> 00:02:54,820
I found it.

40
00:02:54,820 --> 00:03:00,820
I took a picture of the pedestrian
bridge.

41
00:03:00,820 --> 00:03:03,820
It was raining and I was wearing a
umbrella.

42
00:03:03,820 --> 00:03:09,820
I didn't know that I was taking pictures
of the pedestrian bridge.

43
00:03:09,820 --> 00:03:14,820
I was wearing an umbrella.

44
00:03:14,820 --> 00:03:16,820
I'm in the pedestrian bridge.

45
00:03:16,820 --> 00:03:25,820
I was in the picture of the Atachi of
the Summer Night.

46
00:03:25,820 --> 00:03:28,820
I left it.

47
00:03:28,820 --> 00:03:37,820
I went to a place called KAHOSAKE when I
was 20 years old.

48
00:03:37,820 --> 00:03:40,820
Do you remember this place?

49
00:03:40,820 --> 00:03:48,820
This is the place where I went to
KAHOSAKE last time.

50
00:03:48,820 --> 00:03:52,820
Let's go there.

51
00:03:52,820 --> 00:04:02,820
There are people who know this place.

52
00:04:02,820 --> 00:04:08,820
Let's interview them.

53
00:04:08,820 --> 00:04:14,820
Do you remember this place?

54
00:04:14,820 --> 00:04:22,820
This is the place where I went to
KAHOSAKE last time.

55
00:04:22,820 --> 00:04:26,820
Let's go there.

56
00:04:26,820 --> 00:04:29,820
What?

57
00:04:29,820 --> 00:04:36,820
There are people who know this place.

58
00:04:36,820 --> 00:04:43,820
Let's interview them.

59
00:04:43,820 --> 00:04:45,820
I'm sorry.

60
00:04:45,820 --> 00:04:48,820
Who are you?

61
00:04:48,820 --> 00:04:51,820
Who are you?

62
00:04:51,820 --> 00:04:55,820
You know this place, right?

63
00:04:55,820 --> 00:04:57,820
I know you.

64
00:04:57,820 --> 00:04:59,820
I was in Machimura.

65
00:04:59,820 --> 00:05:03,820
I usually drink tea.

66
00:05:03,820 --> 00:05:05,820
Really?

67
00:05:05,820 --> 00:05:09,820
I didn't know that.

68
00:05:09,820 --> 00:05:12,820
I'm Rataima.

69
00:05:12,820 --> 00:05:14,820
You are lying.

70
00:05:14,820 --> 00:05:17,820
I'm wrong.

71
00:05:17,820 --> 00:05:19,820
Did you come to Machimura?

72
00:05:19,820 --> 00:05:22,820
I came to Machimura.

73
00:05:22,820 --> 00:05:26,820
You brought a camera.

74
00:05:26,820 --> 00:05:28,820
What are you drinking?

75
00:05:28,820 --> 00:05:30,820
I'm asking you something.

76
00:05:30,820 --> 00:05:33,820
I'm sorry.

77
00:05:33,820 --> 00:05:36,820
Do you have orange juice?

78
00:05:36,820 --> 00:05:39,820
Yes, I have.

79
00:05:39,820 --> 00:05:42,820
What are you drinking?

80
00:05:42,820 --> 00:05:45,820
I'm drinking tea.

81
00:05:45,820 --> 00:05:49,820
You are drinking tea.

82
00:05:49,820 --> 00:05:51,820
I drink tea.

83
00:05:51,820 --> 00:05:53,820
Can you drink tea?

84
00:05:53,820 --> 00:05:55,820
I'm thirsty.

85
00:05:55,820 --> 00:05:58,820
I'm drinking orange juice.

86
00:05:58,820 --> 00:06:01,820
I drank orange juice.

87
00:06:01,820 --> 00:06:03,820
I'm drinking.

88
00:06:03,820 --> 00:06:05,820
Cheers.

89
00:06:05,820 --> 00:06:07,820
It's dangerous.

90
00:06:07,820 --> 00:06:09,820
It's dangerous.

91
00:06:09,820 --> 00:06:15,820
I'm walking on the street.

92
00:06:15,820 --> 00:06:17,820
I'm walking on the street.

93
00:06:17,820 --> 00:06:19,820
Thank you.

94
00:06:19,820 --> 00:06:24,820
I'm thirsty.

95
00:06:24,820 --> 00:06:26,820
I'm not dehydrated.

96
00:06:26,820 --> 00:06:28,820
I'm walking.

97
00:06:28,820 --> 00:06:30,820
I'm walking.

98
00:06:30,820 --> 00:06:32,820
I'm walking.

99
00:06:32,820 --> 00:06:34,820
I'm walking.

100
00:06:34,820 --> 00:06:37,820
Thank you.

101
00:06:37,820 --> 00:06:40,820
Have you ever been to Machimura?

102
00:06:40,820 --> 00:06:42,820
I haven't.

103
00:06:42,820 --> 00:06:43,820
I've been here for the first time.

104
00:06:43,820 --> 00:06:45,820
I've been here for the second time.

105
00:06:45,820 --> 00:06:50,820
I don't know much about Machimura.

106
00:06:50,820 --> 00:06:56,820
I've been here with you three times.

107
00:06:56,820 --> 00:07:03,820
I went to eat with you.

108
00:07:03,820 --> 00:07:06,820
I haven't been here for the first time.

109
00:07:06,820 --> 00:07:08,820
It was the second time.

110
00:07:08,820 --> 00:07:12,820
I feel like I've been walking with you
all night.

111
00:07:12,820 --> 00:07:18,820
I came to celebrate the 10th
anniversary.

112
00:07:18,820 --> 00:07:25,820
There is a sake stand in Kamazaki.

113
00:07:25,820 --> 00:07:28,820
Let's take a walk.

114
00:07:28,820 --> 00:07:30,820
Please guide me.

115
00:07:30,820 --> 00:07:37,820
I feel like I'm in Okinawa.

116
00:07:37,820 --> 00:07:39,820
I want to go to Okinawa.

117
00:07:39,820 --> 00:07:42,820
I remember.

118
00:07:42,820 --> 00:07:44,820
I remember.

119
00:07:44,820 --> 00:07:47,820
This is the sake stand.

120
00:07:47,820 --> 00:07:50,820
I ate this two years ago.

121
00:07:50,820 --> 00:07:52,820
That's right.

122
00:07:52,820 --> 00:07:55,820
It's a year ago.

123
00:07:55,820 --> 00:07:58,820
There is a tea here.

124
00:07:58,820 --> 00:08:00,820
I drank tea.

125
00:08:00,820 --> 00:08:03,820
There is a tea shop here.

126
00:08:03,820 --> 00:08:06,820
There is a tea shop here.

127
00:08:06,820 --> 00:08:09,820
Hello.

128
00:08:09,820 --> 00:08:11,820
You are kind.

129
00:08:11,820 --> 00:08:13,820
Hello.

130
00:08:13,820 --> 00:08:15,820
You are kind.

131
00:08:15,820 --> 00:08:17,820
I want to drink.

132
00:08:17,820 --> 00:08:19,820
I want to drink.

133
00:08:19,820 --> 00:08:21,820
Let's go.

134
00:08:21,820 --> 00:08:24,820
This is a sake stand.

135
00:08:24,820 --> 00:08:29,820
I was walking with you.

136
00:08:29,820 --> 00:08:36,820
RICO was walking with me.

137
00:08:36,820 --> 00:08:41,820
I noticed that you were walking with me.

138
00:08:41,820 --> 00:08:44,820
We finished walking together.

139
00:08:44,820 --> 00:08:49,820
I think you were already expecting it.

140
00:08:49,820 --> 00:08:54,820
I came alone to Kamazaki.

141
00:08:54,820 --> 00:08:58,820
My friends were walking together.

142
00:08:58,820 --> 00:09:03,820
I want to drink with RICO.

143
00:09:03,820 --> 00:09:12,820
Last time I came alone, I drank with a
sake stand T-shirt.

144
00:09:12,820 --> 00:09:21,820
I want to wear it again.

145
00:09:21,820 --> 00:09:23,820
I will change clothes.

146
00:09:23,820 --> 00:09:26,820
I will change clothes.

147
00:09:26,820 --> 00:09:30,820
I will change clothes.

148
00:09:30,820 --> 00:09:32,820
I will change clothes.

149
00:09:36,820 --> 00:09:40,820
I changed clothes.

150
00:09:40,820 --> 00:09:43,820
This is a sake stand.

151
00:09:43,820 --> 00:09:44,820
This is a winter version.

152
00:09:44,820 --> 00:09:47,820
This is a trainer.

153
00:09:47,820 --> 00:09:48,820
This is red.

154
00:09:48,820 --> 00:09:50,820
I am wearing a full-body jacket.

155
00:09:50,820 --> 00:09:52,820
I can't see my whole body.

156
00:09:52,820 --> 00:09:54,820
My whole body is red.

157
00:09:54,820 --> 00:10:00,820
I think I can drink slowly.

158
00:10:00,820 --> 00:10:08,820
I want to become an adult and say
something.

159
00:10:08,820 --> 00:10:10,820
Adults often ask for a drink.

160
00:10:10,820 --> 00:10:15,820
I want to go to a store and say
something.

161
00:10:15,820 --> 00:10:18,820
I want to ask for a drink.

162
00:10:18,820 --> 00:10:22,820
Please say it.

163
00:10:22,820 --> 00:10:24,820
I will say it.

164
00:10:24,820 --> 00:10:26,820
Please say it.

165
00:10:26,820 --> 00:10:28,820
I will say it for the first time.

166
00:10:28,820 --> 00:10:30,820
I'm sorry.

167
00:10:30,820 --> 00:10:32,820
I will say it in person.

168
00:10:32,820 --> 00:10:35,820
I will say it in two.

169
00:10:35,820 --> 00:10:37,820
I am an adult.

170
00:10:37,820 --> 00:10:44,820
Adults often ask for a drink.

171
00:10:44,820 --> 00:10:49,820
I drink beer for the first time.

172
00:10:49,820 --> 00:10:54,820
I have never drunk beer.

173
00:10:54,820 --> 00:10:57,820
I want to drink with RICO.

174
00:10:57,820 --> 00:11:02,820
I said it on my birthday.

175
00:11:02,820 --> 00:11:05,820
I said it for 4 months.

176
00:11:05,820 --> 00:11:09,820
I am already drinking.

177
00:11:09,820 --> 00:11:13,820
I turned 20 on October 28.

178
00:11:13,820 --> 00:11:15,820
I was born early.

179
00:11:15,820 --> 00:11:18,820
I was born early.

180
00:11:18,820 --> 00:11:20,820
I'm worried.

181
00:11:20,820 --> 00:11:23,820
Thank you.

182
00:11:23,820 --> 00:11:26,820
What happened?

183
00:11:26,820 --> 00:11:29,820
I'm scared.

184
00:11:29,820 --> 00:11:33,820
I'm scared.

185
00:11:33,820 --> 00:11:35,820
I'm nervous.

186
00:11:35,820 --> 00:11:37,820
I will drink.

187
00:11:37,820 --> 00:11:40,820
I will drink.

188
00:11:40,820 --> 00:11:43,820
I'm scared.

189
00:11:43,820 --> 00:11:45,820
I will drink.

190
00:11:50,820 --> 00:11:55,820
I'm scared.

191
00:11:55,820 --> 00:11:57,820
I can drink.

192
00:11:57,820 --> 00:11:59,820
I can drink.

193
00:11:59,820 --> 00:12:01,820
I can drink.

194
00:12:01,820 --> 00:12:06,820
The glass is cold.

195
00:12:06,820 --> 00:12:09,820
Adults drink beer.

196
00:12:09,820 --> 00:12:13,820
Many people work hard.

197
00:12:13,820 --> 00:12:16,820
Is it because I drink beer at the store?

198
00:12:16,820 --> 00:12:18,820
It's easy to drink.

199
00:12:18,820 --> 00:12:20,820
I thought so.

200
00:12:20,820 --> 00:12:22,820
What did you drink last time?

201
00:12:22,820 --> 00:12:24,820
I drank salmon beer.

202
00:12:24,820 --> 00:12:26,820
Salmon beer?

203
00:12:26,820 --> 00:12:28,820
I want you to order later.

204
00:12:28,820 --> 00:12:29,820
OK.

205
00:12:29,820 --> 00:12:30,820
What's in the sake?

206
00:12:30,820 --> 00:12:32,820
Soy milk in the sake.

207
00:12:32,820 --> 00:12:34,820
What? Soy milk?

208
00:12:34,820 --> 00:12:36,820
Is it broken?

209
00:12:36,820 --> 00:12:38,820
It was really delicious.

210
00:12:38,820 --> 00:12:42,820
I'll order it after I finish drinking
beer.

211
00:12:42,820 --> 00:12:44,820
I'm nervous.

212
00:12:44,820 --> 00:12:46,820
I've never seen it before.

213
00:12:46,820 --> 00:12:48,820
What was it?

214
00:12:48,820 --> 00:12:50,820
Saitan live streaming?

215
00:12:50,820 --> 00:12:52,820
Saitan live streaming.

216
00:12:52,820 --> 00:12:54,820
I've seen it since the countdown.

217
00:12:54,820 --> 00:12:56,820
I know.

218
00:12:56,820 --> 00:12:58,820
I'm excited.

219
00:12:58,820 --> 00:13:00,820
I'm excited.

220
00:13:00,820 --> 00:13:02,820
It's delicious.

221
00:13:02,820 --> 00:13:04,820
It's easy to drink.

222
00:13:04,820 --> 00:13:06,820
It's delicious.

223
00:13:06,820 --> 00:13:08,820
Do you drink beer?

224
00:13:08,820 --> 00:13:10,820
I don't drink beer.

225
00:13:10,820 --> 00:13:12,820
After the live streaming,

226
00:13:12,820 --> 00:13:14,820
I drank Ebisu beer.

227
00:13:14,820 --> 00:13:16,820
I was curious about it.

228
00:13:16,820 --> 00:13:18,820
I drank it because I was curious.

229
00:13:18,820 --> 00:13:20,820
It was bitter.

230
00:13:20,820 --> 00:13:22,820
It was a little early.

231
00:13:22,820 --> 00:13:24,820
Since then?

232
00:13:24,820 --> 00:13:26,820
It's delicious.

233
00:13:26,820 --> 00:13:28,820
It was bitter.

234
00:13:28,820 --> 00:13:30,820
It was a birthday magic.

235
00:13:30,820 --> 00:13:32,820
It was delicious.

236
00:13:32,820 --> 00:13:34,820
I thought it was delicious.

237
00:13:34,820 --> 00:13:36,820
I drank it after a while.

238
00:13:36,820 --> 00:13:38,820
I was wondering if it was bitter.

239
00:13:38,820 --> 00:13:40,820
It was a birthday magic.

240
00:13:40,820 --> 00:13:42,820
It was a little bitter.

241
00:13:42,820 --> 00:13:44,820
It's amazing.

242
00:13:44,820 --> 00:13:46,820
It's easy to drink.

243
00:13:46,820 --> 00:13:48,820
I like beer that's not that bitter.

244
00:13:48,820 --> 00:13:50,820
I'm drinking it now.

245
00:13:50,820 --> 00:13:52,820
I asked Rika-chan.

246
00:13:52,820 --> 00:13:54,820
What's a beer that's easy to drink?

247
00:13:54,820 --> 00:13:56,820
I asked her.

248
00:13:56,820 --> 00:13:58,820
I'm writing down my phone numbers.

249
00:13:58,820 --> 00:14:00,820
I want to drink it.

250
00:14:00,820 --> 00:14:02,820
It's good.

251
00:14:02,820 --> 00:14:04,820
I'm looking forward to it.

252
00:14:04,820 --> 00:14:06,820
What would you like to order?

253
00:14:06,820 --> 00:14:08,820
I'd like to order a chanjacheep.

254
00:14:08,820 --> 00:14:10,820
I like it.

255
00:14:10,820 --> 00:14:12,820
I'd like to order a chanjacheep.

256
00:14:12,820 --> 00:14:14,820
What should I order?

257
00:14:14,820 --> 00:14:16,820
It's a snack.

258
00:14:16,820 --> 00:14:18,820
I'd like to order a long potato kimchi.

259
00:14:18,820 --> 00:14:20,820
I want to eat it.

260
00:14:20,820 --> 00:14:24,820
The long potato kimchi we ate last time
was delicious.

261
00:14:26,820 --> 00:14:28,820
It was delicious.

262
00:14:28,820 --> 00:14:30,820
I'm not sure what to order.

263
00:14:30,820 --> 00:14:32,820
It looks delicious.

264
00:14:32,820 --> 00:14:34,820
It's a Japanese rice cake.

265
00:14:34,820 --> 00:14:36,820
Rika-chan likes it.

266
00:14:36,820 --> 00:14:38,820
I like it.

267
00:14:38,820 --> 00:14:40,820
I asked her.

268
00:14:40,820 --> 00:14:42,820
I'm not sure what to order.

269
00:14:42,820 --> 00:14:44,820
I'm sorry.

270
00:14:44,820 --> 00:14:51,620
investigatory cheese, ground beef, fried
over feeling longer

271
00:14:51,620 --> 00:14:54,040
eat long experiência

272
00:14:54,040 --> 00:14:56,620
this shop made of sweet potato

273
00:14:56,620 --> 00:14:59,100
Japanese

274
00:14:59,100 --> 00:15:04,920
I like both of them

275
00:15:04,920 --> 00:15:07,880
Do you drink when you

276
00:15:07,880 --> 00:15:11,640
drink, do you eat together Ahetsu

277
00:15:11,640 --> 00:15:15,320
I drank with my friends at home.

278
00:15:15,320 --> 00:15:16,320
Thank you.

279
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:18,320
I drank with my friends outside.

280
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:20,320
I drank standing up.

281
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:22,320
That's fast.

282
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:24,320
You drank a lot of sopan.

283
00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:32,320
I think it's easy for girls to drink.

284
00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:34,320
I'm glad.

285
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:36,320
I'm glad I'm your friend.

286
00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:38,320
It's my first time.

287
00:15:38,320 --> 00:15:40,320
It's already fun.

288
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:42,320
It's really fun.

289
00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:46,320
We drank together on the day of the
trip.

290
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:48,320
We drank plum wine.

291
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:52,320
I liked plum wine.

292
00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:56,320
Riko recommended it to me.

293
00:15:56,320 --> 00:16:02,320
I drank Japanese sake a few days ago.

294
00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:10,320
I drank Japanese sake with my friends.

295
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:12,320
It was fun.

296
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:18,320
I didn't think it would be such a day.

297
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:26,320
I felt like I was in the middle of a
relationship.

298
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:30,320
I thought I was going to be 20 years
old.

299
00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:34,320
I went to eat with my mother after I
turned 20.

300
00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:36,320
I liked oolong tea.

301
00:16:36,320 --> 00:16:38,320
I wanted to order oolong tea.

302
00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:42,320
I asked my mother to order oolong tea.

303
00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:48,320
I didn't think it would be such a day.

304
00:16:48,320 --> 00:16:52,320
I drank tea with my mother.

305
00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:54,320
I drank tea with my mother.

306
00:16:54,320 --> 00:16:56,320
It's fun.

307
00:16:56,320 --> 00:16:58,320
I'm going to be 20 years old.

308
00:16:58,320 --> 00:17:04,320
I didn't drink much.

309
00:17:04,320 --> 00:17:10,320
I'm still 20 years old.

310
00:17:10,320 --> 00:17:12,320
I saw you as a student.

311
00:17:12,320 --> 00:17:18,320
You have been playing soccer for two
years.

312
00:17:18,320 --> 00:17:20,320
I thought it was two years ago.

313
00:17:20,320 --> 00:17:22,320
I felt strange.

314
00:17:22,320 --> 00:17:24,320
I'm sorry.

315
00:17:24,320 --> 00:17:26,320
Thank you.

316
00:17:26,320 --> 00:17:28,320
I'm going to eat chanja.

317
00:17:28,320 --> 00:17:30,320
Can you eat chanja?

318
00:17:30,320 --> 00:17:32,320
I like it.

319
00:17:32,320 --> 00:17:34,320
It's a snack.

320
00:17:34,320 --> 00:17:36,320
I'm going to eat.

321
00:17:36,320 --> 00:17:38,320
I'm going to eat.

322
00:17:42,320 --> 00:17:44,320
Is it delicious?

323
00:17:46,320 --> 00:17:48,320
Is it spicy?

324
00:17:48,320 --> 00:17:50,320
It's a little spicy.

325
00:17:50,320 --> 00:17:52,320
I'm going to eat a lot.

326
00:17:52,320 --> 00:17:54,320
It's delicious.

327
00:17:54,320 --> 00:17:56,320
Is this your first time eating chanja?

328
00:17:56,320 --> 00:17:58,320
It's my first time eating chanja.

329
00:17:58,320 --> 00:18:00,320
What is this?

330
00:18:00,320 --> 00:18:02,320
This is a long-leaved potato.

331
00:18:02,320 --> 00:18:06,320
This is delicious.

332
00:18:06,320 --> 00:18:08,320
This is delicious.

333
00:18:08,320 --> 00:18:12,320
I want it to be summer soon.

334
00:18:12,320 --> 00:18:16,320
Everyone is eating in the summer.

335
00:18:16,320 --> 00:18:22,320
I want to drink tea in the terrace.

336
00:18:22,320 --> 00:18:24,320
It's not fashionable.

337
00:18:24,320 --> 00:18:28,320
It's fashionable and mature.

338
00:18:28,320 --> 00:18:32,320
I have the image of an older sister.

339
00:18:32,320 --> 00:18:34,320
Let's do it next year.

340
00:18:34,320 --> 00:18:36,320
Let's do it next year.

341
00:18:36,320 --> 00:18:40,320
I'm interested in hot wine in winter.

342
00:18:40,320 --> 00:18:44,320
It's fashionable.

343
00:18:44,320 --> 00:18:46,320
Hot wine.

344
00:18:46,320 --> 00:18:50,320
I haven't drunk wine yet.

345
00:18:50,320 --> 00:18:54,320
I don't know the type of wine.

346
00:18:54,320 --> 00:18:58,320
I got wine from MAYA.

347
00:18:58,320 --> 00:19:00,320
Champagne?

348
00:19:00,320 --> 00:19:06,320
I often drink alcohol on my 20th
birthday.

349
00:19:06,320 --> 00:19:10,320
I drank a lot of alcohol.

350
00:19:10,320 --> 00:19:14,320
I haven't drunk alcohol yet.

351
00:19:14,320 --> 00:19:18,320
I drink a lot of Japanese sake.

352
00:19:18,320 --> 00:19:22,320
Champagne is fashionable.

353
00:19:22,320 --> 00:19:24,320
I didn't drink champagne.

354
00:19:24,320 --> 00:19:26,320
Everyone drank Japanese sake.

355
00:19:26,320 --> 00:19:30,320
I'm happy.

356
00:19:30,320 --> 00:19:32,320
Let's drink at home again.

357
00:19:32,320 --> 00:19:34,320
Let's do it.

358
00:19:34,320 --> 00:19:38,320
It's delicious.

359
00:19:38,320 --> 00:19:40,320
Thank you.

360
00:19:40,320 --> 00:19:42,320
It looks delicious.

361
00:19:42,320 --> 00:19:48,320
It's hard to find fried potatoes.

362
00:19:48,320 --> 00:19:52,320
There is no fried potatoes.

363
00:19:52,320 --> 00:19:54,320
I like long potatoes.

364
00:19:58,320 --> 00:20:00,320
It's delicious.

365
00:20:00,320 --> 00:20:02,320
Let's eat.

366
00:20:02,320 --> 00:20:04,320
It's delicious.

367
00:20:04,320 --> 00:20:06,320
It's crispy.

368
00:20:06,320 --> 00:20:08,320
Is it a kimchi?

369
00:20:08,320 --> 00:20:10,320
It's crispy.

370
00:20:10,320 --> 00:20:12,320
It's a long potato.

371
00:20:12,320 --> 00:20:14,320
It's a long potato.

372
00:20:18,320 --> 00:20:20,320
It's delicious.

373
00:20:20,320 --> 00:20:24,320
I learned that you shouldn't drink sake
with a skipper.

374
00:20:24,320 --> 00:20:28,320
I learned that.

375
00:20:28,320 --> 00:20:38,320
I learned that the way to drink is
different depending on the condition of
the day.

376
00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:42,320
My family likes to drink.

377
00:20:42,320 --> 00:20:46,320
I learned that you should eat a lot of
food before drinking.

378
00:20:46,320 --> 00:20:50,320
That was the best lesson.

379
00:20:50,320 --> 00:20:54,320
We drank at home together.

380
00:20:54,320 --> 00:21:00,320
The lineup of food was fried chicken and
takoyaki.

381
00:21:00,320 --> 00:21:02,320
And gyoza.

382
00:21:02,320 --> 00:21:04,320
I didn't bake gyoza.

383
00:21:04,320 --> 00:21:08,320
I ate three kinds of gyoza.

384
00:21:08,320 --> 00:21:10,320
I ate too much.

385
00:21:10,320 --> 00:21:12,320
I was full.

386
00:21:12,320 --> 00:21:16,320
I ate something refreshing.

387
00:21:16,320 --> 00:21:18,320
I ate a lot of fried food.

388
00:21:18,320 --> 00:21:20,320
Why do you eat?

389
00:21:20,320 --> 00:21:22,320
It's important.

390
00:21:22,320 --> 00:21:24,320
I'm happy.

391
00:21:26,320 --> 00:21:28,320
I feel sorry for other members.

392
00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:34,320
I'm looking forward to drinking with
RICO.

393
00:21:34,320 --> 00:21:36,320
We all said we wanted to eat together.

394
00:21:36,320 --> 00:21:40,320
But we didn't have a schedule.

395
00:21:40,320 --> 00:21:44,320
I haven't had a drink with everyone.

396
00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:46,320
This is the second time.

397
00:21:46,320 --> 00:21:50,320
I'm sorry for other members.

398
00:21:50,320 --> 00:21:58,320
I'm sorry. I'm worried about makgeolli.

399
00:21:58,320 --> 00:22:02,320
I want to eat Korean food.

400
00:22:02,320 --> 00:22:04,320
I'm worried about makgeolli.

401
00:22:04,320 --> 00:22:08,320
Is it similar to amazake?

402
00:22:08,320 --> 00:22:12,320
I've never had this before.

403
00:22:12,320 --> 00:22:16,320
Thank you.

404
00:22:16,320 --> 00:22:18,320
Thank you.

405
00:22:18,320 --> 00:22:20,320
What is this?

406
00:22:20,320 --> 00:22:22,320
This is salmon.

407
00:22:22,320 --> 00:22:24,320
I know the color of salmon.

408
00:22:24,320 --> 00:22:26,320
I think it's salmon.

409
00:22:26,320 --> 00:22:28,320
I'll mix it.

410
00:22:28,320 --> 00:22:30,320
Yes.

411
00:22:30,320 --> 00:22:32,320
Please.

412
00:22:34,320 --> 00:22:36,320
Mix it.

413
00:22:36,320 --> 00:22:38,320
Mix it.

414
00:22:38,320 --> 00:22:40,320
Cute.

415
00:22:40,320 --> 00:22:42,320
Cute.

416
00:22:42,320 --> 00:22:44,320
It's amazing to have seaweeds in this
color.

417
00:22:44,320 --> 00:22:46,320
I mixed it.

418
00:22:46,320 --> 00:22:48,320
I think it's about this.

419
00:22:48,320 --> 00:22:50,320
Yes.

420
00:22:50,320 --> 00:22:52,320
Yes.

421
00:22:52,320 --> 00:22:54,320
Yes.

422
00:22:54,320 --> 00:22:56,320
It's delicious.

423
00:22:56,320 --> 00:22:58,320
It's delicious.

424
00:22:58,320 --> 00:23:02,320
I thought it would go well with soy
milk.

425
00:23:02,320 --> 00:23:04,320
It's delicious.

426
00:23:04,320 --> 00:23:06,320
It's delicious.

427
00:23:06,320 --> 00:23:08,320
It's delicious.

428
00:23:08,320 --> 00:23:10,320
It's delicious.

429
00:23:10,320 --> 00:23:12,320
It's sweet.

430
00:23:12,320 --> 00:23:14,320
It's sweet.

431
00:23:14,320 --> 00:23:16,320
It's delicious.

432
00:23:16,320 --> 00:23:18,320
It's delicious.

433
00:23:18,320 --> 00:23:20,320
It's delicious.

434
00:23:20,320 --> 00:23:22,320
RIKO, present.

435
00:23:22,320 --> 00:23:24,320
Thank you.

436
00:23:24,320 --> 00:23:26,320
Shoes.

437
00:23:26,320 --> 00:23:28,320
Shoes.

438
00:23:28,320 --> 00:23:30,320
What is it?

439
00:23:30,320 --> 00:23:32,320
Are you ready?

440
00:23:32,320 --> 00:23:34,320
I'm ready.

441
00:23:34,320 --> 00:23:36,320
I ordered mochi.

442
00:23:36,320 --> 00:23:38,320
Both of you are forced to eat.

443
00:23:38,320 --> 00:23:40,320
I can eat this.

444
00:23:40,320 --> 00:23:42,320
I'm sorry.

445
00:23:42,320 --> 00:23:44,320
I'm sorry.

446
00:23:46,320 --> 00:23:48,320
I'll eat this.

447
00:23:48,320 --> 00:23:50,320
Good job.

448
00:23:50,320 --> 00:23:52,320
Good job.

449
00:23:52,320 --> 00:23:54,320
RIKO, congratulations.

450
00:23:54,320 --> 00:23:56,320
Thank you.

451
00:23:56,320 --> 00:23:58,320
I drink with you first.

452
00:23:58,320 --> 00:24:00,320
Yes.

453
00:24:00,320 --> 00:24:02,320
I drink with the members.

454
00:24:02,320 --> 00:24:04,320
I drink with everyone.

455
00:24:04,320 --> 00:24:06,320
Yes.

456
00:24:06,320 --> 00:24:08,320
I drink with all the members.

457
00:24:08,320 --> 00:24:12,320
I drink with everyone.
