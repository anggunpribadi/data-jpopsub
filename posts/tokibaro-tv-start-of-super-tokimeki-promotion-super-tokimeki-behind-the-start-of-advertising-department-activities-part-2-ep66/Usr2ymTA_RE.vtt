worst day

 Good job!

01:23.938 --> 01:27.838
 Tomorrow will surely be a better day

01:27.838 --> 01:29.738
 I'm sleepy

01:30.938 --> 01:32.038
 My bangs...

01:32.038 --> 01:33.038
 Ah!

01:34.038 --> 01:36.038
 I'm Hitoka!

01:36.038 --> 01:37.038
 Hello!

01:37.038 --> 01:41.038
 Today, I'm taking pictures.

01:43.640 --> 01:47.640
 Cute ribbon, right?

01:47.640 --> 01:50.640
 There's a ribbon here, too.

01:50.640 --> 01:51.640
 There's a ribbon on the waist, too.

01:51.640 --> 01:53.640
 Heart is cute, too.

01:53.640 --> 01:55.640
 Right?

01:55.640 --> 01:57.640
 Right?

01:57.640 --> 02:02.640
 Yes, yes.

02:03.418 --> 02:05.418
 I'm shooting now.

02:06.418 --> 02:08.418
 Kanamin is laughing.

02:10.418 --> 02:16.418
 I ate croissant this morning.

02:17.418 --> 02:22.418
 I made gratin last night and ate with
my family.

02:23.418 --> 02:27.418
 I made apple candy, but I failed.

02:27.418 --> 02:32.418
 I made it at first try.

02:34.040 --> 02:38.040
 I've been cooking myself recently.

02:39.040 --> 02:42.040
 I like corn soup and pumpkin soup.

02:43.040 --> 02:45.040
 I make it for my sister.

02:51.040 --> 02:54.040
 Today's lipstick is pink.

02:54.040 --> 02:56.040
 Pink.

02:56.040 --> 03:00.040
 I'm going to put on eye shadow.

03:02.136 --> 03:03.136
 It's cute.

03:05.136 --> 03:06.136
 Well, then.

03:07.136 --> 03:08.136
 Bye.

03:08.136 --> 03:09.136
 Bye-bye.

03:13.136 --> 03:14.136
 What?

03:16.136 --> 03:17.136
 I found it.

03:19.136 --> 03:21.136
 You are beautiful today, too.

03:22.136 --> 03:24.136
 You are cute, so I'm going to upload
it.

03:24.136 --> 03:25.136
 Upload.

03:25.136 --> 03:26.136
 I'm going to upload it.

03:26.136 --> 03:29.136
 Because you are cute.

03:30.522 --> 03:32.522
 Ah, so cute!

03:32.522 --> 03:33.522
 Ah!

03:33.522 --> 03:34.022
 Ah!

03:34.022 --> 03:35.522
 The eyes!

03:35.522 --> 03:36.522
 The eyes!

03:36.522 --> 03:37.522
 The eyes!

03:37.522 --> 03:40.522
 Thank you so much!

03:40.522 --> 03:43.522
 Did you see that service shot?

03:43.522 --> 03:46.522
 It's wonderful!

03:46.522 --> 03:48.522
 It's a wink!

03:48.522 --> 03:50.522
 So cute!

03:50.522 --> 03:56.192

03:57.192 --> 04:03.192
 Today, I was not live streaming, but I
was taking a picture of myself.

04:04.192 --> 04:06.192
 Why did I say live streaming?

04:07.192 --> 04:08.192
 I don't know.

04:09.192 --> 04:14.192
 It was my first live streaming since I
became a super fan.

04:15.192 --> 04:23.192
 I wore this costume and had fun with
everyone.

04:23.192 --> 04:33.192
 I think I was able to show a new side
of me this time.

04:33.192 --> 04:40.192
 Please check my live streaming after
becoming a super fan!

04:44.000 --> 04:49.000
 I think I can show you a different
feeling from usual.

04:49.000 --> 04:52.000
 And the main costume is very cute.

04:52.000 --> 04:56.000
 I'm sure I can get a live photo that I
want you to get.

04:56.000 --> 04:59.000
 Please look forward to it.

05:04.000 --> 05:05.000
 Thank you.

05:05.000 --> 05:08.000
 Thank you.

05:08.800 --> 05:10.800
 See you again!

05:10.800 --> 05:18.800
 I'm sure you'll be excited when the new
live photo comes out.

05:18.800 --> 05:26.800
 Please aim for the complete version and
get the live photo!

05:26.800 --> 05:28.800
 Bye bye!

05:28.800 --> 05:34.800
 The live photo shooting is over!

05:38.490 --> 05:40.490
 It was fun to be able to do it all in
one day.

05:40.490 --> 05:41.490
 It was fun.

05:41.490 --> 05:43.490
 We had an event on our own.

05:43.490 --> 05:44.490
 It was a little different from usual.

05:44.490 --> 05:48.490
 It was fun to do it all by ourselves.

05:48.490 --> 05:49.490
 It was fun.

05:49.490 --> 05:52.490
 It was a very exciting game, and we
were able to do it all by ourselves.

05:52.490 --> 05:54.490
 It was very powerful.

05:54.490 --> 05:56.490
 It was a lot of fun.

05:56.490 --> 05:58.490
 Everyone, please check it out.

05:58.490 --> 06:00.490
 Please check it out.

06:00.490 --> 06:01.490
 Thank you.

06:01.490 --> 06:04.608
 Thank you.

06:04.608 --> 06:13.608
 I'm so excited!

06:15.608 --> 06:19.608
 I'm so excited!

06:19.608 --> 06:22.608
 I'm number 29!

06:22.608 --> 06:26.160
 I'm number 30!

06:27.160 --> 06:29.160
 I'm number 10!

06:31.160 --> 06:32.160
 Ta-da!

06:33.160 --> 06:36.160
 I'm number 13, Kanami!

06:37.160 --> 06:40.160
 Look! I'm number 14!

06:42.160 --> 06:46.160
 I'm number 46, Ayami!

06:46.160 --> 06:49.160
 I'm number 17, Ayami!

06:49.160 --> 06:52.160
 What did you get, Pio?

06:53.688 --> 06:55.148
 What does Hiyori mean by

06:55.148 --> 06:56.728
 Number 43

06:57.708 --> 06:58.868
 Correct!

06:58.868 --> 07:00.868
 Hit it!

07:07.290 --> 07:09.290
 Hit me!

07:11.290 --> 07:13.290
 Hit me!

07:15.290 --> 07:17.290
 Hit me!

07:17.290 --> 07:22.586
 Translated by Vortex

07:22.586 --> 07:24.586
 It's so cute!

07:25.586 --> 07:28.586
 But it's not number 43.

07:30.586 --> 07:32.586
 Oh, Hiyori-chan!

07:33.586 --> 07:34.586
 Is this it?

07:36.586 --> 07:37.586
 Oh!

07:37.586 --> 07:38.586
 That's it!

07:38.586 --> 07:40.586
 It's number 43!

07:43.400 --> 07:45.400
 Hey, give me the pen!

07:47.400 --> 07:49.400
 I don't have it!

07:51.400 --> 07:53.400
 Which one will you get?

07:53.400 --> 07:54.400
 Tokimeki Live Photos!

07:54.400 --> 07:57.400
 Number 43!

07:57.400 --> 08:03.400
 Tokimeki Live Photos will have a
limited time offer of a selfie version!

08:16.410 --> 08:21.410
 I got number 26!

08:25.410 --> 08:27.410
 Oh, it was number 29.

08:27.410 --> 08:29.410
 Is this it?

08:29.410 --> 08:33.410
 Oh, that's number 43!

08:33.410 --> 08:41.952
 Hey, give me a break!

08:41.952 --> 08:47.312
 I'm in the middle of a break, but I
have a good news.

08:48.792 --> 08:53.232
 Good evening, everyone! I'm Kanamin,
a.k.a. Tsujino Kanami.

08:53.232 --> 08:59.512
 Today, I have a good news!

08:59.512 --> 09:01.312
 Yeah!

09:01.312 --> 09:09.200
 It's a couple song from Tomorrow's
Strongest Group, here!

09:09.200 --> 09:12.140
 I'd like to announce the names of the
songs!

09:15.400 --> 09:21.400
 I'm so happy to announce the names of
the songs!

09:21.400 --> 09:28.400
 I hope you can guess the names of the
songs by the title of the song!

09:28.400 --> 09:36.400
 The new single, Tomorrow Saikyousetsu,
is a very positive song.

09:36.400 --> 09:43.400
 It's a song that makes you feel
positive.

09:43.400 --> 09:48.400
 The coupling song is also the best!

09:48.400 --> 09:53.400
 I'd like to announce the names of the
songs!

09:54.016 --> 10:04.016
 First, the song that is included in the
Type A version and the Type B version
is...

10:04.016 --> 10:06.016
 Oh!

10:06.016 --> 10:11.002
 恋のジャッカル

10:11.002 --> 10:16.002
 I think this song is a little bit like,

10:16.002 --> 10:19.002
 when you hear the word, jackal, you
might think,

10:19.002 --> 10:22.002
 what? What? What?

10:22.002 --> 10:28.002
 You might think of something like that.

10:28.002 --> 10:31.002
 How is it? Is it right?

10:31.002 --> 10:34.002
 Please look forward to the song.

10:34.002 --> 10:43.002
 Next is our pick for Type C!

10:45.104 --> 10:50.904
 It's one of my favorite songs and it's
really good!

10:50.904 --> 10:53.904
 I can't wait for you to hear it!

10:53.904 --> 10:57.604
 There's one more thing I like about
this song.

10:57.604 --> 11:06.604
 I love the jacket I'm wearing in the
cover of the song.

11:06.604 --> 11:08.604
 Let's go!

11:08.604 --> 11:10.604
 Last!

11:11.136 --> 11:15.136
 Type D No.1!

11:15.136 --> 11:20.136
 The one who is included in this is...

11:21.136 --> 11:22.136
 Ta-da!

11:22.136 --> 11:25.136
 I'm the No.1 girl!

11:27.136 --> 11:29.136
 It's a really cool song.

11:29.136 --> 11:36.136
 The last chorus is really cool.

11:36.136 --> 11:42.136
 Everything is cool, but I like the last
part the most.

11:43.136 --> 11:50.136
 I think you'll be able to relate to it
if you listen to it.

11:50.136 --> 11:56.136
 The choreography is really fun to dance
to.

11:56.136 --> 12:03.136
 I think you'll enjoy it, so please look
forward to it.

12:03.136 --> 12:09.136
 I can't wait to play all the songs!

12:09.136 --> 12:10.136
 I can't wait!

12:10.136 --> 12:13.136
 Please look forward to it!

12:13.136 --> 12:18.136
 Please continue to enjoy Tokiwara!

12:18.136 --> 12:20.136
 See you!

12:20.136 --> 12:24.136
 This was Hanamin! Bye bye!

12:26.778 --> 12:32.778
 We are shooting at Toshimaen today!

12:34.778 --> 12:40.778
 We had a chance to perform at the Music
Video of FASHION HEART SHAKER and also
at the live show.

12:41.778 --> 12:43.778
 I'm so happy!

12:44.778 --> 12:47.778
 We are going to ride the merry-go-
round!

12:48.778 --> 12:50.778
 We are going to ride the merry-go-
round!

12:51.778 --> 12:54.778
 We are going to ride the merry-go-
round!

12:54.778 --> 12:55.778
 Start!

13:02.682 --> 13:03.722
 Not this one!

13:03.722 --> 13:05.722
 I'm scared!

13:05.722 --> 13:07.722
 I'm scared!

 Please subscribe to my channel!

13:29.754 --> 13:31.754
 It's spinning.

13:55.130 --> 13:59.130
 We're going to eat croquettes now.

13:59.130 --> 14:00.130
 Croquettes?

14:00.130 --> 14:01.130
 It's gross.

14:05.130 --> 14:07.130
 It's like a cookie.

14:07.130 --> 14:08.130
 It's a cookie.

14:08.130 --> 14:09.130
 Croquettes.

14:09.130 --> 14:11.130
 It's like a croquette.

14:11.130 --> 14:12.130
 Croquettes.

14:12.130 --> 14:14.130
 We're going to eat.

 Bye bye.

15:32.538 --> 15:34.538
 I'm going to the beach.

15:36.538 --> 15:38.538
 It's a cover.

15:38.538 --> 15:39.538
 It's so small.

15:39.538 --> 15:40.538
 I want to go inside.

15:40.538 --> 15:48.442

16:13.058 --> 16:15.058
 It's getting white.

16:17.058 --> 16:19.058
 I don't know where to look.

16:22.058 --> 16:24.058
 Wait, it's looking like Jenny.
