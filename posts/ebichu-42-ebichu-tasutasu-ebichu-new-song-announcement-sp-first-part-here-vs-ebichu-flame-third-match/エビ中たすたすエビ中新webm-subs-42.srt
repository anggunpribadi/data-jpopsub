00:02:24,960 --> 00:02:27,960
Aikido-san sent me a demo.

20
00:02:28,960 --> 00:02:33,960
A demo version of Haruyasumi Moratorium
was sent to the members.

21
00:02:34,960 --> 00:02:36,960
Let's listen to it.

22
00:02:37,960 --> 00:02:39,960
It's so cute!

23
00:02:40,960 --> 00:02:42,960
The lyrics are cute.

24
00:02:42,960 --> 00:02:45,960
Here are the cute lyrics of the member.

25
00:02:46,960 --> 00:02:52,960
Haruyasumi Moratorium middle school
students performed a youth song before
the new semester.

26
00:02:52,960 --> 00:02:54,448
This feeling...

27
00:02:54,448 --> 00:02:58,008
It's like a set number. It's never going
to be divided.

28
00:02:58,008 --> 00:03:02,648
The feelings of a girl are told by the
words of a middle school student.

29
00:03:02,648 --> 00:03:05,248
A 100 times frustrating emotions.

30
00:03:05,248 --> 00:03:07,928
I'm so into you that I'm so sad.

31
00:03:07,928 --> 00:03:12,088
The feelings of one-sided love that
move.

32
00:03:12,088 --> 00:03:17,208
I'm looking forward to it. I'm looking
forward to the recording.

33
00:03:17,208 --> 00:03:20,728
After 10 days, the recording of the
Ebichu members was started.

34
00:03:20,728 --> 00:03:24,186
The recording of the band was started.

35
00:03:24,186 --> 00:03:27,186
The studio has a big figure.

36
00:03:27,186 --> 00:03:34,186
The guitar sound is not like the
previous Ebichu songs.

37
00:03:34,186 --> 00:03:36,186
It's more rock.

38
00:03:36,186 --> 00:03:41,186
I'm particular about making rock rock
sound stronger.

39
00:03:42,186 --> 00:03:45,186
Rock sound that is not in the previous
Ebichu songs.

40
00:03:45,186 --> 00:03:49,186
To make that, the members of HEAR are
gathered in the studio.

41
00:03:49,186 --> 00:03:50,186
Furthermore...

42
00:03:50,186 --> 00:03:54,032
Special keyboardist, Hajimetaru.

43
00:03:54,032 --> 00:03:58,032
Hajimetaru, who played in rock band
Midori.

44
00:03:58,032 --> 00:04:01,032
He is currently active as a solo artist.

45
00:04:01,032 --> 00:04:06,032
O-Gata has recruited a strong musician
for this song.

46
00:04:06,032 --> 00:04:10,032
I'm the bassist, Keita Nishi.

47
00:04:10,032 --> 00:04:12,032
Keita Nishi.

48
00:04:12,032 --> 00:04:17,032
He is a talented bassist who has been in
the back band of Koteto Moyasu.

49
00:04:17,032 --> 00:04:21,904
Actually, he is also in charge of the
arrangement of this song.

50
00:04:21,904 --> 00:04:24,904
Let's hear about his impression of the
song.

51
00:04:24,904 --> 00:04:30,904
When I heard the song in the story, I
thought it was a really good song.

52
00:04:30,904 --> 00:04:34,904
There are many melodies that only Kaeki
has.

53
00:04:34,904 --> 00:04:41,904
It's a wide range of the song that is
close to the color of Ebichu.

54
00:04:41,904 --> 00:04:43,904
You are a good praise.

55
00:04:43,904 --> 00:04:45,904
This is a strange praise.

56
00:04:45,904 --> 00:04:46,904
Are you okay?

57
00:04:46,904 --> 00:04:48,904
I'm praising you, but are you okay?

58
00:04:48,904 --> 00:04:49,280
I'm sorry.

59
00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:55,280
In the spring break, a strong rock
musician was gathered for the recording
of Latrium Junior High School.

60
00:04:55,280 --> 00:05:23,280
And finally...

61
00:05:26,650 --> 00:05:32,650
Mr. Ishizaki, the producer of Ebichu's
song, heard this.

62
00:05:32,650 --> 00:05:35,650
It's really cool.

63
00:05:38,650 --> 00:05:44,650
Cute lyrics and a strong rock sound.
What kind of song will it be?

64
00:05:47,650 --> 00:05:49,650
Thank you.

65
00:05:49,650 --> 00:05:54,672
Ebichu members' recording begins.

66
00:05:54,672 --> 00:05:58,672
Ayaka Yasumoto is the top batter.

67
00:06:00,672 --> 00:06:01,672
Let's start with the chorus.

68
00:06:01,672 --> 00:06:05,672
Let's start with the most exciting part.

69
00:06:05,672 --> 00:06:09,672
Each member is finally recording the
vocals.

70
00:06:09,672 --> 00:06:22,672
The ciudpan Panро.

71
00:06:23,674 --> 00:06:32,674
I'm sorry but I'm not in a situation to
be in a situation to be in

72
00:06:32,674 --> 00:06:33,674
That was good

73
00:06:33,674 --> 00:06:35,674
Thank you

74
00:06:35,674 --> 00:06:39,674
I'm not in a situation to be in

75
00:06:39,674 --> 00:06:42,674
I'm going from high to low

76
00:06:42,674 --> 00:06:47,674
The pitch is low but the feeling is high

77
00:06:47,674 --> 00:06:53,674
You can sing like you are right now so
you can put your feelings into it

78
00:06:53,674 --> 00:06:56,432
Please do it

79
00:06:56,432 --> 00:06:58,292
You can put your feelings into it

80
00:06:58,292 --> 00:07:01,292
How will Yasumoto respond?

81
00:07:14,778 --> 00:07:16,778
Tu ga share quand Mush51

82
00:07:16,778 --> 00:07:18,778
Perfect!

83
00:07:20,304 --> 00:07:22,304
After the recording was over

84
00:07:22,304 --> 00:07:24,304
It was very fun

85
00:07:24,304 --> 00:07:28,304
I'm always nervous during the recording

86
00:07:28,304 --> 00:07:32,304
It's like a stick

87
00:07:32,304 --> 00:07:35,304
I was able to do it comfortably

88
00:07:35,304 --> 00:07:41,304
Next, the one who appeared in the flashy
clothes is Aika Hirota

89
00:07:43,304 --> 00:07:45,304
I came to Hayaki-san

90
00:07:45,304 --> 00:07:48,304
Hayaki-san was wearing black and white
clothes

91
00:07:48,304 --> 00:07:50,304
I'm not wearing anything

92
00:07:50,304 --> 00:07:52,304
Hirota is full of spirit

93
00:07:52,304 --> 00:07:56,192
What kind of singing voice will he let
us hear?

94
00:07:56,192 --> 00:08:02,010
Thank you for watching!

95
00:08:02,010 --> 00:08:11,010
Moratorium Moratorium Moratorium Junior
High Schooler

00:08:11,010 --> 00:08:17,472
Moratorium Moratorium Junior High

97
00:08:17,472 --> 00:08:19,472
It's pretty good.

98
00:08:19,472 --> 00:08:20,472
Thank you.

99
00:08:20,472 --> 00:08:22,472
It's suddenly good.

100
00:08:22,472 --> 00:08:23,472
Thank you.

101
00:08:23,472 --> 00:08:27,472
Ai, Ai, can you do it with a rock-like
feeling?

102
00:08:27,472 --> 00:08:30,472
It's more rock-like here.

103
00:08:30,472 --> 00:08:32,472
Please try it.

104
00:08:32,472 --> 00:08:50,426
How will Hirota respond to this request?

105
00:08:57,594 --> 00:08:59,594
It's really good

106
00:08:59,594 --> 00:09:01,594
Thank you

107
00:09:01,594 --> 00:09:06,594
Hirota returns the desired rock feeling
with a wonderful song

108
00:09:06,594 --> 00:09:08,594
Expectations are high for the finish

109
00:09:08,594 --> 00:09:13,594
I was able to sing like a live

110
00:09:13,594 --> 00:09:18,594
I'm looking forward to how it will
change from now on

111
00:09:19,594 --> 00:09:22,594
Following Hirota, he entered the studio

112
00:09:22,594 --> 00:09:27,594
I'm going to go to the studio

113
00:09:27,594 --> 00:09:29,594
I'm not the usual me

114
00:09:29,594 --> 00:09:34,594
Really? But I heard that it was fun from
Ayaka

115
00:09:34,594 --> 00:09:36,594
I heard it was hard

116
00:09:36,594 --> 00:09:39,594
It was fun at all

117
00:09:39,594 --> 00:09:39,888
Thank you for your viewing

118
00:09:39,888 --> 00:09:44,248
The recording of the lyrics that made me
look forward to this day starts

119
00:10:09,888 --> 00:10:10,042
Thank you for your viewing

120
00:10:10,042 --> 00:10:15,042
Moratorium, moratorium, moratorium, it's
different

121
00:10:16,042 --> 00:10:18,042
Here, the O-Gata is the direction

122
00:10:19,042 --> 00:10:22,042
I'll try it, the emotion is 1.2 times

123
00:10:23,042 --> 00:10:26,042
It's already quite high, so I won't say
it's 2 times

124
00:10:27,042 --> 00:10:29,042
1.2 times, 1.2 times

125
00:10:29,042 --> 00:10:37,786
1.2 times, please do it again

126
00:10:37,786 --> 00:10:47,786
Moratorium, Moratorium, Moratorium,

Perfect

128
00:10:50,786 --> 00:10:54,786
The 1.2 times better version of the
emotion is also completed

129
00:10:54,786 --> 00:10:57,786
Thank you for the wonderful song

130
00:10:57,786 --> 00:10:59,786
Thank you

131
00:10:59,786 --> 00:11:01,786
Thank you too

132
00:11:01,786 --> 00:11:06,786
Ishii who was watching the recording so
far

133
00:11:06,786 --> 00:11:08,786
The finish is very fun

134
00:11:08,786 --> 00:11:10,786
I think it's a very good recording

135
00:11:10,786 --> 00:11:13,786
Kaiki-san is a singer

136
00:11:13,786 --> 00:11:18,786
I think I understand the feelings of the
person who sings

137
00:11:18,786 --> 00:11:20,786
And

138
00:11:20,786 --> 00:11:22,786
Thank you for your cooperation

139
00:11:22,786 --> 00:11:27,786
Unlike usual, for some reason, Kobayashi
with a frowning expression

140
00:11:27,786 --> 00:11:28,784
Thank you for watching

141
00:11:28,784 --> 00:11:31,784
Actually before recording

142
00:11:31,784 --> 00:11:34,784
Is there anything you are worried about?

143
00:11:34,784 --> 00:11:37,784
I'm worried about everything

144
00:11:37,784 --> 00:11:41,784
She wishes for recording while having
anxiety

145
00:11:41,784 --> 00:11:43,784
Is it okay?

146
00:11:43,784 --> 00:12:04,698
Let's go

147
00:12:04,698 --> 00:12:06,698
Perfect!

148
00:12:06,698 --> 00:12:08,698
Today is really good

149
00:12:08,698 --> 00:12:10,698
Really good

150
00:12:10,698 --> 00:12:13,698
I've been listening to your voice for 2
years

151
00:12:13,698 --> 00:12:15,698
It's really good

152
00:12:15,698 --> 00:12:18,698
Please do as you want

153
00:12:18,698 --> 00:12:23,698
In addition to Kobayashi's worries, the
singing voice of this day is excellent

154
00:12:23,698 --> 00:12:35,698
Seimei-gi-au Seimei-gi-au Seimei-gi-au
Seimei-gi-au

155
00:12:35,698 --> 00:12:38,698
It's really good

156
00:12:38,698 --> 00:12:44,698
Kobayashi, who was in a good mood,
completed the recording by repeating OK
take

157
00:12:44,698 --> 00:12:46,698
And

158
00:12:46,698 --> 00:12:50,698
Mayama-san, please

159
00:12:50,698 --> 00:12:53,698
Can you do it?

160
00:12:53,698 --> 00:12:55,698
Can you do it?

161
00:12:55,698 --> 00:12:58,698
For some reason, Mayama can't stop
laughing

162
00:12:58,698 --> 00:13:01,698
She has an important role

163
00:13:01,698 --> 00:13:05,698
I will go from the top to the line

164
00:13:05,698 --> 00:13:07,698
Mayama is in charge of this part

165
00:13:07,698 --> 00:13:10,698
This song's title call

166
00:13:10,698 --> 00:13:12,698
Please

167
00:13:12,698 --> 00:13:16,698
Seimei-gi-au Seimei-gi-au Seimei-gi-au

168
00:13:16,698 --> 00:13:19,698
My heart is

Haruyasumi Moratorium middle school
student

170
00:13:21,698 --> 00:13:27,698
In addition, during the title call, you
mixed more breath

171
00:13:27,698 --> 00:13:29,698
I understand

172
00:13:29,698 --> 00:13:32,698
Seimei-gi-au

173
00:13:32,698 --> 00:13:35,698
Haruyasumi Moratorium middle school
student

174
00:13:35,698 --> 00:13:37,698
You're doing Moratorium

175
00:13:37,698 --> 00:13:40,698
I'm doing Moratorium

176
00:13:40,698 --> 00:13:42,698
OK, I got it

177
00:13:42,698 --> 00:13:44,698
Thank you

178
00:13:44,698 --> 00:13:48,698
Mayama's title call, which was done with
Moratorium, is also completed

179
00:13:48,698 --> 00:13:51,698
The song's structure is gradually
completed

180
00:13:51,698 --> 00:13:54,698
Beyond the toss

181
00:13:54,698 --> 00:13:57,698
Riko-chan

182
00:13:57,698 --> 00:13:59,698
Good morning

183
00:13:59,698 --> 00:14:01,698
Thank you

184
00:14:01,698 --> 00:14:03,698
Let's go

185
00:14:03,698 --> 00:14:06,698
Interesting

186
00:14:06,698 --> 00:14:08,698
Please

187
00:14:08,698 --> 00:14:22,698
Thank you

188
00:14:22,992 --> 00:14:24,992
I'm still in love with you

189
00:14:24,992 --> 00:14:26,992
I'm still in love with you

190
00:14:26,992 --> 00:14:28,992
I'm still in love with you

191
00:14:28,992 --> 00:14:30,992
It's good, Nakayama-san

192
00:14:30,992 --> 00:14:32,992
It's perfect

193
00:14:34,992 --> 00:14:36,992
I'll do my best

194
00:14:36,992 --> 00:14:38,992
I'll do my best

195
00:14:38,992 --> 00:14:42,992
Like Mayama, the lines are also in
Nakayama's part

196
00:14:42,992 --> 00:14:44,992
Then

197
00:14:44,992 --> 00:14:46,992
A-melody

198
00:14:46,992 --> 00:14:48,992
Bye-bye

199
00:14:48,992 --> 00:14:56,992
Thank you for watching

200
00:14:57,562 --> 00:15:02,562
This is also a bright bye-bye.

201
00:15:02,562 --> 00:15:03,562
Yes.

202
00:15:03,562 --> 00:15:04,562
Please.

203
00:15:04,562 --> 00:15:05,562
Yes.

204
00:15:05,562 --> 00:15:16,314
Bye bye.

205
00:15:16,314 --> 00:15:18,314
Thank you very much

206
00:15:18,314 --> 00:15:22,314
Even in the recording, Nakayama World is
fully open

207
00:15:22,314 --> 00:15:25,314
Ogata finished the 6 members

208
00:15:25,314 --> 00:15:27,314
It's wonderful

209
00:15:27,314 --> 00:15:29,314
I'm leaving a good take

210
00:15:29,314 --> 00:15:31,314
I'm going well

211
00:15:31,314 --> 00:15:33,314
I'm really happy

212
00:15:33,314 --> 00:15:38,314
After this, the emergency situation
occurred in Matsuno's recording

213
00:15:38,314 --> 00:15:44,384
And finally, the new full version will
be released

214
00:15:44,384 --> 00:15:46,384
Here we are

215
00:15:46,384 --> 00:15:50,384
Thank you for your cooperation

216
00:15:50,384 --> 00:15:52,384
There are two more to go

217
00:15:52,384 --> 00:16:14,384
Hoshina's recording starts

218
00:16:15,130 --> 00:16:17,130
Perfectly

219
00:16:17,130 --> 00:16:19,130
Super perfectly

220
00:16:19,130 --> 00:16:21,130
Then, such a request

221
00:16:21,130 --> 00:16:23,130
Something like a burikko

222
00:16:23,130 --> 00:16:27,130
While remembering Taki Ue-san

223
00:16:27,130 --> 00:16:31,130
Can you think of that buri Ue-san?

224
00:16:31,130 --> 00:16:32,130
Yes

225
00:16:32,130 --> 00:16:34,130
To the request of burikko-like

226
00:16:34,130 --> 00:16:45,114
I will do my best

227
00:16:45,114 --> 00:16:47,114
It's OK

228
00:16:47,114 --> 00:16:50,114
The rust is very cool

229
00:16:50,114 --> 00:16:53,114
You know that you needed the power of
Buriuue, right?

230
00:16:53,114 --> 00:16:55,114
I thought so

231
00:16:55,114 --> 00:16:58,114
I thought the contrast was very good

232
00:16:58,114 --> 00:17:00,114
And the last

233
00:17:00,114 --> 00:17:03,114
Thank you, Chief Matsuno

234
00:17:03,114 --> 00:17:05,114
Chief? Please

235
00:17:05,114 --> 00:17:09,114
Please decide the last

236
00:17:09,114 --> 00:17:10,114
I will do my best

237
00:17:10,114 --> 00:17:14,816
Matsuno will be the last

238
00:17:14,816 --> 00:17:17,816
I'll start with the B-melody

239
00:17:17,816 --> 00:17:32,282
B-melody

240
00:17:32,282 --> 00:17:34,282
I'm a professional singer

241
00:17:34,282 --> 00:17:40,282
I'm the only one who can sing and dance

242
00:17:40,282 --> 00:17:41,282
It's perfect

243
00:17:41,282 --> 00:17:42,282
Thank you

244
00:17:42,282 --> 00:17:43,282
It's good here

245
00:17:43,282 --> 00:17:46,282
Matsuno is doing well in the recording

246
00:17:46,282 --> 00:17:48,282
However

247
00:17:48,282 --> 00:17:50,282
It's getting rough

248
00:17:50,282 --> 00:17:51,282
It's good

249
00:17:52,282 --> 00:17:54,282
The recording that took a long time

250
00:17:54,282 --> 00:17:56,282
Something is wrong with her throat

251
00:17:56,282 --> 00:17:59,568
The recording is interrupted

252
00:17:59,568 --> 00:18:01,568
Are you drinking water?

253
00:18:01,568 --> 00:18:03,568
Yes, I'm drinking water

254
00:18:03,568 --> 00:18:11,568
I think you can relax after listening to
the high notes

255
00:18:11,568 --> 00:18:16,080
As the same vocalist, Matsuno is noticed

256
00:18:16,080 --> 00:18:18,080
Then

257
00:18:18,080 --> 00:18:20,080
Let's go

258
00:18:20,080 --> 00:18:25,080
After recovering, she takes the last
block

259
00:18:25,080 --> 00:18:33,080
This is the last song, so please sing
with the highest tension

260
00:18:33,080 --> 00:18:39,080
Moratorium, Moratorium, Junior High
School Student

261
00:18:39,080 --> 00:18:41,080
Perfect

262
00:18:41,080 --> 00:18:43,080
Thank you

263
00:18:43,080 --> 00:18:46,080
Thank you

264
00:18:46,432 --> 00:18:53,432
So, 8 students from the spring break
moratorium school finished recording

265
00:18:56,432 --> 00:18:57,432
A few days later

266

has finished the mix

268
00:19:08,432 --> 00:19:09,432
Finally

269
00:19:09,432 --> 00:19:12,048
Thank you for your hard work!

270
