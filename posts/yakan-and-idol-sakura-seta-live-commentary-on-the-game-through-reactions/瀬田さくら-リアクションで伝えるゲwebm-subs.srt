1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
I first started playing games when I was
4 years old.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:09,000
I'm really into Apex now.

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:12,000
I love FPS games.

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:16,000
I try to avoid games that make me think
I'm a girl.

5
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:19,000
I try to make myself a male player.

6
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:22,960
Hello, everyone.

7
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:27,840
I'm SAKURA, the member of BATTEEN.

8
00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:30,360
Nice to meet you.

9
00:00:31,360 --> 00:00:33,760
I'm nervous.

10
00:00:33,760 --> 00:00:38,320
I've never filmed a video of me showing
you my work.

11
00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:40,480
I'll do my best.

12
00:00:40,480 --> 00:00:43,320
I haven't heard what I'm going to do
today.

13
00:00:43,320 --> 00:00:45,880
I'm wondering what I'm going to do.

14
00:00:45,880 --> 00:00:48,560
I'm sitting here.

15
00:00:48,560 --> 00:00:54,760
I'll look for a hint.

16
00:00:54,760 --> 00:00:56,600
This is suspicious.

17
00:00:56,600 --> 00:00:59,520
This is definitely suspicious.

18
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:00,520
Is this this?

19
00:01:00,520 --> 00:01:07,760
SAKURA, you are in an invisible game.

20
00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:10,840
Did I do that?

21
00:01:10,840 --> 00:01:12,480
I didn't do that.

22
00:01:12,480 --> 00:01:19,640
To improve your ability to speak and
your ability to talk, I will not reveal
what game you are playing.

23
00:01:19,640 --> 00:01:28,064
Please play the game without showing the
game screen.

24
00:01:28,064 --> 00:01:33,064
Please play the game without showing the
game screen.

25
00:01:33,466 --> 00:01:38,466
I'm going to play the game now.

26
00:01:38,466 --> 00:01:42,466
I haven't played the game recently, so
I'm looking forward to playing it.

27
00:01:42,466 --> 00:01:48,466
And the game I'm going to play this time
is a game I've never played.

28
00:01:48,466 --> 00:01:59,466
I've played a lot of Nintendo games, but
I avoided playing this game because I
thought it might be dangerous if I got
addicted to it.

29
00:01:59,466 --> 00:02:02,466
I'm going to play it this time.

30
00:02:02,466 --> 00:02:05,466
I will start with the character.

31
00:02:05,466 --> 00:02:06,466
What should I do?

32
00:02:06,466 --> 00:02:11,466
I like girls and boys.

33
00:02:11,466 --> 00:02:13,466
The color of the eyes is purple.

34
00:02:13,466 --> 00:02:15,466
The hairstyle is cute.

35
00:02:15,466 --> 00:02:19,466
I've seen the game's live broadcast.

36
00:02:19,466 --> 00:02:24,466
I saw a cute hairstyle on VTUBER.

37
00:02:24,466 --> 00:02:25,466
I will play this game.

38
00:02:25,466 --> 00:02:32,466
I was asked to play a cute hairstyle
today.

39
00:02:32,466 --> 00:02:37,466
I often play the game with straight
hair.

40
00:02:37,466 --> 00:02:38,466
I will play this game.

41
00:02:38,466 --> 00:02:41,466
I will also play this game with
eyebrows.

42
00:02:41,466 --> 00:02:46,466
Finally, I will play this game.

43
00:02:46,466 --> 00:02:48,466
I will play this game with short pants.

44
00:02:48,466 --> 00:02:52,400
I was able to play this game.

45
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:54,400
Look at this!

46
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:55,400
Wow!

47
00:02:55,400 --> 00:02:58,400
I got a weapon.

48
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:01,400
I have a weapon that I want to use.

49
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:06,400
I have a big roller.

50
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:10,400
I think it would be interesting to play
a long-range weapon.

51
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:15,168
Please book your hand!

52
00:03:15,168 --> 00:03:20,168
No, I can't move this screen.

53
00:03:22,168 --> 00:03:23,168
Good luck!

54
00:03:23,168 --> 00:03:26,168
I'm embarrassed. I look like a clumsy
person.

55
00:03:26,168 --> 00:03:30,448
Thank you for watching.

56
00:03:30,448 --> 00:03:32,448
I have seen this park.

57
00:03:32,448 --> 00:03:38,448
Octopuses are flying.

58
00:03:38,448 --> 00:03:45,448
I wonder what the old man will do with
me.

59
00:03:45,448 --> 00:03:50,176
I get a salmon roe.

60
00:03:50,176 --> 00:03:52,176
Good luck!

61
00:03:52,176 --> 00:03:56,176
I'm not used to this game yet.

62
00:03:58,176 --> 00:04:01,176
I can't get a salmon roe unless I
control it.

63
00:04:01,176 --> 00:04:03,176
I wonder if I can get it today.

64
00:04:03,176 --> 00:04:06,176
But I don't think I'm defending myself.

65
00:04:06,176 --> 00:04:09,176
I'm not sure if I can get it.

66
00:04:10,176 --> 00:04:12,176
This is a local salmon roe.

67
00:04:13,176 --> 00:04:14,176
This is cute.

68
00:04:14,176 --> 00:04:20,176
This salmon roe is eating my face.

69
00:04:22,176 --> 00:04:23,176
I throw this.

70
00:04:24,176 --> 00:04:26,176
This salmon roe is running.

71
00:04:26,176 --> 00:04:28,176
I got it.

72
00:04:28,176 --> 00:04:36,794
This is difficult.

73
00:04:36,794 --> 00:04:38,794
I got it!

74
00:04:38,794 --> 00:04:40,794
I got the engine number.

75
00:04:42,794 --> 00:04:44,794
I think I'm getting used to it.

76
00:04:44,794 --> 00:04:46,794
I'm getting used to it.

77
00:04:46,794 --> 00:04:50,794
I want to play a online match.

78
00:04:50,794 --> 00:04:54,794
I'm sure I'll be able to cause trouble.

79
00:04:54,794 --> 00:04:56,794
I'll do my best.

80
00:04:56,794 --> 00:05:01,794
I'll do my best with a low-ranking team.

81
00:05:01,794 --> 00:05:06,064
I'll do my best not to lose.

82
00:05:06,064 --> 00:05:14,064
I changed the setting, so I'll play
online.

83
00:05:14,064 --> 00:05:16,064
Can I really do it?

84
00:05:16,064 --> 00:05:18,064
The game is starting.

85
00:05:18,064 --> 00:05:21,064
This game is very fast.

86
00:05:21,064 --> 00:05:24,064
This is a very strong opponent.

87
00:05:24,064 --> 00:05:26,064
I'm sorry.

88
00:05:28,064 --> 00:05:30,064
I'll put this on.

89
00:05:32,064 --> 00:05:34,064
This is very difficult.

90
00:05:34,064 --> 00:05:36,064
I have to turn my back.

91
00:05:36,064 --> 00:05:38,064
I died.

92
00:05:38,064 --> 00:05:40,064
This is difficult.

93
00:05:40,064 --> 00:05:42,064
I'm losing.

94
00:05:45,064 --> 00:05:47,064
I will advance.

95
00:05:49,064 --> 00:05:51,064
I will take the back.

96
00:05:51,064 --> 00:05:53,064
I have only one minute left.

97
00:05:53,064 --> 00:05:55,064
I don't have to kill anyone.

98
00:05:55,064 --> 00:06:00,576
I lost.

99
00:06:00,576 --> 00:06:02,576
I'm scared.

100
00:06:06,576 --> 00:06:08,576
I lost.

101
00:06:10,576 --> 00:06:12,576
I'm frustrated.

102
00:06:12,576 --> 00:06:14,576
I lost overwhelmingly.

103
00:06:14,576 --> 00:06:16,576
This is not good.

104
00:06:16,576 --> 00:06:18,576
I'm sorry.

105
00:06:19,576 --> 00:06:22,576
I change my weapon.

106
00:06:22,576 --> 00:06:24,576
I change to a wakabashuta.

107
00:06:24,576 --> 00:06:28,032
I lost.

108
00:06:28,032 --> 00:06:30,032
I will do my best.

109
00:06:30,032 --> 00:06:32,032
Is there a way to aim at the target?

110
00:06:32,032 --> 00:06:34,032
I was right.

111
00:06:36,032 --> 00:06:37,032
I will do my best.

112
00:06:37,032 --> 00:06:40,032
I can't say that I'm playing a game with
this.

113
00:06:40,032 --> 00:06:44,368
I will do my best.

114
00:06:44,368 --> 00:06:46,368
I'm doing my best.

115
00:06:49,288 --> 00:06:52,168
I feel that the number of people who die
is decreasing.

116
00:06:52,168 --> 00:06:53,648
I will do my best.

117
00:06:53,648 --> 00:07:00,538
Please subscribe to my channel.

118
00:07:00,538 --> 00:07:03,538
I was talking about my tongue.

119
00:07:03,538 --> 00:07:05,538
This is not good.

120
00:07:05,538 --> 00:07:07,538
This is a big explosion.

121
00:07:07,538 --> 00:07:08,538
This is not good.

122
00:07:08,538 --> 00:07:10,538
I'm not good at this.

123
00:07:10,538 --> 00:07:13,538
I want to kill one person.

124
00:07:13,538 --> 00:07:15,538
This is not good.

125
00:07:15,538 --> 00:07:18,538
This is not good.

126
00:07:18,538 --> 00:07:22,352
This is the end.

127
00:07:22,352 --> 00:07:25,912
I can't get 1kg.

128
00:07:25,912 --> 00:07:29,672
I won because my friend was strong.

129
00:07:29,672 --> 00:07:30,872
He was very kind.

130
00:07:30,872 --> 00:07:33,472
I thought he was dangerous.

131
00:07:33,472 --> 00:07:34,912
He came to help me.

132
00:07:34,912 --> 00:07:38,192
It seems that there are many kind people
in this game.

133
00:07:41,472 --> 00:07:42,512
I can do it.

134
00:07:42,512 --> 00:07:43,032
I can do it.

135
00:07:43,032 --> 00:07:45,992
I was close.

136
00:07:45,992 --> 00:07:47,992
I was close.

137
00:07:47,992 --> 00:07:52,752
I was blocked by a umbrella.

138
00:07:52,768 --> 00:07:56,768
I think I can move faster if I try this.

139
00:07:56,768 --> 00:07:58,768
This is good.

140
00:07:58,768 --> 00:08:01,768
I did it! I did it!

141
00:08:01,768 --> 00:08:02,768
I defeated it! I defeated it!

142
00:08:02,768 --> 00:08:03,768
I'm going to die.

143
00:08:03,768 --> 00:08:04,768
This is bad.

144
00:08:10,768 --> 00:08:12,768
This is too strong.

145
00:08:13,768 --> 00:08:14,768
Look at the back.

146
00:08:14,768 --> 00:08:16,768
This is bad.

147
00:08:16,768 --> 00:08:17,768
This is bad.

148
00:08:17,768 --> 00:08:22,768
This is bad.

149
00:08:22,848 --> 00:08:25,848
No, the board is not good.

150
00:08:25,848 --> 00:08:27,848
I was defeated.

151
00:08:27,848 --> 00:08:29,848
This is strong.

152
00:08:29,848 --> 00:08:31,848
This is a big problem.

153
00:08:31,848 --> 00:08:36,848
This is the only coat that can fight.

154
00:08:36,848 --> 00:08:42,848
This is the only coat that can fight.

155
00:08:42,848 --> 00:08:47,456
I won because I was able to win one.

156
00:08:47,456 --> 00:08:49,456
I'm going to play a game now.

157
00:08:49,456 --> 00:08:52,456
Do you know what game I played?

158
00:08:52,456 --> 00:08:55,456
I hope you understand.

159
00:08:55,456 --> 00:08:57,456
Finally, I will give you a hint.

160
00:08:57,456 --> 00:09:03,456
I will give you a gesture for those who
do not understand.

161
00:09:03,456 --> 00:09:06,456
I will do the movement of the character
I just played.

162
00:09:06,456 --> 00:09:10,456
I have this kind of hair.

163
00:09:10,456 --> 00:09:15,456
I can't get this hair out of my head.

164
00:09:15,456 --> 00:09:19,456
I will do this.

165
00:09:19,456 --> 00:09:22,456
I will get the kill.

166
00:09:22,456 --> 00:09:25,456
I played a game for the first time
today.

167
00:09:25,456 --> 00:09:29,456
I was able to defeat one enemy.

168
00:09:29,456 --> 00:09:33,456
I am very satisfied today.

169
00:09:33,456 --> 00:09:35,456
This is my personal impression.

170
00:09:35,456 --> 00:09:36,456
I am very satisfied.

171
00:09:36,456 --> 00:09:39,456
I think I was able to win.

172
00:09:39,456 --> 00:09:44,456
If you understand this game, please
leave a comment.

173
00:09:44,456 --> 00:09:49,456
I will tell you the answer.

174
00:09:49,456 --> 00:09:51,456
Please leave a lot of comments.

175
00:09:51,456 --> 00:09:54,456
I will end this video here.

176
00:09:54,456 --> 00:09:57,136
Bye bye.

177
00:09:57,136 --> 00:09:59,136
Please subscribe to my channel.

178
00:09:59,456 --> 00:10:04,456
It's time to make sweets.

179
00:10:04,456 --> 00:10:07,456
I don't make sweets because I want to
eat it.

180
00:10:07,456 --> 00:10:12,456
I will clean the sweet potatoes.

181
00:10:12,456 --> 00:10:16,456
I'm scared.

182
00:10:16,456 --> 00:10:18,456
I can't open it at all.

183
00:10:18,456 --> 00:10:20,456
I think I'm going to run out of
electricity.

184
00:10:20,456 --> 00:10:25,456
I'm always told that I use a saw when I
use a kitchen knife.

185
00:10:25,456 --> 00:10:30,456
I've never used this before.

186
00:10:30,456 --> 00:10:31,456
I will start.

187
00:10:31,456 --> 00:10:34,456
I will add vanilla extract.

188
00:10:34,456 --> 00:10:40,456
I added too much.

189
00:10:40,456 --> 00:10:45,456
I don't know because I've never made it,
but it's important to mix it.

190
00:10:45,456 --> 00:10:55,456
It's done.
