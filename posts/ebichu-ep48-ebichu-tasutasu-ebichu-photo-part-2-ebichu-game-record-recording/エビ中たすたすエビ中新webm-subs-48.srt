00:00:00,794 --> 00:00:06,794
This week's Ebichu Tastas is Ebichu
Tastas photo part 2

2
00:00:06,794 --> 00:00:10,794
A photo contest where members take a
photo of each other

3
00:00:10,794 --> 00:00:11,794
Then

4
00:00:11,794 --> 00:00:15,794
It feels good, oh no, oh no, oh no

5
00:00:16,794 --> 00:00:20,794
What kind of photo will be completed?

6
00:00:20,794 --> 00:00:23,794
Ebichu Tastas start

7
00:00:23,794 --> 00:00:29,794
Ebichu Tastas

8
00:00:50,138 --> 00:01:12,198
By measuring the length of the

9
00:01:12,198 --> 00:01:14,398
It may dry well after 100 days.

10
00:01:14,678 --> 00:01:17,978
It can be useful only when it has a good
equations.

11
00:01:17,978 --> 00:01:18,554
Thank you for watching!

12
00:01:18,554 --> 00:01:23,554
This program is brought to you by these
sponsors.

13
00:01:33,370 --> 00:01:42,304
Continuing from the previous episode, we
will be separating into pairs and will
be holding a contest to take the cutest
photos of each other.

14
00:01:42,304 --> 00:01:49,304
The members take pictures of the
students in a free setting and decide
the best one.

15
00:01:49,304 --> 00:01:58,304
The pictures are taken by a professional
photographer, Mr. Kunitake, who is also
a professional cameraman.

16
00:01:58,304 --> 00:02:03,304
The members who are the best are given a
camera as a prize.

17
00:02:03,304 --> 00:02:05,304
Finally, the shooting begins!

18
00:02:05,304 --> 00:02:12,304
The pair of Mayama and Matsu are taking
pictures in a free setting.

19
00:02:13,114 --> 00:02:17,114
The cameraman, Mayama, is busy with
something.

20
00:02:17,114 --> 00:02:31,494
Then he finds a bat in the

21
00:02:31,494 --> 00:02:37,168
item.

22
00:02:37,168 --> 00:02:40,768
She is not cute at all, so she doesn't
like bat.

23
00:02:41,468 --> 00:02:43,768
She takes a picture again in front of
the cigarette box.

24
00:02:46,568 --> 00:02:48,768
She checks the picture she took
immediately.

25
00:02:49,468 --> 00:02:50,568
Then...

26
00:02:52,568 --> 00:02:53,368
Let's go.

27
00:02:53,668 --> 00:02:54,368
Are you okay?

28
00:02:54,368 --> 00:02:55,168
You are fast.

29
00:02:55,968 --> 00:02:56,668
You are fast.

30
00:02:57,468 --> 00:02:58,468
Are you really okay?

31
00:02:58,468 --> 00:03:04,528
Apparently, she took a picture of her
whole body.

32
00:03:04,528 --> 00:03:07,528
Now, Matsuno is the cameraman.

33
00:03:07,528 --> 00:03:10,528
She chose the rooftop for the shooting.

34
00:03:11,528 --> 00:03:13,528
Please come in.

35
00:03:15,528 --> 00:03:18,528
I want to be kind and warm.

36
00:03:18,528 --> 00:03:20,528
Oh, you want to be kind and warm.

37
00:03:23,528 --> 00:03:29,528
Matsuno, who is a model and has taken
many photos, gives more and more
accurate instructions.

38
00:03:29,528 --> 00:03:34,458
Please come in.

39
00:03:34,458 --> 00:03:36,458
OK

40
00:03:36,458 --> 00:03:40,458
It's good, it feels like I'm going to
turn around

41
00:03:40,458 --> 00:03:46,458
Matsuno has a secret weapon here

42
00:03:46,458 --> 00:03:48,458
I'll enter here

43
00:03:48,458 --> 00:03:50,458
The eyes

44
00:03:50,458 --> 00:03:56,458
While Matsuno was going to the roof, she
borrowed eye drops from the makeup
artist

45
00:03:56,458 --> 00:03:58,458
I like this one eye

46
00:03:58,458 --> 00:04:00,458
This one?

47
00:04:00,458 --> 00:04:02,458
Stop it

48
00:04:02,458 --> 00:04:03,232
I'll enter here

49
00:04:03,232 --> 00:04:07,232
What is the picture of a secret weapon
using eye drops?

50
00:04:09,626 --> 00:04:13,626
It's good. Oh, no.

51
00:04:14,626 --> 00:04:19,626
Meanwhile, Hirota and Hoshina are
shooting in the classroom.

52
00:04:19,626 --> 00:04:22,626
There is a secret weapon here, too.

53
00:04:22,626 --> 00:04:23,626
That is...

54
00:04:23,626 --> 00:04:25,626
Ref-1.

55
00:04:25,626 --> 00:04:26,626
Ref-1.

56
00:04:26,626 --> 00:04:28,626
Ref-1 with feeling.

57
00:04:29,626 --> 00:04:31,626
What a surprise!

58
00:04:31,626 --> 00:04:35,626
The strategy is to remove the cloak of
the costume and reflect the gloss.

59
00:04:35,626 --> 00:04:41,626
Can they use the reflection of light
well?

60
00:04:43,792 --> 00:04:45,792
Not at all!

61
00:04:45,792 --> 00:04:48,552
It's not a

62
00:04:48,552 --> 00:04:49,552
dragonfly!

63
00:04:49,552 --> 00:04:55,792
Hoshina gave up on the cloak and took a
picture near the window where the light
gathers.

64
00:04:55,792 --> 00:04:59,792
This is really good! I want to take it
again!

65
00:04:59,792 --> 00:05:03,792
Apparently, she took a picture of her
favorite.

66
00:05:03,792 --> 00:05:07,792
Next, Hirota is a cameraman.

67
00:05:07,792 --> 00:05:13,792
Here, too, he gave instructions to
remove the cloak immediately.

68
00:05:14,202 --> 00:05:16,202
I'll put it a little closer.

69
00:05:22,202 --> 00:05:25,202
I don't know much about men,

70
00:05:25,202 --> 00:05:29,202
because I'm alone with a girl.

71
00:05:29,202 --> 00:05:32,208
What do you think about this picture?

72
00:05:32,208 --> 00:05:40,208
I want to take a picture that comes out
of the story.

73
00:05:41,208 --> 00:05:44,208
Hirota wants to take a picture with a
story.

74
00:05:44,208 --> 00:05:48,208
Next, he went to the back of the school.

75
00:05:48,208 --> 00:05:56,448
Then, he started to arrange colorful
envelopes around Hoshina.

76
00:05:56,448 --> 00:06:00,448
What is the story of this picture that
Hirota is aiming for?

77
00:06:01,448 --> 00:06:04,448
What kind of work will be completed?

78
00:06:06,448 --> 00:06:09,448
On the other hand, Yasumoto and
Kashiwagi pair...

79
00:06:10,448 --> 00:06:12,448
Oh, I was wrong.

80
00:06:13,448 --> 00:06:15,448
Oh, the video has started.

81
00:06:15,448 --> 00:06:16,448
Why?

82
00:06:16,448 --> 00:06:23,504
Last time, Yasumoto was worried about
the camera's operation.

83
00:06:23,504 --> 00:06:27,504
She changed the location after getting
used to it.

84
00:06:27,504 --> 00:06:30,504
The destination is the castle.

85
00:06:30,504 --> 00:06:32,504
Ready, go!

86
00:06:33,504 --> 00:06:35,504
Why are you running?

87
00:06:37,504 --> 00:06:39,504
Cute!

88
00:06:39,504 --> 00:06:40,504
Good!

89
00:06:40,504 --> 00:06:41,504
One more time!

90
00:06:41,504 --> 00:06:49,504
Phew!

91
00:06:49,936 --> 00:06:59,936
They try to shoot a model running, but
as you can see, the size and focus are
not good.

92
00:07:02,936 --> 00:07:03,936
What is this?

93
00:07:04,936 --> 00:07:08,936
Still, they keep shooting. What kind of
picture will they get?

94
00:07:09,936 --> 00:07:12,936
Next, Kashiwagi is the cameraman.

95
00:07:12,936 --> 00:07:18,096
It's like a club activity.

96
00:07:18,096 --> 00:07:20,096
Don't look at me.

97
00:07:21,096 --> 00:07:23,096
Be careful not to get bitten.

98
00:07:24,096 --> 00:07:26,096
Wait a minute.

99
00:07:27,096 --> 00:07:29,096
Let me go again.

100
00:07:31,096 --> 00:07:36,096
Yasumoto is struggling with the
movement.

101
00:07:36,096 --> 00:07:41,488
Will this pair be okay?

102
00:07:41,488 --> 00:07:44,388
And the Kobayashi-Nakayama pair

103
00:07:44,388 --> 00:07:49,988
Kobayashi was very particular about
taking a picture of Nakayama in the
flask last time

104
00:07:49,988 --> 00:07:55,988
However, they finally realized that the
key point is not to show their faces

105
00:07:55,988 --> 00:07:59,988
So the flask gave up and went to the
ground

106
00:07:59,988 --> 00:08:02,988
When they found a yu-gu space with tires

107
00:08:03,988 --> 00:08:08,988
In this circle, not in the circle, but a
little bit there

108
00:08:08,988 --> 00:08:10,988
The first photo

109
00:08:12,988 --> 00:08:15,988
They really want to put Nakayama in
something

110
00:08:15,988 --> 00:08:18,988
What is this strong commitment?

111
00:08:19,988 --> 00:08:22,988
It seems that the daughter is taking a
picture

112
00:08:22,988 --> 00:08:24,988
Why do you think it's a daughter?

113
00:08:24,988 --> 00:08:26,988
Eh, somehow

114
00:08:26,988 --> 00:08:28,000
Thank you for your viewing. Please
subscribe to the channel.

115
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,000
Because it's cute.

116
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,000
I'm scared.

117
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,000
I'm scared.

118
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,000
I don't want to be there.

119
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,000
For some reason, the mother bird has
started to grow.

120
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:42,000
Nakayama starts shooting.

121
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:46,000
Then Nakayama called me like this.

122
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,000
Please let me shake it.

123
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:55,000
The producer of the program said he
wanted to shake it.

124
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,472
Please subscribe to the channel.

125
00:08:57,472 --> 00:08:59,296
Thank you for your viewing.

126
00:08:59,296 --> 00:09:02,296
Kaho, close your eyes.

127
00:09:04,296 --> 00:09:06,296
One more time.

128
00:09:07,296 --> 00:09:12,296
To make her more relaxed, she takes
pictures of the girls.

129
00:09:13,296 --> 00:09:15,296
One, two, three.

130
00:09:16,296 --> 00:09:18,296
What's this?

131
00:09:18,296 --> 00:09:20,296
Close your eyes.

132
00:09:22,296 --> 00:09:24,296
It's better to look at the back.

133
00:09:24,296 --> 00:09:28,296
Kobayashi closes her eyes at the timing
of shutter.

134
00:09:28,296 --> 00:09:30,296
Then, Nakayama...

135
00:09:31,296 --> 00:09:33,296
One, two, three.

136
00:09:35,296 --> 00:09:36,296
No.

137
00:09:36,296 --> 00:09:38,296
I took a picture.

138
00:09:38,296 --> 00:09:40,296
I was late.

139
00:09:40,296 --> 00:09:42,296
I was late.

140
00:09:43,296 --> 00:09:48,296
She takes pictures of the falling leaves
at the timing of shutter.

141
00:09:49,296 --> 00:09:55,296
She uses her staff to take pictures of
the girls.

142
00:09:55,296 --> 00:10:00,296
After taking pictures of each member,
the shooting is over.

143
00:10:00,296 --> 00:10:03,296
After this, we will announce the work.

144
00:10:03,296 --> 00:10:05,296
Before that...

145
00:10:05,296 --> 00:10:11,168
Emi-Chuu Game Quest

146
00:10:11,168 --> 00:10:16,168
Emi-Chuu Game Quest is in progress!

147
00:10:18,096 --> 00:10:24,096
In the previous episode, we revealed the
characters of the members who appear in
the game.

148
00:10:24,096 --> 00:10:32,096
In fact, this game has an episode part
where you can fight the enemy and talk
to the members.

149
00:10:32,096 --> 00:10:38,096
In that episode, the members move with a
rich expression.

150
00:10:38,096 --> 00:10:41,096
Furthermore, all the lines are the voice
of the person.

151
00:10:41,096 --> 00:10:49,096
So, this time, the members of Emi-Chuu
will challenge the overflowing
character.

152
00:10:49,096 --> 00:10:55,096
They have prepared a lot of lines that
match the character's movement.

153
00:10:55,096 --> 00:10:58,096
First, Yasumoto.

154
00:10:58,096 --> 00:11:00,096
Have you ever done overflowing?

155
00:11:00,096 --> 00:11:02,096
No.

156
00:11:02,096 --> 00:11:03,096
No?

157
00:11:03,096 --> 00:11:04,096
No.

158
00:11:04,096 --> 00:11:08,096
I was a little nervous.

159
00:11:08,096 --> 00:11:12,096
Yasumoto is the first to challenge
overflowing.

160
00:11:12,096 --> 00:11:15,096
Ehhhhhh?

161
00:11:15,632 --> 00:11:17,632
Thank you.

162
00:11:17,632 --> 00:11:19,632
It's good, but...

163
00:11:19,632 --> 00:11:21,632
It's a bit too much.

164
00:11:21,632 --> 00:11:23,632
I think it's a bit too much.

165
00:11:23,632 --> 00:11:25,632
I think it's a bit too much.

166
00:11:25,632 --> 00:11:29,200
Ehhhh?

167
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:31,200
Thank you very much

168
00:11:32,040 --> 00:11:36,080
What is your first impression of the
first overflowing

169
00:11:36,080 --> 00:11:39,080
When I say this line

170
00:11:39,080 --> 00:11:40,920
I'm a little bit

171
00:11:40,920 --> 00:11:44,400
It's like a little bit

172
00:11:44,400 --> 00:11:47,400
I'm embarrassed to think that I'm
watching it

173
00:11:47,400 --> 00:11:51,400
This is also the first challenge of
overflowing

174
00:11:51,400 --> 00:11:57,184
Please number 32

175
00:11:57,184 --> 00:11:59,184
Something different

176
00:11:59,184 --> 00:12:01,184
Something different

177
00:12:03,184 --> 00:12:05,184
Please do it once

178
00:12:11,184 --> 00:12:15,184
Next is Mayama who has voice acting
experience in anime

179
00:12:15,184 --> 00:12:17,184
Her skill is

180
00:12:17,184 --> 00:12:23,184
After the bath

181
00:12:25,040 --> 00:12:27,340
You look great. I'm surprised.

182
00:12:27,340 --> 00:12:29,340
Thank you.

183
00:12:30,040 --> 00:12:32,840
Next, number 8.

184
00:12:32,840 --> 00:12:35,340
Mayama, fighting!

185
00:12:37,540 --> 00:12:39,840
Mayama did it perfectly.

186
00:12:39,840 --> 00:12:44,656
By the way, what's your favorite line?

187
00:12:44,656 --> 00:12:46,656
Battle part!

188
00:12:48,656 --> 00:12:51,656
I like the system voice more.

189
00:12:52,656 --> 00:12:58,656
I'm Hinata Kashiwagi, the always smiling
toy boy in Ebichu, who is more cheerful
than sunny day.

190
00:12:58,656 --> 00:13:00,656
A.A.O.!

191
00:13:00,656 --> 00:13:02,656
Let's play!

192
00:13:03,656 --> 00:13:05,656
Let's eat!

193
00:13:05,656 --> 00:13:07,656
I.A. special!

194
00:13:08,656 --> 00:13:13,656
This is the end of the pre-recording
that took advantage of the individuality
of the members.

195
00:13:13,656 --> 00:13:15,656
How do you feel about the game? It seems
to be fun.

196
00:13:15,656 --> 00:13:17,656
I'm really looking forward to it.

197
00:13:19,656 --> 00:13:24,656
And finally, the game in Ebichu is
ready!

198
00:13:25,656 --> 00:13:28,656
The game project is at the final stage
of completion.

199
00:13:29,656 --> 00:13:33,656
We will announce the details soon!

200
00:13:33,656 --> 00:13:34,656
Please look forward to it!

201
00:13:36,656 --> 00:13:40,656
After this, the results of the Ebichu
photo contest will be announced.

202
00:13:40,656 --> 00:13:44,656
Who will win?

203
00:13:46,672 --> 00:13:47,792
Who will win?

204
00:13:47,792 --> 00:13:51,792
Both members take the cutest photos
together.

205
00:13:51,792 --> 00:13:54,792
Ebichu Photo Contest.

206
00:13:55,792 --> 00:14:00,792
Finally, the photos taken by the members
are announced.

207
00:14:00,792 --> 00:14:02,792
Let's start with Mayama.

208
00:14:02,792 --> 00:14:04,792
What is the theme?

209
00:14:04,792 --> 00:14:07,792
The theme is a simple photo with a
cigarette.

210
00:14:07,792 --> 00:14:12,792
The theme of Mayama's work is a simple
photo with a cigarette.

211
00:14:12,792 --> 00:14:16,792
What kind of side of Matsuno did he
bring out?

212
00:14:16,792 --> 00:14:18,792
Let's take a look.

213
00:14:18,792 --> 00:14:24,858
This is the photo I took.

214
00:14:24,858 --> 00:14:26,858
The color is amazing

215
00:14:26,858 --> 00:14:27,858
What is this?

216
00:14:27,858 --> 00:14:29,858
Did you paint something?

217
00:14:29,858 --> 00:14:32,858
When I was shooting, there was a person
who changed the color

218
00:14:32,858 --> 00:14:35,858
I thought it would be like a school
uniform

219
00:14:35,858 --> 00:14:38,858
I painted it like a school uniform

220
00:14:38,858 --> 00:14:40,858
It's a sunset

221
00:14:40,858 --> 00:14:44,858
By the way, do you have a face
expression or aim?

222
00:14:44,858 --> 00:14:47,858
After all, I didn't make it

223
00:14:47,858 --> 00:14:51,858
I heard a voice and looked at it

224
00:14:51,858 --> 00:14:53,858
Like this

225
00:14:53,858 --> 00:14:55,858
I can do that face

226
00:14:55,858 --> 00:14:58,858
I took it with a very quiet feeling

227
00:14:58,858 --> 00:15:02,858
I did my best because it was said that
it was natural

228
00:15:03,858 --> 00:15:05,858
Next, Matsuno's work

229
00:15:05,858 --> 00:15:09,858
The theme is a sad feeling on the roof

230
00:15:09,858 --> 00:15:13,858
What is the one that was particular
about Mayama's expression?

231
00:15:13,858 --> 00:15:14,858
Let's see

232
00:15:14,858 --> 00:15:16,576
Thank you for your viewing

233
00:15:16,576 --> 00:15:18,464
Good!

234
00:15:18,464 --> 00:15:20,464
She looks sad

235
00:15:20,464 --> 00:15:24,464
She's crying?

236
00:15:24,464 --> 00:15:26,464
Yes

237
00:15:26,464 --> 00:15:32,464
She used eye drops

238
00:15:32,464 --> 00:15:34,464
No

239
00:15:34,464 --> 00:15:36,464
She's laughing

240
00:15:36,464 --> 00:15:38,464
She didn't say anything

241
00:15:38,464 --> 00:15:41,464
She said she didn't borrow money

242
00:15:41,464 --> 00:15:43,464
I see

243
00:15:43,464 --> 00:15:47,464
She's crying

244
00:15:47,464 --> 00:15:49,464
She looks sad

245
00:15:49,464 --> 00:15:51,464
She's crying

246
00:15:51,464 --> 00:15:53,464
I see

247
00:15:53,464 --> 00:15:55,464
Kobayashi

248
00:15:55,464 --> 00:15:57,464
The theme is Ginjiro Nakayama

249
00:15:57,464 --> 00:15:59,464
It's amazing

250
00:15:59,464 --> 00:16:01,464
It's amazing

251
00:16:01,464 --> 00:16:06,464
The theme of Kobayashi's work is Ginjiro
Nakayama

252
00:16:06,464 --> 00:16:11,520
I can't imagine what kind of photo it is
from the title

253
00:16:11,520 --> 00:16:15,200
What does it mean? I don't know the
title, but let's take a look

254
00:16:15,200 --> 00:16:16,400
Here it is

255
00:16:18,400 --> 00:16:20,400
I see

256
00:16:20,400 --> 00:16:22,400
It's Jinomirya Kinjirou

257
00:16:22,400 --> 00:16:24,400
It's Nakayama Ginjirou

258
00:16:24,400 --> 00:16:26,400
It's a Japanese-style Gin

259
00:16:26,400 --> 00:16:28,400
I know that

260
00:16:28,400 --> 00:16:32,800
There were many other statues, but only
Ginjirou was left

261
00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:34,800
I see

262
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:36,800
The other statues were also taken

263
00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:40,320
The only one left is Nakayama Ginjirou

264
00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:42,320
There is such a story

265
00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:44,320
It's not a ninja training

266
00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:48,320
Next is Nakayama Ginjirou's work

267
00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:52,320
The theme is Rinanann pose evolution

268
00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:54,320
Rinanann pose evolution?

269
00:16:54,320 --> 00:16:56,320
What does it mean?

270
00:16:56,320 --> 00:16:58,320
By the way, Rinanann pose

271
00:16:58,320 --> 00:16:58,688
Please subscribe to my channel

272
00:16:58,688 --> 00:17:06,688
Please subscribe to my channel

273
00:17:06,688 --> 00:17:09,448
The attention is here.

274
00:17:09,448 --> 00:17:11,848
This is the hand.

275
00:17:12,488 --> 00:17:14,048
NAKAYAMA SAKE.

276
00:17:14,048 --> 00:17:16,328
RINANAN POSE.

277
00:17:16,328 --> 00:17:19,968
Did she use the fallen leaves well?

278
00:17:21,128 --> 00:17:22,528
Let's see.

279
00:17:25,808 --> 00:17:26,888
I see.

280
00:17:26,888 --> 00:17:28,928
What is this?

281
00:17:29,488 --> 00:17:30,488
What is this?

282
00:17:30,488 --> 00:17:32,448
Is this a leaf?

283
00:17:32,448 --> 00:17:33,808
Is this a leaf?

284
00:17:33,808 --> 00:17:39,168
I was asked to cooperate with many
people.

285
00:17:39,168 --> 00:17:41,688
This is the result.

286
00:17:43,688 --> 00:17:45,288
I feel like I'm in trouble.

287
00:17:45,288 --> 00:17:46,128
What is this?

288
00:17:46,128 --> 00:17:49,568
Did you ask the staff to do this?

289
00:17:49,568 --> 00:17:51,528
This is a miracle leaf.

290
00:17:51,528 --> 00:17:53,768
This is a good timing.

291
00:17:53,768 --> 00:17:55,528
It's hard.

292
00:17:55,528 --> 00:17:58,048
This is RINANAN's evolution.

293
00:17:58,048 --> 00:18:00,488
I don't know if it's an evolution or a
experience.

294
00:18:00,488 --> 00:18:02,448
This is amazing.

295
00:18:02,448 --> 00:18:04,248
This is amazing.

296
00:18:04,248 --> 00:18:07,920
Next is YASUMOTO's work.

297
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:09,300
What is the theme?

298
00:18:09,300 --> 00:18:10,960
Your charm.

299
00:18:10,960 --> 00:18:12,960
Your charm?

300
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:14,960
That's amazing.

301
00:18:15,660 --> 00:18:19,600
YASUMOTO's theme is your charm.

302
00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:24,880
It was a shooting full of anxiety, but
the result is...

303
00:18:26,080 --> 00:18:29,080
I don't know if this is just a theme.

304
00:18:29,080 --> 00:18:30,280
Let's see.

305
00:18:30,280 --> 00:18:31,280
This is.

306
00:18:31,280 --> 00:18:35,280
YASUMOTO's work is a shooting full of
anxiety, but the result is...

307
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:41,280
The smile is cute, so I put a smile on
my face.

308
00:18:41,280 --> 00:18:44,280
How did you get this?

309
00:18:44,280 --> 00:18:51,280
I ran and ran and ran and ran and ran
and ran and ran and ran and ran and ran
and ran and ran and ran and ran and ran
and ran and ran and ran and ran and ran
and ran and ran and ran and ran and ran
and ran.

310
00:18:51,280 --> 00:18:52,280
Even after running?

311
00:18:52,280 --> 00:18:55,280
I'm chasing even if I run away.

312
00:18:55,280 --> 00:18:57,280
While writing?

313
00:18:57,280 --> 00:19:01,280
Especially at that time.

314
00:19:01,280 --> 00:19:02,280
I see.

315
00:19:02,280 --> 00:19:05,280
It's like a paparazzi.

316
00:19:05,280 --> 00:19:08,280
Next is KASHIWAGI. What is the theme?

317
00:19:08,280 --> 00:19:09,280
Let's do our best tomorrow.

318
00:19:09,280 --> 00:19:11,280
Let's do our best tomorrow.

319
00:19:11,280 --> 00:19:16,280
KASHIWAGI struggled to pull out the cute
part of YASUMOTO.

320
00:19:16,280 --> 00:19:19,280
The theme is, let's do our best
tomorrow.

321
00:19:20,280 --> 00:19:21,280
I'm curious.

322
00:19:21,280 --> 00:19:23,280
Let's see. Let's do our best tomorrow.

323
00:19:23,280 --> 00:19:24,280
This is.

324
00:19:24,280 --> 00:19:27,280
Let's do our best tomorrow.

325
00:19:27,280 --> 00:19:29,280
That's good.

326
00:19:29,280 --> 00:19:31,280
That's cool.

327
00:19:31,280 --> 00:19:33,280
That's super cool.

328
00:19:33,280 --> 00:19:34,280
That's super cool.

329
00:19:34,280 --> 00:19:35,280
That's not it.

330
00:19:35,280 --> 00:19:39,280
I just said just walk.

331
00:19:39,280 --> 00:19:43,280
I didn't practice because Aya-chan
suddenly did it.

332
00:19:43,280 --> 00:19:45,280
I was shooting at that time.

333
00:19:45,280 --> 00:19:47,280
I was shooting because I thought it was
dangerous.

334
00:19:47,280 --> 00:19:49,280
That's amazing.

335
00:19:49,280 --> 00:19:51,280
That's the first time I've seen it.

336
00:19:51,280 --> 00:19:54,280
Superheroes come home after finishing
their work.

337
00:19:54,280 --> 00:19:55,280
Let's do our best tomorrow.

338
00:19:55,280 --> 00:19:58,280
Because here, the left hand is
different.

339
00:19:58,280 --> 00:20:00,280
That's cool.

340
00:20:00,280 --> 00:20:04,280
This is a cute picture.

341
00:20:04,280 --> 00:20:06,280
I can't see your face.

342
00:20:06,280 --> 00:20:09,280
The back is cute.

343
00:20:09,280 --> 00:20:10,280
I see.

344
00:20:10,280 --> 00:20:12,280
The back is good.

345
00:20:12,280 --> 00:20:13,280
I see.

346
00:20:13,280 --> 00:20:15,280
I'm talking on my back.

347
00:20:15,280 --> 00:20:19,280
Next is HIROTA's work. What is the
theme?

348
00:20:19,280 --> 00:20:21,280
I'm alone.

349
00:20:21,280 --> 00:20:23,280
Alone?

350
00:20:23,280 --> 00:20:25,280
It's like a mochi.

351
00:20:25,280 --> 00:20:26,280
I'm alone.

352
00:20:26,280 --> 00:20:28,280
You're thinking now, aren't you?

353
00:20:28,280 --> 00:20:30,280
It's a little different.

354
00:20:30,280 --> 00:20:32,280
I don't decide.

355
00:20:32,280 --> 00:20:34,280
I want you to imagine it.

356
00:20:34,280 --> 00:20:36,280
There is no theme.

357
00:20:36,280 --> 00:20:37,280
I see.

358
00:20:37,280 --> 00:20:22,040
It's a

359
00:20:40,280 --> 00:20:22,040
The theme of HIROTA's work is a

360
00:20:22,040 --> 00:20:28,040
A picture with a story.

361
00:20:28,040 --> 00:20:30,040
I can't see your face.

362
00:20:30,040 --> 00:20:32,040
I'm talking on my back.

363
00:20:32,040 --> 00:20:34,040
It's a cute picture.

364
00:20:34,040 --> 00:20:36,040
I'm alone.

365
00:20:36,040 --> 00:20:38,040
I'm alone.

366
00:20:38,040 --> 00:20:40,040
I'm thinking now, aren't you?

367
00:20:40,040 --> 00:20:42,040
I don't decide.

368
00:20:42,040 --> 00:20:46,040
I want you to imagine it.

369
00:20:46,040 --> 00:20:48,040
There is no theme.

370
00:20:48,040 --> 00:20:48,240
I see.

371
00:20:48,240 --> 00:20:51,240
Let's watch Hiro's work.

372
00:20:52,320 --> 00:20:54,320
What's this color?

373
00:20:54,320 --> 00:20:56,320
It's nice.

374
00:20:56,320 --> 00:20:58,320
What's in your hand?

375
00:20:58,320 --> 00:21:00,320
It's a letter.

376
00:21:00,320 --> 00:21:02,320
It's a letter set.

377
00:21:02,320 --> 00:21:06,320
The color of the letter set is cute, so
the background is cute.

378
00:21:06,320 --> 00:21:12,320
I want to use it, so I took off my cape.

379
00:21:12,320 --> 00:21:14,320
We took pictures with all our cape off.

380
00:21:14,320 --> 00:21:16,320
That's the way you're going to do it.

381
00:21:16,320 --> 00:21:18,320
I want to use the color.

382
00:21:18,320 --> 00:21:24,320
But if you make the face more vivid, it
turns yellow.

383
00:21:24,320 --> 00:21:28,320
That's difficult, but I think it's a
good idea.

384
00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:30,320
I see.

385
00:21:30,320 --> 00:21:32,320
Can I take off my cape?

386
00:21:32,320 --> 00:21:34,320
I don't know.

387
00:21:34,320 --> 00:21:36,320
I took it off in one shot.

388
00:21:36,320 --> 00:21:38,320
I took it off in one minute.

389
00:21:38,320 --> 00:21:40,320
I used it as a reference.

390
00:21:40,320 --> 00:21:42,320
I see.

391
00:21:42,320 --> 00:21:44,320
You used it as a reference.

392
00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:46,320
That's great.

393
00:21:46,320 --> 00:21:48,320
What's the meaning of the title?

394
00:21:48,320 --> 00:21:50,320
It's a theme art.

395
00:21:50,320 --> 00:21:52,320
I don't know.

396
00:21:52,320 --> 00:21:54,320
It's a window art.

397
00:21:54,320 --> 00:21:56,320
It's a window art.

398
00:21:56,320 --> 00:21:58,320
It's a little lame.

399
00:21:58,320 --> 00:22:00,320
It's lame.

400
00:22:00,320 --> 00:22:02,320
I'll use it as a reference.

401
00:22:02,320 --> 00:22:04,320
Can I use it again?

402
00:22:04,320 --> 00:22:06,320
If someone else has a good one, please
use it.

403
00:22:06,320 --> 00:22:08,320
It's a window art.

404
00:22:08,320 --> 00:22:10,320
What's the meaning of the title?

405
00:22:10,320 --> 00:22:12,320
The theme of Hoshina is a window art.

406
00:22:12,320 --> 00:22:16,320
What's the meaning of the title?

407
00:22:16,320 --> 00:22:18,320
Let's take a look.

408
00:22:18,320 --> 00:22:20,320
This is it.

409
00:22:20,320 --> 00:22:22,522
Thank you.

410
00:22:22,522 --> 00:22:24,522
I see

411
00:22:26,522 --> 00:22:31,522
From the window, I can see two faces

412
00:22:31,522 --> 00:22:39,522
I wanted to make the eyes stand out, so
I made the back a little blurry

413
00:22:41,522 --> 00:22:42,522
What are you going to do, Chiyo?

414
00:22:42,522 --> 00:22:43,522
I've decided

415
00:22:44,522 --> 00:22:45,522
Window art

416
00:22:46,522 --> 00:22:49,522
Congratulations, you've officially
adopted it

417
00:22:49,522 --> 00:22:52,522
Then, window art

418
00:22:52,522 --> 00:22:54,522
Ebichu photo contest

419
00:22:54,522 --> 00:22:57,522
Photos taken by the members

420
00:22:57,522 --> 00:22:53,002
Finally, the work of the professional is
decided by the

421
00:22:53,002 --> 00:23:03,522
final evaluation by the professional

422
00:23:03,522 --> 00:23:07,522
Who will be the member who will be
honored?

423
00:23:08,522 --> 00:23:10,522
I would like to announce

424
00:23:11,522 --> 00:23:12,522
The first place is

425
00:23:12,522 --> 00:23:18,522
Mayabasa

426
00:23:20,602 --> 00:23:26,602
Teacher, I want to say that the soft
light of the shoulder is beautiful

427
00:23:28,602 --> 00:23:30,602
Teacher, you look at different places

428
00:23:30,602 --> 00:23:33,602
I look at the position of the light

429
00:23:33,602 --> 00:23:36,602
It's now position, how is it, Mayama-
san?

430
00:23:36,602 --> 00:23:41,602
Personally, I want to go to Kyoto with a
camera

431
00:23:41,602 --> 00:23:44,602
You want to go to Kyoto? That's good, a
tourist attraction

432
00:23:44,602 --> 00:23:46,602
It's a really good picture

433
00:23:46,602 --> 00:23:47,602
That's good

434
00:23:47,602 --> 00:23:50,602
Now, how is it, Matsuno-san?

435
00:23:50,602 --> 00:23:52,602
I'm very happy

436
00:23:52,602 --> 00:23:54,602
It's overflowing

437
00:23:54,602 --> 00:23:58,602
It looks like a different person through
the photo

438
00:23:58,602 --> 00:24:00,602
Is it the same person?

439
00:24:00,602 --> 00:24:02,602
Is it the same person?

440
00:24:02,602 --> 00:24:04,602
It's the same person

441
00:24:04,602 --> 00:24:06,602
Matsuno-san, you are always in a good
mood

442
00:24:06,602 --> 00:24:08,602
I was given a smile

443
00:24:08,602 --> 00:24:10,602
Kyoto was a good photo

444
00:24:10,602 --> 00:24:12,602
That's right, it was surprisingly good

445
00:24:12,602 --> 00:24:14,602
I was surprised

446
00:24:14,602 --> 00:24:17,602
Mayama won the prize

447
00:24:17,602 --> 00:24:20,602
We will give you the prize camera

448
00:24:20,602 --> 00:24:22,602
Thank you

449
00:24:22,602 --> 00:24:26,128
Thank you

450
00:24:26,128 --> 00:24:31,128
So, Hirota, please say something to end
this episode

451
00:24:32,128 --> 00:24:35,128
I'm glad that everyone is having fun

452
00:24:36,128 --> 00:24:39,128
See you next week! Bye!

453
00:24:41,128 --> 00:24:44,128
Next episode of Ebichu Tastas

454
00:24:44,128 --> 00:24:46,128
It's been a year since we last saw
Tastas

455
00:24:46,128 --> 00:24:48,128
That's fast

456
00:24:48,128 --> 00:24:50,128
It's almost the 1st anniversary

457
00:24:50,128 --> 00:24:52,128
Ebichu is talking seriously

458
00:24:52,128 --> 00:24:57,128
It wasn't like everyone is talking about
their future

459
00:24:57,128 --> 00:25:00,128
I think we can do something difficult

460
00:25:00,128 --> 00:25:03,128
The three of us are looking forward to
it

461
00:25:04,128 --> 00:25:07,128
Ebichu talks about the future

462
00:25:07,128 --> 00:25:11,168
Ebichu Tastas will be back!

463
00:25:11,168 --> 00:25:17,168
This program was brought to you by the
sponsor.

464
00:25:17,168 --> 00:25:19,168
What was your wish?

465
00:25:19,168 --> 00:25:31,718
I had a lot of misunderstandings and
thoughts.
