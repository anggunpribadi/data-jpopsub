[Verification] Will I be able to pass if I am seriously looking for a job at a local company? ? [Iginari Tohoku product]

Do you know how to write a proper resume and how to get an interview?
We will teach you that!
If you have a lot of experience, you can afford job hunting, right?

By the way, it's a new costume from this time.
*Short conte "16-minute non-short conte job hunting".

Scheduled to premiere every Monday from 20:00! Members will also participate in the chat!
