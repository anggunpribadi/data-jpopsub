1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
The two people who joined the other day
are 15 years old now, so they're 10
years old.

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:11,000
You were so young when you were 15.

3
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:15,000
And then I told everyone that I was a
monster.

4
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:18,000
I'm going to secure a monster car.

5
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,000
You're going to be so active.

6
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,000
It's pretty rough.

7
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:25,040
I'm going to get a monster car when I'm
16.

8
00:00:25,040 --> 00:00:27,040
I like it, but it's a pain in the ass.

9
00:00:27,040 --> 00:00:29,040
But I like it.

10
00:00:29,040 --> 00:00:25,040
The

11
00:00:25,040 --> 00:00:34,000
I like it, but it's a pain in the ass.

12
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:40,000
Hello, I'm Viva Form Warre, the cute-
looking Yakan-kun of Stardust.

13
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:48,000
Today, the most beautiful girl came to
Yakan-kun.

14
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:51,000
Let's call today's guest.

15
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:54,000
This is idol.

16
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:58,000
I'm Mirai Hoshino, the lead role of the
series, and I'm a lucky seven.

17
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Nice to meet you.

18
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,000
Good morning.

19
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,000
I'm nervous.

20
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:07,000
Mirai-chan came.

21
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:10,000
I'm not nervous at all.

22
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
It's been a while.

23
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
It's been a while.

24
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:17,000
I was nervous in the morning.

25
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:20,000
I'm sorry to say that I'm talking to you
from the morning.

26
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
I think it's a job that's not easy.

27
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
Thank you.

28
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:29,000
You're busy with a lot of things, aren't
you?

29
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:32,000
Yes, it's a time when a lot of things
are changing.

30
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:35,000
I joined the two members.

31
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:39,000
Hina Kashiwagi graduated from Matsu this
year.

32
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:42,000
I've been doing a lot of work.

33
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:48,000
In the midst of that, Mirai-chan is
already in a position of immorality.

34
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
I don't know.

35
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
How far are you from the bottom?

36
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
I'm 10 steps away.

37
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:59,000
I didn't think I'd be working with
someone who's 10 steps away.

38
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,000
That's right.

39
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
I'm going to do it with you.

40
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:10,000
I was watching a lot of things on SNS.

41
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:14,000
But more than that, you've done 10 more.

42
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Yes.

43
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,000
How did you talk?

44
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:23,000
The first thing that surprised me was
that I joined the three of us last year.

45
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,000
That's right.

46
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,000
In 2021.

47
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:28,000
Yes, we were doing it alone.

48
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:32,000
Unfortunately, the first announcement
was during the corona.

49
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:35,000
I announced it at a live show.

50
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:41,000
What they did first was not to take
pictures.

51
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:44,000
They checked if it was in the trend.

52
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:49,000
They checked if their name was in the
trend.

53
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,000
Aren't you surprised?

54
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,000
I'm surprised.

55
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:57,000
Normally, I'd be happy to take a picture
when it's over.

56
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:04,000
I think it's the same for you, but we've
been doing it like that.

57
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:07,000
I'm surprised.

58
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:10,000
You were a scout, right?

59
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:13,000
Yes, I joined the team as a scout.

60
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:18,000
I joined in November 2009.

61
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:21,000
I joined in May the following year.

62
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:24,000
You joined in the middle of the year.

63
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:28,000
It's been 13 years since you joined the
team.

64
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
I've been doing it for 3 or 4 years.

65
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:33,000
Then you finally wanted to do 10.

66
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:38,000
The two of us who joined the other day
are 15 years old now.

67
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
10 times.

68
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:44,000
You were 15 years old at the time.

69
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
You were a very adult.

70
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:49,000
You were a senior in the first and
second year of high school.

71
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:52,000
You were an adult.

72
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
That's right.

73
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:57,000
I think there are many things.

74
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:00,864
It's very thoughtful.

75
00:04:00,864 --> 00:04:03,864
I'm not going to stop.

76
00:04:03,864 --> 00:04:05,864
I'm going to hold it down because I'm
alone.

77
00:04:05,864 --> 00:04:06,864
I see.

78
00:04:06,864 --> 00:04:08,864
I'm going to live without knowing it.

79
00:04:08,864 --> 00:04:10,864
I'll eat the apple.

80
00:04:10,864 --> 00:04:11,864
I'm a monster.

81
00:04:11,864 --> 00:04:12,864
You're a monster.

82
00:04:12,864 --> 00:04:14,864
You're a monster in many ways.

83
00:04:14,864 --> 00:04:17,864
I'm hiding before the monster comes.

84
00:04:17,864 --> 00:04:20,864
I'm going to secure it before the
monster comes.

85
00:04:20,864 --> 00:04:30,864
This program is Ren-san.

86
00:04:31,232 --> 00:04:33,232
Masa-san

87
00:04:34,232 --> 00:04:36,232
Nanana-san

88
00:04:38,232 --> 00:04:40,232
Osomekko-san

89
00:04:41,232 --> 00:04:45,232
We sent it by the support of Hageon-san.

90
00:04:45,232 --> 00:04:52,461
Thank you everyone!
