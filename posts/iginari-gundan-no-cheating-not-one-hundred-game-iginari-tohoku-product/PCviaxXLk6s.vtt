00:00.000 --> 00:02.000
 Thank you for watching!

00:03.034 --> 00:05.034
 Good morning.

00:05.034 --> 00:07.034
 It's not that.

00:07.034 --> 00:09.034
 It's not that.

00:09.034 --> 00:11.034
 It's a promise.

00:11.034 --> 00:13.034
 I'm tired of saying that.

00:13.034 --> 00:15.034
 Let's practice.

00:15.034 --> 00:17.034
 I'm in charge of betrayal.

00:17.034 --> 00:19.034
 You are.

00:19.034 --> 00:21.034
 I'm in charge of betrayal.

00:21.034 --> 00:23.034
 I'm in charge of betrayal.

00:23.034 --> 00:25.034
 I can only say one word.

00:27.034 --> 00:29.034
 Today,

00:29.034 --> 00:31.034
 we played

00:31.034 --> 00:33.034
 a game of betrayal.

00:33.034 --> 00:35.034
 I'm in charge of betrayal.

00:35.034 --> 00:37.034
 The rule is

00:39.034 --> 00:41.034
 the one who says 100 words will lose.

00:41.034 --> 00:43.034
 Each person will say

00:43.034 --> 00:45.034
 3 words.

00:45.034 --> 00:47.034
 The one who says 100 words

00:47.034 --> 00:49.034
 will lose.

00:49.034 --> 00:51.034
 I see.

00:51.034 --> 00:53.034
 It's not good to end the game

00:53.034 --> 00:55.034
 by saying 100 words.

00:55.034 --> 00:57.034
 I prepared Umeboshi and lemon juice.

00:57.034 --> 00:59.034
 I see.

00:59.034 --> 01:01.034
 The number of times you say the number

01:01.034 --> 01:03.034
 will be the number of times

01:03.034 --> 01:05.034
 you put lemon juice on Umeboshi.

01:07.034 --> 01:09.034
 The last person to say 100 words

01:09.034 --> 01:11.034
 will eat Umeboshi.

01:11.034 --> 01:13.034
 I see.

01:13.034 --> 01:15.034
 Why are you happy?

01:15.034 --> 01:17.034
 I didn't hear that.

01:17.034 --> 01:19.034
 I see.

01:19.034 --> 01:21.034
 For example,

01:21.034 --> 01:23.034
 what are you doing?

01:23.034 --> 01:25.034
 Are you ready?

01:25.034 --> 01:29.034
 Yes.

01:29.034 --> 01:31.034
 The one who plays rock-paper-scissors

01:31.034 --> 01:33.034
 will say 100 words.

01:33.034 --> 01:35.034
 Look at the screen.

01:35.034 --> 01:37.034
 This way?

01:39.034 --> 01:41.034
 Let's play rock-paper-scissors.

01:41.034 --> 01:43.034
 I'll say G.

01:43.034 --> 01:45.034
 I'll say C.

01:45.034 --> 01:47.034
 I'll say P.

01:47.034 --> 01:49.034
 I'll say F.

01:49.034 --> 01:51.034
 I'll say H.

01:51.034 --> 01:53.034
 I'll say J.

01:53.034 --> 01:55.034
 I'll say M.

01:55.034 --> 01:57.034
 I'll say Q.

01:57.034 --> 01:59.034
 I'll say Q.

01:59.034 --> 02:01.034
 I'll say Q.

02:01.034 --> 02:03.034
 I'll say Q.

02:05.034 --> 02:07.034
 She's attacking directly.

02:09.034 --> 02:11.034
 She's fast.

02:11.034 --> 02:13.034
 I'll say 7.

02:13.034 --> 02:15.034
 I'll say 8.

02:15.034 --> 02:17.034
 I'll say 9.

02:17.034 --> 02:19.034
 I'll say 10.

02:19.034 --> 02:21.034
 I'll say 10.

02:21.034 --> 02:23.034
 She's not nervous.

02:23.034 --> 02:25.034
 She's too fast.

02:25.034 --> 02:27.034
 I'll say 14, 15, 16.

02:27.034 --> 02:29.034
 Go for it!

02:29.034 --> 02:31.034
 I'll say 16.

02:31.034 --> 02:33.034
 I'll say 17.

02:33.034 --> 02:35.034
 I'll say 18.

02:35.034 --> 02:37.034
 I'll say 20.

02:37.034 --> 02:39.034
 You said 4.

02:39.034 --> 02:41.034
 I'll say 21, 22, 23.

02:41.034 --> 02:43.034
 I'll say 23.

02:43.034 --> 02:45.034
 I'm sorry.

02:45.034 --> 02:49.034
 I'll say 24, 25, 26.

02:49.034 --> 02:51.034
 This is fun.

02:51.034 --> 02:55.034
 I'll say 27, 28, 29, 30.

02:55.034 --> 02:57.034
 I'll say 31, 32, 33.

02:57.034 --> 03:01.034
 I'll say 34, 35, 36.

03:01.034 --> 03:03.034
 She's cute.

03:03.034 --> 03:07.034
 I'll say 37, 38, 39.

03:07.034 --> 03:09.034
 She's been like this.

03:09.034 --> 03:11.034
 Which one did you say?

03:11.034 --> 03:14.034
 I'll say 37, 38, 39.

03:14.034 --> 03:17.034
 No, 41.

03:17.034 --> 03:19.034
 I'll say 42.

03:19.034 --> 03:21.034
 She's talking.

03:21.034 --> 03:23.034
 No, I'm not.

03:23.034 --> 03:25.034
 How far did you say?

03:25.034 --> 03:27.034
 I'll say 45.

03:27.034 --> 03:31.034

03:41.034 --> 03:43.034
 I'll say 50.

03:43.034 --> 03:45.034
 I'll say 51.

03:45.034 --> 03:47.034
 She's a good woman.

03:49.034 --> 03:51.034
 She said 53.

03:51.034 --> 03:53.034
 I'll say 53.

03:53.034 --> 03:55.034
 She said 53.

03:55.034 --> 03:59.034
 I'll say 54, 55.

03:59.034 --> 04:01.034
 Why did you say that?

04:01.034 --> 04:03.034
 I'll say 56, 57, 58.

04:03.034 --> 04:07.034
 I'll say 59.

04:09.034 --> 04:11.034
 I'll say 60.

04:11.034 --> 04:15.034
 I'll say 62, 63, 64, 65, 66, 67, 68.

04:15.034 --> 04:17.034
 What are you doing?

04:17.034 --> 04:25.034
 I'll say 69, 70, 71, 73, 74, 75.

04:25.034 --> 04:33.034
 I'll say 76, 79, 80, 81, 82, 83.

04:33.034 --> 04:35.034
 I'll say 84, 85, 86, 87.

04:35.034 --> 04:37.034
 I'm getting confused.

04:37.034 --> 04:41.034
 I'll say 88, 89, 91, 92.

04:41.034 --> 04:45.034
 I'm getting confused.

04:45.034 --> 04:49.034
 I'll say 95, 96, 97, 98.

04:49.034 --> 04:51.034
 Who are you feeding this to?

04:51.034 --> 04:53.034
 I'm a guardian.

04:53.034 --> 04:55.034
 I'm a power girl.

04:55.034 --> 04:57.034
 You don't do that.

04:57.034 --> 04:59.034
 I'm sorry.

04:59.034 --> 05:01.034
 It's hard to do.

05:01.034 --> 05:03.034
 I'll say 98.

05:03.034 --> 05:05.034
 I'll say 100.

05:05.034 --> 05:07.034
 I'm sorry.

05:07.034 --> 05:09.034
 I'll say 99.

05:09.034 --> 05:11.034
 I'll say 99.1.

05:11.034 --> 05:13.034
 I'm sorry.

05:13.034 --> 05:15.034
 You're kind.

05:17.034 --> 05:19.034
 I'll say 100.

05:19.034 --> 05:21.034
 I'll say 100.

05:21.034 --> 05:23.034
 She said 100.

05:23.034 --> 05:27.034
 Thank you.

05:27.034 --> 05:29.034
 Thank you so much.

05:29.034 --> 05:31.034
 Thank you.

05:31.034 --> 05:33.034
 I'll eat this.

05:33.034 --> 05:35.034
 I'll eat this first.

05:38.528 --> 05:42.528
 It's a good thing.

05:42.528 --> 05:44.528
 It's delicious.

05:44.528 --> 05:47.528
 I really like this.

05:47.528 --> 05:50.528
 Oh, it's not sour at all.

05:50.528 --> 05:51.528
 Oh, really?

05:51.528 --> 05:54.528
 Then, the next umeboshi is a little
open.

05:54.528 --> 05:55.528
 I see.

05:55.528 --> 05:57.528
 Direct assas

05:57.528 --> 06:00.864
 Thank you for watching.

06:00.864 --> 06:03.024
 Fukase There are

06:03.724 --> 06:05.104
 some parts where the

06:05.104 --> 06:11.224
 guy didn't work, so

06:11.224 --> 06:16.564
 it may be sour if I say Japanese
cucumbers.

06:16.564 --> 06:20.964
 Certainly I'm from

06:20.964 --> 06:24.704
 Shimizu Everyone

07:44.508 --> 07:45.508
 Nice, Dandy

07:45.508 --> 07:47.308
 You said it yourself

07:47.308 --> 07:48.308
 56

07:48.308 --> 07:49.308
 57

07:49.308 --> 07:50.308

07:53.308 --> 07:54.308
 62

07:54.308 --> 07:55.308

07:55.308 --> 07:56.308

07:56.308 --> 07:57.308

08:02.208 --> 08:03.208

08:03.208 --> 08:04.208

08:04.208 --> 08:05.208

 87

08:13.208 --> 08:14.000
 88

08:14.000 --> 08:15.920
 Let's go.

08:15.920 --> 08:17.920
 It's a

08:17.920 --> 08:19.920
 good

08:19.920 --> 08:21.920
 feeling, but it's a

08:21.920 --> 08:23.920
 good feeling, isn't it?

08:23.920 --> 08:25.920
 828

08:25.920 --> 08:27.920
 9

08:27.920 --> 08:29.920
 8

08:29.920 --> 08:31.920
 6

08:31.920 --> 08:33.920
 8

08:33.920 --> 08:35.920
 9

08:35.920 --> 08:37.920
 9

08:37.920 --> 08:39.920
 9

08:39.920 --> 08:41.920
 9

08:41.920 --> 08:43.920
 9

08:43.920 --> 08:45.920
 6

08:45.920 --> 08:47.920
 9

08:47.920 --> 08:49.920
 9

08:49.920 --> 08:51.920
 9

08:51.920 --> 08:53.920
 9

08:53.920 --> 08:55.920
 9

08:55.920 --> 08:57.920
 9

08:57.920 --> 08:59.920
 9

08:59.920 --> 09:01.920
 9

09:01.920 --> 09:03.920
 9

09:03.920 --> 09:05.920
 9

09:05.920 --> 09:07.920
 9

09:07.920 --> 09:09.920
 9

09:09.920 --> 09:11.920
 9

09:11.920 --> 09:13.920
 9

09:13.920 --> 09:15.920
 9

09:15.920 --> 09:17.920
 9

09:17.920 --> 09:19.920
 9

09:19.920 --> 09:21.920
 9

09:21.920 --> 09:22.848
 9

09:22.848 --> 09:24.848
 98 times.

09:24.848 --> 09:26.848
 98 times?

09:26.848 --> 09:28.848
 98 times?

09:28.848 --> 09:30.848
 So, Miyu will put it twice and eat it.

09:30.848 --> 09:32.848
 Or, I will put it in the microwave.

09:32.848 --> 09:34.848
 Or, everyone will eat it.

09:34.848 --> 09:36.848
 That's right.

09:36.848 --> 09:38.848
 You can put it once and then think
about it.

09:38.848 --> 09:40.848
 Yes.

09:40.848 --> 09:42.800
 Thank you.

09:43.800 --> 09:45.800
 Close your eyes.

09:45.800 --> 09:47.800
 Open your eyes in 3 seconds.

09:47.800 --> 09:49.800
 Put your eyes in front of yourself or
Ren.

09:49.800 --> 09:51.800
 3 seconds.

09:52.800 --> 09:54.800
 It depends on which one you choose.

09:54.800 --> 09:56.800
 You can choose the one you like.

10:03.800 --> 10:05.800
 Thank you.

10:06.800 --> 10:08.800
 Thank you.

10:08.800 --> 10:09.808
 It's OK.

10:10.808 --> 10:12.808
 It's sour.

10:13.808 --> 10:15.808
 It's not sour.

10:16.808 --> 10:18.808
 It's sour.

10:19.808 --> 10:21.808
 It's sour.

10:21.808 --> 10:23.808
 I wanted to drink this.

10:24.808 --> 10:26.808
 Next, put sugar in pancakes.

10:27.808 --> 10:29.808
 Sugar?

10:30.808 --> 10:31.808
 The answer is...

10:31.808 --> 10:33.680
 It's sour.

10:34.680 --> 10:36.680
 Now, you've got the answer.

10:38.680 --> 10:40.680
 What should we do?

10:40.680 --> 10:42.680
 Let's play rock-paper-scissors.

10:42.680 --> 10:45.680
 We've started the game, haven't we?

10:45.680 --> 10:47.680
 Let's change the order of the seats.

10:47.680 --> 10:49.680
 Let's change the order of the seats.

10:49.680 --> 10:51.680
 First, let's go with the lower one.

10:51.680 --> 10:54.680
 That's not the lower one!

10:54.680 --> 10:57.680
 I said the lower one.

10:58.680 --> 11:00.680
 1.

11:00.680 --> 11:02.680
 I can write it down three times.

11:02.680 --> 11:04.680
 I thought I could write it down only
100 times.

11:04.680 --> 11:06.680
 You're good at writing.

11:07.680 --> 11:08.680
 It's cute.

11:08.680 --> 11:11.680
 It looks cute, but it's not.

11:11.680 --> 11:13.680
 5

11:13.680 --> 11:15.680
 6

11:15.680 --> 11:17.680
 8

11:17.680 --> 11:18.680
 9

11:18.680 --> 11:19.680
 10

11:19.680 --> 11:20.680
 What?

11:20.680 --> 11:22.680
 What's this?

11:22.680 --> 11:23.680
 It's buried.

11:23.680 --> 11:24.680
 12

11:24.680 --> 11:25.680
 13

11:25.680 --> 11:26.680
 14

11:26.680 --> 11:27.680
 I can't see it anymore.

11:27.680 --> 11:29.680
 15

11:29.680 --> 11:30.680
 16

11:30.680 --> 11:31.680
 17

11:31.680 --> 11:32.680
 18

11:32.680 --> 11:33.680
 What?

11:33.680 --> 11:34.680
 I said 15.

11:34.680 --> 11:35.680
 16

11:35.680 --> 11:36.680
 18

11:36.680 --> 11:37.680
 I said 18.

11:37.680 --> 11:38.680
 Sorry.

11:38.680 --> 11:39.680
 I said 19.

11:39.680 --> 11:40.680
 Did you say it four times?

11:40.680 --> 11:41.680
 15

11:41.680 --> 11:42.680
 16

11:42.680 --> 11:43.408
 17

11:44.408 --> 11:46.408
 20 21 20

11:47.408 --> 11:50.408
 23 24 25

11:51.408 --> 11:54.408
 26 27 28

11:55.408 --> 11:56.408
 You are blinding me

11:56.408 --> 12:02.408
 29 30 31 32

12:03.912 --> 12:06.912
 34 35 36

12:07.912 --> 12:08.912
 In Mabuse style

12:09.912 --> 12:10.912
 31 39

12:11.912 --> 12:12.912
 What do you want to do in winter?

12:13.912 --> 12:16.912
 40 42

12:17.912 --> 12:18.912
 I'm full

12:19.912 --> 12:20.912
 I'm full

12:20.912 --> 12:23.912
 Please subscribe to my channel!

12:25.320 --> 12:27.320
 I want to read and compare.

12:27.320 --> 12:28.320
 I want to read and compare.

12:28.320 --> 12:30.320
 Let's read the normal one.

12:30.320 --> 12:31.320
 45? 46?

12:31.320 --> 12:32.320
 45? 46?

12:32.320 --> 12:33.320
 45? 46?

12:33.320 --> 12:34.320
 45? 46?

12:34.320 --> 12:35.034
 Thank you for watching!

12:35.034 --> 12:37.754
 49 50

12:37.754 --> 12:41.594
 51 What do you do with this?

12:41.594 --> 12:43.434
 What do you do with this?

12:43.434 --> 12:47.434
 You can cooperate with everyone and
reduce the number of people who can eat
it.

12:47.434 --> 12:48.874
 Ah, that's right.

12:48.874 --> 12:53.434
 But I don't eat it myself, so I'm going
to eat it.

12:53.434 --> 12:55.434
 I'm going to eat it.

12:55.434 --> 12:57.434
 50

12:57.434 --> 12:59.034
 14

12:59.034 --> 13:00.314
 55

13:00.314 --> 13:01.674
 56

13:01.674 --> 13:03.674
 Does it make sense to write?

13:03.674 --> 13:05.674
 58

13:05.674 --> 13:07.674
 59

13:07.674 --> 13:09.674
 I didn't know that all the bags were
here.

13:09.674 --> 13:13.674
 I'm just transferring sugar now.

13:13.674 --> 13:15.674
 64

13:15.674 --> 13:17.674
 I can't see it.

13:17.674 --> 13:19.674
 Pancake

13:19.674 --> 13:21.674
 66

13:21.674 --> 13:23.674
 67

13:23.674 --> 13:25.674
 60

13:25.674 --> 13:27.674
 70

13:27.674 --> 13:29.674
 I entered

13:29.674 --> 13:31.674
 71

13:31.674 --> 13:33.674
 I'm going to die.

13:33.674 --> 13:35.674
 It's a sugar that's good for your
health.

13:35.674 --> 13:37.674
 It's good for your body.

13:37.674 --> 13:39.674
 74

13:39.674 --> 13:41.674
 75

13:41.674 --> 13:43.674
 Please

13:43.674 --> 13:45.674
 66

13:45.674 --> 13:47.674
 77

13:47.674 --> 13:49.674
 78

13:49.674 --> 13:51.674
 79

13:51.674 --> 13:53.674
 80

13:53.674 --> 13:55.674
 80

13:55.674 --> 13:57.674
 81

13:57.674 --> 13:59.674
 81

13:59.674 --> 14:01.674
 I don't like it.

14:01.674 --> 14:03.674
 I like it.

14:03.674 --> 14:05.674
 85

14:05.674 --> 14:07.674
 86

14:07.674 --> 14:09.674
 87

14:09.674 --> 14:11.674
 87

14:11.674 --> 14:13.674
 80

14:13.674 --> 14:15.376
 80

14:16.376 --> 14:17.376
 Don't count.

14:19.376 --> 14:20.376
 91

14:20.376 --> 14:21.376
 92

14:23.376 --> 14:24.376
 I'm thinking.

14:25.376 --> 14:27.376
 I don't know the answer.

14:27.376 --> 14:28.376
 92

14:29.376 --> 14:30.376
 93

14:30.376 --> 14:31.376
 Wait, 94

14:33.376 --> 14:34.376
 95

14:34.376 --> 14:35.376
 96

14:36.376 --> 14:37.376
 97

14:38.376 --> 14:39.376
 98

14:39.376 --> 14:40.376
 97

14:44.384 --> 14:46.384
 9 o'clock.

14:46.384 --> 14:48.384
 Start with 9.

14:48.384 --> 14:50.384
 9!

14:50.384 --> 14:52.384
 Let's gather them.

14:52.384 --> 14:54.384
 Wait.

14:54.384 --> 14:56.384
 What's wrong with you?

14:56.384 --> 14:58.384
 Please.

14:58.384 --> 15:00.384
 What's wrong with you?

15:00.384 --> 15:02.384
 Excuse me.

15:02.384 --> 15:04.384
 9!

15:04.384 --> 15:06.384
 100.

15:06.384 --> 15:12.384
 Really?

15:13.722 --> 15:14.722
 Yeah,

15:15.642 --> 15:17.642
 no,

15:17.882 --> 15:20.762
 space bubbles have entered.

15:21.742 --> 15:24.702
 I'm

15:24.702 --> 15:26.302
 sorry about

15:26.762 --> 15:29.762
 this.

15:29.762 --> 15:31.142
 go

15:31.142 --> 15:33.862
 I'm sorry.

15:33.862 --> 15:36.862
 I'm sorry.

15:36.862 --> 15:38.862
 I'm sorry.

15:38.862 --> 15:40.862
 I'm sorry.

15:40.862 --> 15:42.862
 I'm sorry.

15:42.862 --> 15:44.862
 I'm sorry.

15:44.862 --> 15:46.862
 It's okay.

15:46.862 --> 15:48.862
 You don't have to eat it.

15:48.862 --> 15:50.862
 Are you okay?

15:50.862 --> 15:55.840
 It looks delicious.

15:56.840 --> 15:57.840
 It's sweet!

15:59.840 --> 16:00.840
 Did you eat a plum?

16:02.840 --> 16:03.840
 It's too late to say good-bye.

16:04.840 --> 16:06.840
 Pancake is made of sugar.

16:09.840 --> 16:10.840
 I still have sugar.

16:12.840 --> 16:14.840
 Which one is stronger? Sour or sweet?

16:16.840 --> 16:17.840
 What is this?

16:17.840 --> 16:18.840
 It's syrup.

16:18.840 --> 16:19.840
 It's like snow.

16:19.840 --> 16:20.840
 It's shaved ice.

16:20.840 --> 16:21.840
 Shaved ice?

16:21.840 --> 16:22.840
 Which one is stronger?

16:22.840 --> 16:23.840
 I think so, too.

16:27.866 --> 16:28.866
 bloom!

16:30.512 --> 16:32.512
 Oh, they're fighting.

16:34.512 --> 16:36.512
 Ah, it's sour.

16:37.512 --> 16:38.512
 But it's sweet.

16:38.512 --> 16:39.512
 It's sour.

16:40.512 --> 16:41.512
 It's sour.

16:42.512 --> 16:43.512
 Give me more tea.

16:44.512 --> 16:45.512
 Give me more tea.

16:45.512 --> 16:46.512
 It's Tachibana Goroku.

16:47.512 --> 16:48.512
 Do you need more tea?

16:48.512 --> 16:49.512
 That's water.

16:49.512 --> 16:50.512
 That's not water.

16:51.512 --> 16:52.512
 That's not water.

16:52.512 --> 16:53.512
 But...

16:53.512 --> 17:00.512
 The conclusion of today's Not 100 Games
is that sour is stronger.

17:00.512 --> 17:01.512
 The conclusion.

17:02.512 --> 17:03.512
 Anna, do your best.

17:04.512 --> 17:05.512
 Sour.

17:05.512 --> 17:07.512
 Sour won.

17:07.512 --> 17:08.976
 Please subscribe to this channel.

17:08.976 --> 17:10.976
 Thank you for watching!

17:10.976 --> 17:12.976
 Please look forward to next week!

17:12.976 --> 17:14.976
 Bye!

17:14.976 --> 17:16.976
 Sour! Sour!

17:16.976 --> 17:26.976
 Please look forward to next week!
