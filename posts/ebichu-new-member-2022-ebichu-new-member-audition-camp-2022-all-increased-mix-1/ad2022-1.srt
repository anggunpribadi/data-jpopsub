00:01:14,378 --> 00:01:26,378

10
00:01:26,378 --> 00:01:27,378
I want to be an idol

11
00:01:27,378 --> 00:01:29,378
I want to be an idol

12
00:01:29,378 --> 00:01:34,378
I will definitely become an idol member

13
00:01:34,378 --> 00:01:40,378
I don't want to be an idol, I want to be
an idol member

14
00:01:40,378 --> 00:01:44,378
Who will be able to achieve their dream?

15
00:02:02,330 --> 00:02:07,030
The bus with the entrance exam students
arrived at the training ground.

16
00:02:09,130 --> 00:02:11,030
The first student is...

00:02:11,030 --> 00:02:12,030
Thank you.

18
00:02:12,030 --> 00:02:13,330
Thank you.

19
00:02:14,530 --> 00:02:16,830
I'm a student in the swimming class.

20
00:02:16,830 --> 00:02:20,330
I've been doing swimming since I was in
the fifth grade.

21
00:02:20,330 --> 00:02:24,314
I've been doing piano since I was four
years old.

22
00:02:24,314 --> 00:02:30,314
Yuka from Tokyo, 16 years old, who
specializes in fruit

23
00:02:32,314 --> 00:02:36,314
I want to dance as hard as I can, and do
my best

24
00:02:36,314 --> 00:02:41,314

00:03:00,314 --> 00:03:03,314
I want to dance as hard as I can

30
00:03:04,314 --> 00:03:08,314
I really wanted to be in the group

31
00:03:08,314 --> 00:03:11,314
I watched the last year's concert

32
00:03:11,314 --> 00:03:17,314
I thought it would be fun to be in the
group

33
00:03:17,314 --> 00:03:21,314
I've come this far, so I want to do my
best

34
00:03:21,314 --> 00:03:24,314
I want to give my best

35
00:03:24,314 --> 00:03:26,314
The next student is...

00:03:36,314 --> 00:03:40,314
The youngest of the students who are
challenging for the final evaluation

38
00:03:40,314 --> 00:03:46,314
I want to be able to support everyone in
terms of age

39
00:03:46,314 --> 00:03:50,314
I want to be able to support everyone in
terms of age

40
00:03:50,314 --> 00:03:54,314
I'm not good at dancing

41
00:03:54,314 --> 00:03:57,314
I'm not good at singing

42
00:03:57,314 --> 00:04:00,314
I want to try my best

43
00:04:01,314 --> 00:04:03,314
The next student is...

44
00:04:03,314 --> 00:04:04,314
What grade are you in middle school?

45
00:04:04,314 --> 00:04:06,314
I'm in the second grade

46
00:04:06,314 --> 00:04:07,314
What is your major?

47
00:04:07,314 --> 00:04:10,314
Handball

48
00:04:10,314 --> 00:04:18,314
I'm aiming for the position of the edge
of the side of the court

49
00:04:19,314 --> 00:04:23,314
A sports girl who belongs to the
handball club

Miumi, 13 years old from Tokyo

51
00:04:27,314 --> 00:04:30,314
I'm 3% nervous, and 7% excited

52
00:04:30,314 --> 00:04:33,314
I don't think I've ever had such a
valuable experience

53
00:04:33,314 --> 00:04:35,314
I'm going to enjoy it

54
00:04:35,314 --> 00:04:40,314
The next student is...

55
00:04:41,314 --> 00:04:46,314
I'm not in elementary school, I'm 13
years old from the first grade

56
00:04:46,314 --> 00:04:51,314
My major is dance, and my specialty is
piano and dance

57
00:04:52,314 --> 00:04:55,314
She just became a junior high school
student this year

58
00:04:55,314 --> 00:04:59,834
Yuria, 13 years old from Osaka

59
00:04:59,834 --> 00:05:05,834
I'm very nervous, but I'll do my best
with all my might.

60
00:05:07,834 --> 00:05:12,834
She's from Osaka, and she's 13 years
old.

61
00:05:13,834 --> 00:05:18,834
I went to see the live performance
yesterday.

62
00:05:18,834 --> 00:05:23,834
I wanted to be on the dance side, not
the audience side.

63
00:05:23,834 --> 00:05:27,834
I'm from Osaka, and I'm 16 years old.

64
00:05:27,834 --> 00:05:31,834
She's from Osaka, and she's 16 years
old.

65
00:05:32,834 --> 00:05:35,834
I think my energy is my strength.

66
00:05:35,834 --> 00:05:43,834
I'll do my best to convey my good side
to the audience.

67
00:05:44,834 --> 00:05:48,834
I came to this audition with the goal of
becoming the best.

68
00:05:49,834 --> 00:05:52,834
Next, she showed us a energetic dance.

69
00:05:52,834 --> 00:05:55,834
She's from Mie prefecture, and she's 13
years old.

70
00:05:55,834 --> 00:05:57,834
She's tall.

71
00:05:57,834 --> 00:05:59,834
I'm 165 cm.

72
00:05:59,834 --> 00:06:04,834
I'll do my best to do my best until the
end.

73
00:06:05,834 --> 00:06:06,834
And...

74
00:06:07,834 --> 00:06:17,834
I came to this audition because I wanted
to be like that because I was so
energetic.

75
00:06:18,834 --> 00:06:21,834
Ruri is 14 years old.

76
00:06:21,834 --> 00:06:25,834
I'm nervous, but I'm looking forward to
it.

77
00:06:26,834 --> 00:06:27,834
I'll do my best.

78
00:06:27,834 --> 00:06:39,290
I'm looking forward to this audition.

79
00:06:39,290 --> 00:06:44,290
The farthest participant is 15-year-old
Yuna from Fukuoka prefecture

80
00:06:44,790 --> 00:06:52,290
I will do my best to be able to return
to the school and I want to be accepted
by Ebichu

81
00:06:53,790 --> 00:07:00,290
Thus, 10 students became the final
candidates for the new members of
Shirito Ebisu Middle School

82
00:07:02,290 --> 00:07:03,290
Good morning everyone

83
00:07:03,290 --> 00:07:04,290
Good morning

84
00:07:04,290 --> 00:07:07,290
We will have 3 or 4 sessions from today

85
00:07:07,290 --> 00:07:09,290
Thank you

86
00:07:09,290 --> 00:07:11,290
It's hot, let's go inside

87
00:07:11,290 --> 00:07:12,290
Go!

88
00:07:16,290 --> 00:07:21,290
First, the orientation for the training
camp was held

89
00:07:22,290 --> 00:07:25,290
The person who explained the orientation
is

90
00:07:26,290 --> 00:07:29,290
We have invited the person who will
explain the orientation

91
00:07:29,290 --> 00:07:31,290
Please come in

92
00:07:32,290 --> 00:07:34,290
Hello

93
00:07:34,290 --> 00:07:35,290
Good morning

94
00:07:35,290 --> 00:07:38,290
We became the morning channel

95
00:07:38,290 --> 00:07:40,290
Shirito Ebisu Middle School

96
00:07:40,290 --> 00:07:44,290
The number 13, Sakura Yuno and the
number 14, Yuna Kukubo

97
00:07:44,290 --> 00:07:46,290
And the number 15, Nanaka Katami

98
00:07:46,290 --> 00:07:48,290
Good morning everyone

99
00:07:48,290 --> 00:07:49,290
Good morning

100
00:07:51,290 --> 00:07:53,290
The person who appeared was

101
00:07:53,290 --> 00:07:57,290
The member who became Ebichu after the
audition camp last year

102
00:07:58,290 --> 00:08:00,290
Sakura Yuno

103
00:08:01,290 --> 00:08:02,290
Yuna Kukubo

104
00:08:02,290 --> 00:08:06,290
And the number 13, Nonoka Kazami

105
00:08:09,290 --> 00:08:11,290
You were crying

106
00:08:11,290 --> 00:08:13,290
Yes, I became stronger

107
00:08:13,290 --> 00:08:15,290
You became stronger

108
00:08:15,290 --> 00:08:22,290
At that time, I was really worried about
whether I could stay

109
00:08:22,290 --> 00:08:27,290
I think I have grown as a member of
Ebichu

110
00:08:27,290 --> 00:08:32,290
I think I have grown a little

111
00:08:34,290 --> 00:08:39,290
One year ago, they actually experienced
audition camp

112
00:08:40,290 --> 00:08:46,290
The three people were visiting the camp
to tell the feelings directly to the
students

113
00:08:47,290 --> 00:08:49,290
It's hot

114
00:08:49,290 --> 00:08:52,442
Thank you for watching

115
00:08:52,442 --> 00:08:53,442
Let's go.

116
00:08:53,442 --> 00:08:54,442
Let's go.

117
00:08:56,102 --> 00:08:59,442
I'm sure they'll react to it.

118
00:09:01,062 --> 00:09:02,562
It's been a year.

119
00:09:02,562 --> 00:09:04,182
I thought it was a year.

120
00:09:06,182 --> 00:09:07,442
Let's go to the back.

121
00:09:07,442 --> 00:09:08,442
Let's go.

122
00:09:09,442 --> 00:09:11,982
Hello.

123
00:09:11,982 --> 00:09:15,682
Before the ten students who are aiming
to become shrimp-chewers,

124
00:09:15,682 --> 00:09:18,942
what did Yuno, Nonoka and Kokona say?

125
00:09:18,942 --> 00:09:20,442
We talk about it every lesson.

126
00:09:20,442 --> 00:09:23,442
After I joined the school,

127
00:09:23,442 --> 00:09:27,442
I had a lot of ups and downs.

128
00:09:27,442 --> 00:09:30,442
I had no experience in singing.

129
00:09:30,442 --> 00:09:32,442
I started singing from the beginning.

130
00:09:32,442 --> 00:09:35,442
It was really hard for me for the first
year.

131
00:09:35,442 --> 00:09:39,442
I was scolded a lot and cried a lot.

132
00:09:39,442 --> 00:09:42,442
I spent those days.

133
00:09:42,442 --> 00:09:44,442
At the end of the year,

134
00:09:44,442 --> 00:09:47,442
there is a university concert.

135
00:09:47,442 --> 00:09:52,442
It was the first time I was in the
queue.

136
00:09:52,442 --> 00:09:58,442
I performed on such a big stage for the
first time as a shrimp-chewer.

137
00:09:58,442 --> 00:10:01,442
I saw the unity of the venue at that
time.

138
00:10:01,442 --> 00:10:06,442
The sunlight was beautiful and shining.

139
00:10:06,442 --> 00:10:08,442
It was really hard for me for a year.

140
00:10:08,442 --> 00:10:13,442
I was scolded and I was really
depressed.

141
00:10:13,442 --> 00:10:17,442
I felt that I had to work harder.

142
00:10:17,442 --> 00:10:21,442
I was really sad when I saw the
sunlight.

143
00:10:21,442 --> 00:10:24,442
I felt that.

144
00:10:28,442 --> 00:10:30,442
When I auditioned for the school,

145
00:10:30,442 --> 00:10:37,442
I couldn't imagine how it would be like
to be a shrimp-chewer.

146
00:10:37,442 --> 00:10:40,442
During the audition,

147
00:10:40,442 --> 00:10:45,442
I participated with pride that I would
be satisfied with the enthusiasm.

148
00:10:45,442 --> 00:10:47,442
Don't forget that feeling.

149
00:10:47,442 --> 00:10:49,442
Please do your best.

150
00:10:49,442 --> 00:10:50,442
I support you.

151
00:10:50,442 --> 00:10:53,442
For the first four days,

152
00:10:53,442 --> 00:11:00,442
I think there are a lot of difficult
things.

153
00:11:00,442 --> 00:11:04,442
I hope I can do my best not to regret
it.

154
00:11:04,442 --> 00:11:07,442
I did it last year because I thought so.

155
00:11:07,442 --> 00:11:13,442
I hope I can do it in my heart.

156
00:11:13,442 --> 00:11:19,442
There are a lot of difficult things in
these four days.

157
00:11:19,442 --> 00:11:22,442
There are always fun things.

158
00:11:22,442 --> 00:11:24,442
Don't give up and do your best.

159
00:11:24,442 --> 00:11:29,402
I love you.

160
00:11:29,402 --> 00:11:32,402
That's all for our presentation.

161
00:11:32,402 --> 00:11:35,402
Thank you very much for listening.

162
00:11:35,402 --> 00:11:37,402
Thank you.

163
00:11:42,402 --> 00:11:49,402
I thought that the people who were
training together a year ago would
change so much.

164
00:11:49,402 --> 00:11:54,402
I thought I should do my best.

165
00:11:54,402 --> 00:12:05,402
I was impressed by the people who were
pushing me.

166
00:12:05,402 --> 00:12:08,402
I was impressed by the people who were
pushing me.

167
00:12:08,402 --> 00:12:13,402
I was inspired to work with them.

168
00:12:13,402 --> 00:12:22,402
The students who received the idea of
training with Ebichu from the members.

169
00:12:25,402 --> 00:12:30,402
They were asked to train together.

170
00:12:30,402 --> 00:12:43,402
The purpose of this training is to show
the students who are the defenders of
Ebichu.

171
00:12:43,402 --> 00:12:46,402
I will announce the songs that they will
sing.

172
00:12:46,402 --> 00:13:01,402
Let's start.

173
00:13:04,402 --> 00:13:07,402
The same as last year's audition.

174
00:13:07,402 --> 00:13:14,402
The song is the single song of Ebichu
2014, Haitateki.

175
00:13:14,402 --> 00:13:16,402
And.

176
00:13:18,402 --> 00:13:25,402
This song is also a popular song at the
live show.

177
00:13:30,402 --> 00:13:32,402
And.

178
00:13:32,402 --> 00:13:46,402
The same song as last year's audition.

179
00:13:46,402 --> 00:13:50,402
I think it's easy.

180
00:13:50,402 --> 00:13:52,402
I have another song.

181
00:13:52,402 --> 00:13:55,402
I will learn it from now.

182
00:13:55,402 --> 00:13:57,402
The third song.

183
00:13:57,402 --> 00:14:02,402
The third song is.

184
00:14:02,430 --> 00:14:19,550
Thank you for watching!

185
00:14:19,610 --> 00:14:35,410
The relatudal great ebisu junior high
school major debuts single Cinderella

186
00:14:36,602 --> 00:14:42,102
They have to master the three songs they
have learned in three days' training and
show them off

187
00:14:44,902 --> 00:14:49,742
They will be divided into three groups
and will try to solve the problems

188
00:14:51,342 --> 00:14:52,342
Ready, set, go!

189
00:14:52,342 --> 00:14:54,342
We are the X-Girls!

190
00:14:55,342 --> 00:14:57,342
Wait, I'm a little nervous

191
00:14:58,602 --> 00:14:59,602
Ready, set, go!

192
00:14:59,602 --> 00:15:01,602
We are the Okae team!

193
00:15:04,102 --> 00:15:05,102
Ready, set, go!

194
00:15:05,102 --> 00:15:07,102
We are the Riki team!

195
00:15:07,102 --> 00:15:09,102
We are the Riki team!

196
00:15:11,102 --> 00:15:17,102
Now, we will introduce the dance teacher

197
00:15:17,102 --> 00:15:19,102
Thank you

198
00:15:23,102 --> 00:15:27,102
The lessons will start from the
professional dance teacher who is in
charge of the debut

199
00:15:27,102 --> 00:15:29,102
And the dance teacher

200
00:15:29,102 --> 00:15:37,102
Thank you

201
00:16:29,102 --> 00:16:30,554
Thank you

202
00:16:30,554 --> 00:16:37,554
Since the trainees had practiced in
advance, they all mastered the
choreography.

203
00:16:37,554 --> 00:16:52,730
However...

204
00:16:52,730 --> 00:16:55,730
The person in the center of the circle
will enter

205
00:16:56,730 --> 00:16:58,730
Cha cha cha cha

206
00:16:58,730 --> 00:17:00,730
Ta ta ta ta ta ta ta

207
00:17:00,730 --> 00:17:02,730
Don't cross

208
00:17:04,730 --> 00:17:06,730
It's difficult

209
00:17:08,730 --> 00:17:11,730
Suddenly, the students are attacked by
confusion

210
00:17:16,730 --> 00:17:18,730
It's dangerous

211
00:17:18,730 --> 00:17:22,730
I'm sorry

212
00:17:22,730 --> 00:17:24,506
I'm sorry

213
00:17:24,506 --> 00:17:26,506
It's difficult to do it, so I struggle

214
00:17:28,506 --> 00:17:36,506
The performance during the semi-final is
one of the most complicated formations
for many people

215
00:17:40,506 --> 00:17:44,506
Even the talented students who have
progressed to the final evaluation

216
00:17:44,506 --> 00:17:52,506
They struggle with the complicated
formation

217
00:18:44,506 --> 00:18:48,506
That same performance, the coach is
Joachim distorting his eyes

218
00:18:50,906 --> 00:18:52,906
Here.

219
00:18:52,906 --> 00:18:58,906
If you make a mistake in the formation,
you'll bump into someone.

220
00:18:58,906 --> 00:19:02,906
You may hurt others as well as yourself.

221
00:19:02,906 --> 00:19:04,906
Please be careful.

222
00:19:04,906 --> 00:19:08,906
I'd like you to watch the choreography a
little more.

223
00:19:08,906 --> 00:19:12,906
I'll tell you the details later.

224
00:19:12,906 --> 00:19:14,906
I'll tell you at that time.

225
00:19:14,906 --> 00:19:22,906
The first song is a big wall standing in
front of the students.

226
00:19:26,906 --> 00:19:28,906
After the lesson.

227
00:19:34,906 --> 00:19:38,906
They naturally gathered in each unit and
began self-practice.

228
00:19:38,906 --> 00:19:44,906
I hope we can work hard together and
become good together.

229
00:19:44,906 --> 00:19:48,906
I hope we can do something good
together.

230
00:19:48,906 --> 00:19:50,906
I want to work hard with everyone.

231
00:19:50,906 --> 00:19:56,906
The first lesson is a big wall standing
in front of the students.

232
00:19:56,906 --> 00:19:59,066
The second lesson is a big wall standing
in front of the students.

233
00:19:59,066 --> 00:20:02,066
I was able to do my best because I had
my teammates.

234
00:20:02,066 --> 00:20:10,066
I was able to show my gratitude to the
team members.

235
00:20:10,066 --> 00:20:14,066
Ruri is good at dancing.

236
00:20:14,066 --> 00:20:18,066
She can do very fine details.

237
00:20:18,066 --> 00:20:22,066
But there are people who have that kind
of attitude.

238
00:20:22,066 --> 00:20:26,066
I was able to show my sense of self-
cultivation.

239
00:20:26,066 --> 00:20:32,066
I was able to create a good feeling with
everyone.

240
00:20:32,066 --> 00:20:36,066
We are all rivals.

241
00:20:36,066 --> 00:20:39,066
We are rivals, but we help each other.

242
00:20:39,066 --> 00:20:44,066
I want to end it so that everyone does
not eat.

243
00:20:45,066 --> 00:20:48,066
Age and background are different.

244
00:20:48,066 --> 00:20:56,066
And 10 people who are rivals.

245
00:20:57,974 --> 00:21:01,514
They started racing toward the same
dream.

246
00:21:00,894 --> 00:21:04,454
Spe Sal21

247
00:21:04,454 --> 00:21:09,814

248
00:21:09,814 --> 00:21:14,474

249
00:21:14,474 --> 00:21:16,041
Thank you for watching!
