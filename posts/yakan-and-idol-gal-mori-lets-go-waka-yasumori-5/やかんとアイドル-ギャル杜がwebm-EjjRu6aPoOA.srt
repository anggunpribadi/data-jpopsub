1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Yakan and idols!

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:07,000
Can I ask you to tell us about it?

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:08,000
Yes!

4
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:15,000
We, Iginari Talk, will have a tour of
the country that will never lose in
spring!

5
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:19,888
We have a team!

6
00:00:19,888 --> 00:00:21,888
There are 12 songs in total.

7
00:00:21,888 --> 00:00:23,888
Oh, I see!

8
00:00:23,888 --> 00:00:25,888
It's my hobby.

9
00:00:25,888 --> 00:00:27,888
That's amazing!

10
00:00:27,888 --> 00:00:29,888
I see.

11
00:00:29,888 --> 00:00:31,888
I see.

12
00:00:31,888 --> 00:00:33,888
There are 9 songs in total.

13
00:00:33,888 --> 00:00:35,888
Yes, there are 9 songs in total.

14
00:00:35,888 --> 00:00:39,888
Please come and enjoy!

15
00:00:41,338 --> 00:00:48,338
Then, please look at the sweets in each
place and eat them.

16
00:00:48,338 --> 00:00:55,338
So, can I give you a tea that will cheer
you up at the end?

17
00:00:55,338 --> 00:00:58,338
I'll give you Jasmine tea.

18
00:00:58,338 --> 00:01:01,338
Yay! I love it!

19
00:01:01,338 --> 00:01:02,338
Really?

20
00:01:02,338 --> 00:01:03,338
I like tea the most.

21
00:01:03,338 --> 00:01:04,338
Oh, that's good.

22
00:01:04,338 --> 00:01:07,680
I hope you'll take a deep breath and
relax.

23
00:01:08,680 --> 00:01:09,680
Cheers!

24
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:10,680
Thank you!

25
00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:11,680
Happy!

26
00:01:12,680 --> 00:01:14,680
You're a good girl!

27
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:16,680
Let's eat!

28
00:01:16,680 --> 00:01:18,680
I'm a different person!

29
00:01:24,314 --> 00:01:26,314
I'm dying.

30
00:01:26,314 --> 00:01:28,314
You're dying?

31
00:01:28,314 --> 00:01:30,314
I'm happy for you, Yakan.

32
00:01:30,314 --> 00:01:32,314
Thank you!

33
00:01:32,314 --> 00:01:36,314
Oh, I almost forgot!

34
00:01:36,314 --> 00:01:40,314
You have a farm?

35
00:01:40,314 --> 00:01:42,314
Yes, I have a farm.

36
00:01:42,314 --> 00:01:44,314
What is it?

37
00:01:44,314 --> 00:01:54,314
I rent a farm at the shopping mall in
Sendai Station.

38
00:01:54,314 --> 00:01:56,314
I have a farm called Yasunori Farm.

39
00:01:56,314 --> 00:01:58,314
You have a farm?

40
00:01:58,314 --> 00:01:59,314
Yes.

41
00:01:59,314 --> 00:02:00,314
You can make a farm?

42
00:02:00,314 --> 00:02:01,314
Yes.

43
00:02:01,314 --> 00:02:04,314
I'm on vacation now.

44
00:02:04,314 --> 00:02:08,314
I grew cucumbers last year.

45
00:02:08,314 --> 00:02:13,314
I have a harvest festival every year.

46
00:02:13,314 --> 00:02:16,314
I didn't grow cucumbers last year.

47
00:02:16,314 --> 00:02:17,314
Why did you grow cucumbers this year?

48
00:02:17,314 --> 00:02:24,314
I wanted to grow cucumbers this year,
but I couldn't grow the same crops for
two years in a row.

49
00:02:24,314 --> 00:02:25,314
Because the soil was bad?

50
00:02:25,314 --> 00:02:27,314
Yes, because the soil was bad.

51
00:02:27,314 --> 00:02:33,314
I couldn't grow the same crops, so I
didn't grow cucumbers.

52
00:02:33,314 --> 00:02:38,314
But I harvested about 60 cucumbers last
year.

53
00:02:38,314 --> 00:02:40,314
You harvested 60 cucumbers?

54
00:02:40,314 --> 00:02:41,314
You grew a lot.

55
00:02:41,314 --> 00:02:44,314
I couldn't eat cucumbers anymore.

56
00:02:44,314 --> 00:02:48,314
What are you going to grow this year?

57
00:02:48,314 --> 00:02:51,314
I'm going to grow bell peppers this
year.

58
00:02:51,314 --> 00:02:52,314
I'm going to try.

59
00:02:52,314 --> 00:02:55,314
How do you grow bell peppers?

60
00:02:55,314 --> 00:02:56,314
Bell peppers?

61
00:02:56,314 --> 00:02:57,314
Really?

62
00:02:57,314 --> 00:02:58,314
I think it's okay.

63
00:02:58,314 --> 00:02:59,314
Really?

64
00:02:59,314 --> 00:03:06,314
I'm really grateful to the farmers.

65
00:03:06,314 --> 00:03:11,314
I had a hard time growing cucumbers in
the last two years.

66
00:03:11,314 --> 00:03:14,314
I thought I was in a supermarket.

67
00:03:14,314 --> 00:03:16,314
I was about to cry.

68
00:03:16,314 --> 00:03:21,314
I didn't know that the cucumbers in the
supermarket were so beautiful.

69
00:03:21,314 --> 00:03:26,314
I'm so impressed.

70
00:03:26,314 --> 00:03:27,314
I'm looking forward to it.

71
00:03:27,314 --> 00:03:33,314
I'm going to try to grow bell peppers.

72
00:03:33,314 --> 00:03:39,314
I'll leave it to you to decide if I'm
cute or gyaru.

73
00:03:39,314 --> 00:03:43,314
If you say something to the camera, this
program will end.

74
00:03:43,314 --> 00:03:47,314
That's all for tonight.

75
00:03:47,314 --> 00:03:52,896
Bye bye.

76
00:03:52,896 --> 00:03:56,216
Nightë¯¼ and idol

77
00:04:13,882 --> 00:04:19,882

chan.

78
