00:00:00,090 --> 00:00:07,090
This week's Ebitune Tastas is
challenging a TV reporter for the first
time

2
00:00:08,090 --> 00:00:12,090
Ebitune is interviewing a chicken in
various spots

3
00:00:12,090 --> 00:00:22,090
Sascade

4
00:00:23,968 --> 00:00:26,968
A report battle that is too free

5
00:00:26,968 --> 00:00:28,968
I was talking

6
00:00:28,968 --> 00:00:53,498
Emitiu Sastus start

7
00:00:53,498 --> 00:01:03,498
We will add various things to the
private and private schools

8
00:01:03,498 --> 00:01:08,498
FNC DASTAR

9
00:01:10,498 --> 00:01:14,498
This program is provided by the sponsor
you see

10
00:01:14,498 --> 00:01:23,498
It's a little expensive, isn't it?

11
00:01:23,578 --> 00:01:27,578
Ebichu Tastas has started!

12
00:01:29,578 --> 00:01:31,578
Where are we now?

13
00:01:32,578 --> 00:01:34,578
We are in Venus Island!

14
00:01:34,578 --> 00:01:52,578
There are a lot of foreigners here
today!

15
00:01:53,168 --> 00:01:55,168
I don't know at all!

16
00:01:55,168 --> 00:01:57,168
I don't know at all!

17
00:01:57,168 --> 00:01:59,168
I'm just looking at it like, what is it?

18
00:01:59,168 --> 00:02:03,168
Today, Kobayashi is...

19
00:02:03,168 --> 00:02:07,168
That's right. Today, she has other work.

20
00:02:07,168 --> 00:02:10,168
By the way, have you all been on Venus
boat?

21
00:02:10,168 --> 00:02:11,168
Yes!

22
00:02:11,168 --> 00:02:12,168
Anyone?

23
00:02:12,168 --> 00:02:13,168
Yes!

24
00:02:13,168 --> 00:02:18,168
Since we're here on Venus boat, let's go
eat something together!

25
00:02:19,168 --> 00:02:21,168
No, no, no!

26
00:02:21,168 --> 00:02:23,168
No, no, no!

27
00:02:23,168 --> 00:02:25,168
I'm sorry!

28
00:02:25,168 --> 00:02:26,168
Sorry!

29
00:02:26,168 --> 00:02:27,168
As expected!

30
00:02:27,168 --> 00:02:28,168
It's not like that!

31
00:02:28,168 --> 00:02:30,168
We're not going to buy anything today!

32
00:02:30,168 --> 00:02:32,168
Why? We've been excited for a long time!

33
00:02:32,168 --> 00:02:35,168
We're going to do something very
important for Ebichu!

34
00:02:35,168 --> 00:02:39,168
Ebichu, everyone is shy, right?

35
00:02:39,168 --> 00:02:42,168
Ebichu is a group that is shy.

36
00:02:42,168 --> 00:02:44,168
Yes, it's a group that is shy.

37
00:02:44,168 --> 00:02:48,168
In the dressing room and the dressing
room, they tend to get together.

38
00:02:48,168 --> 00:02:51,168
Is it okay for us to talk to each other
like this?

39
00:02:51,168 --> 00:02:52,168
No, no, no!

40
00:02:52,168 --> 00:02:54,168
Don't look down at us!

41
00:02:54,168 --> 00:02:55,168
We're idols!

42
00:02:55,168 --> 00:02:59,168
Do you all practice to overcome shyness?

43
00:02:59,168 --> 00:03:00,168
Practice?

44
00:03:00,168 --> 00:03:02,168
Practice? Like, be careful of this?

45
00:03:02,168 --> 00:03:06,168
When I talk to the members one-on-one,

46
00:03:06,168 --> 00:03:08,168
I try to keep the conversation going.

47
00:03:08,168 --> 00:03:11,168
When I get home from the train, for
example, Riko-chan,

48
00:03:11,168 --> 00:03:16,168
I try to talk to the type of girl that I
don't talk to myself.

49
00:03:16,168 --> 00:03:18,168
That's great!

50
00:03:18,168 --> 00:03:19,168
That's great!

51
00:03:19,168 --> 00:03:21,168
Does that help you, Nakayama?

52
00:03:21,168 --> 00:03:23,136
Yes!

53
00:03:23,136 --> 00:03:25,136
I was listening to you.

54
00:03:25,136 --> 00:03:27,136
We are working now.

55
00:03:27,136 --> 00:03:29,136
Didn't you hear the sound of Nakayama?

56
00:03:29,136 --> 00:03:31,136
No, I didn't.

57
00:03:31,136 --> 00:03:38,704
Everyone is working hard, but not enough
to overcome the loneliness.

58
00:03:38,704 --> 00:03:41,704
So, today's event is...

59
00:03:41,704 --> 00:04:05,744
the Ebitune's

60
00:03:43,704 --> 00:03:46,704
Overcoming the Loneliness, the reporter
battle!

61
00:03:48,704 --> 00:03:51,704
We are Venusport!

62
00:03:53,704 --> 00:03:55,704
We will be interviewing the reporters
without knowing them,

63
00:03:55,704 --> 00:03:59,704
and will try to make it easy for them to
understand the information.

64
00:04:00,704 --> 00:04:02,704
This time, we will be divided into 4
teams,

65
00:04:02,704 --> 00:04:06,816
and will be reporting from different
locations.

66
00:04:06,816 --> 00:04:09,816
First, Hoshina Matsuno pair!

67
00:04:11,816 --> 00:04:15,816
They will be doing an interesting goods
report at a popular store!

68
00:04:19,816 --> 00:04:25,816
The two people who love shopping will be
telling the charm of popular products.

69
00:04:26,816 --> 00:04:29,816
Next, Kashiwagi Nakayama pair!

70
00:04:29,816 --> 00:04:35,600
They will be doing a dog cafe report
with their beloved dog!

71
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:36,600
What?

72
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:38,600
I like dog cafes!

73
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:40,600
I'm scared of dogs though

74
00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:42,600
Why are you happy?

75
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:44,600
I love animals

76
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:49,600
Nakayama who is not good at animal-
loving kashiwagi and is happy with it

77
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:52,600
challenges a report using dogs

78
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:55,600
Next, Hirota-peer Yasumoto

79
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:59,600
A lively bouldering report

80
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:00,600
What?

81
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:03,600
I want to climb it

82
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:05,600
It's a dog cafe!

83
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:06,600
Please wait

84
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:09,600
The two who are athletic

85
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:12,600
A report of a body-building experience

86
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:14,600
What will it be?

87
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:17,600
Last, Mayama-Rika

88
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:21,600
A gourmet report of a royal road who
enjoys authentic Korean food

89
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:23,600
Yay!

90
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:24,600
But are you alone?

91
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:26,600
It's okay to say it in one way

92
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:29,600
Mayama and Rika pair is fine

93
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:31,600
You are alone

94
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:35,600
Mayama is doing a royal road report by
herself

95
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:40,400
Will she be able to convey the taste
well?

96
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:45,400
A report battle where each team is
divided into 4 different locations and
conducts a broadcast.

97
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:52,400
Which team will be able to report the
most effectively by blowing away the
shyness?

98
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:59,400
The top batter is Hirota Yasumoto's
bouldering experience report.

99
00:05:59,400 --> 00:06:06,800
First, let's start with a look at the
report to confirm the flow.

100
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:08,800
Raise your hips like this.

101
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:09,800
Wow!

102
00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:12,800
And grab the top of your head like this.

103
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:14,992
Wow!

104
00:06:14,992 --> 00:06:20,992
It's important to convey the information
you've gained while being able to
understand it.

105
00:06:20,992 --> 00:06:24,992
I was surprised because I didn't know
the meaning of the colors.

106
00:06:24,992 --> 00:06:26,992
It's fashionable.

107
00:06:27,992 --> 00:06:29,992
Now, the preview is over.

108
00:06:29,992 --> 00:06:32,992
Let's start the studio and the
broadcast.

109
00:06:33,992 --> 00:06:35,992
Let's start the show.

110
00:06:35,992 --> 00:06:38,992
Let's start the studio and the
broadcast.

111
00:06:38,992 --> 00:06:44,992
Today, we will introduce the facilities
where you can experience the real
activity in Tokyo.

112
00:06:44,992 --> 00:06:51,674
The broadcast is connected. Yasumoto-
san, Hiroto-san.

113
00:06:51,674 --> 00:06:53,674
Hi, I'm Aika Hirota.

114
00:06:53,674 --> 00:06:59,674
I'm at an outdoor resort circus.

115
00:06:59,674 --> 00:07:07,674
I'm going to use this outdoor
convenience store and barbecue.

116
00:07:07,674 --> 00:07:11,674
I'm going to use this for barbecue.

117
00:07:11,674 --> 00:07:13,674
She fixed it herself.

118
00:07:13,674 --> 00:07:15,674
She fixed it herself.

119
00:07:15,674 --> 00:07:19,674
I'm going to go inside.

120
00:07:19,674 --> 00:07:25,674
However, there is no Yasumoto-san who
will do it with me.

121
00:07:25,674 --> 00:07:27,674
I'm glad.

122
00:07:27,674 --> 00:07:32,192
Please subscribe to my channel.

123
00:07:32,192 --> 00:07:34,192
No, it's not.

124
00:07:34,192 --> 00:07:36,192
It's not that.

125
00:07:36,192 --> 00:07:38,192
I was wrong.

126
00:07:38,192 --> 00:07:40,192
I'm sorry.

127
00:07:40,192 --> 00:07:42,192
Hello, I'm Yasumoto.

128
00:07:42,192 --> 00:07:44,192
Nice to meet you.

129
00:07:44,192 --> 00:07:48,192
It's a long way to go.

130
00:07:48,192 --> 00:07:52,192
They followed a long way and went to...

131
00:07:52,192 --> 00:07:57,328
Amazing.

132
00:07:57,328 --> 00:07:59,328
So handsome.

133
00:07:59,328 --> 00:08:01,328
He's doing something.

134
00:08:01,328 --> 00:08:03,328
He's coming.

135
00:08:05,328 --> 00:08:07,328
Welcome to the first floor.

136
00:08:07,328 --> 00:08:08,912
Yes.

137
00:08:08,912 --> 00:08:14,912
It's a sport of climbing.

138
00:08:14,912 --> 00:08:20,912
It's a sport to climb a river, small
rocks, and rocks.

139
00:08:20,912 --> 00:08:22,912
I'll explain it to you.

140
00:08:23,912 --> 00:08:25,912
Can I ask you to introduce yourself?

141
00:08:25,912 --> 00:08:30,560
My name is Sharon. Thank you.

142
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:32,560
Which country are you from?

143
00:08:32,560 --> 00:08:34,560
Ladies in front of the TV,

144
00:08:34,560 --> 00:08:38,560
It's rare to meet such a handsome guy.

145
00:08:38,560 --> 00:08:42,560
Please be healed while you come to play
with your child.

146
00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:46,560
Which country are you from?

147
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:48,560
It's my first time.

148
00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:50,560
You can't hear it at all.

149
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:52,560
I can't hear it.

150
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:54,560
I'm from the Jiro.

151
00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:56,560
The other people are climbing up.

152
00:08:56,560 --> 00:08:58,560
Yes.

153
00:08:58,560 --> 00:09:00,560
It's like climbing up the stairs.

154
00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:02,560
If you hit the ceiling with your head,
you'll get a goal.

155
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:04,560
Please do your best.

156
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:06,560
I'm going.

157
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:08,560
First of all, you're a beginner.

158
00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:12,560
The beginners are free to climb.

159
00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:14,560
I see.

160
00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:16,560
Yasumoto-san.

161
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:18,560
Don't forget the idol.

162
00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:20,560
Yasumoto-san.

163
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:23,540
Yasumoto-san, it's like a

164
00:09:23,540 --> 00:09:25,540
Hirota is fast.

165
00:09:25,540 --> 00:09:27,540
Yasumoto-san is really good.

166
00:09:27,540 --> 00:09:29,540
Wait a minute, Hirota-san.

167
00:09:29,540 --> 00:09:31,540
Hirota-san, wait a minute.

168
00:09:31,540 --> 00:09:33,540
I'm going now.

169
00:09:37,540 --> 00:09:39,540
Wait a minute.

170
00:09:39,540 --> 00:09:41,540
It's easy.

171
00:09:41,540 --> 00:09:43,540
Only you can do it.

172
00:09:43,540 --> 00:09:45,540
It's pretty difficult.

173
00:09:45,540 --> 00:09:49,540
It's fun to be excited.

174
00:09:49,540 --> 00:09:51,540
That's good.

175
00:09:51,540 --> 00:09:53,540
Even if you're not confident,

176
00:09:53,540 --> 00:09:55,540
I want you to try.

177
00:09:55,540 --> 00:09:59,540
It's easy to grab the dented part.

178
00:09:59,540 --> 00:10:01,540
You have to put your feet on the
slippery part.

179
00:10:01,540 --> 00:10:05,540
It's hard to grab because your feet
hurt.

180
00:10:05,540 --> 00:10:07,540
I think it's a good tip.

181
00:10:07,540 --> 00:10:09,540
That's good.

182
00:10:09,540 --> 00:10:11,540
There's a little difficult climbing.

183
00:10:11,540 --> 00:10:13,540
There's a real climbing.

184
00:10:13,540 --> 00:10:15,540
I've already climbed up.

185
00:10:15,540 --> 00:10:17,540
Would you like to try it?

186
00:10:17,540 --> 00:10:19,540
There's another difficult climbing.

187
00:10:19,540 --> 00:10:21,540
I'll show you this.

188
00:10:21,540 --> 00:10:23,540
The tempo is good.

189
00:10:23,540 --> 00:10:25,540
Next, the difficulty level is up.

190
00:10:25,540 --> 00:10:27,540
Yasumoto is challenging.

191
00:10:27,540 --> 00:10:29,540
Can you do it?

192
00:10:29,540 --> 00:10:31,540
Can you do it?

193
00:10:33,540 --> 00:10:35,540
It's high.

194
00:10:37,540 --> 00:10:39,540
How many meters is this height?

195
00:10:41,540 --> 00:10:43,540
This is 7 meters.

196
00:10:43,540 --> 00:10:45,540
It's amazing.

197
00:10:45,540 --> 00:10:47,540
It's scary.

198
00:10:47,540 --> 00:10:49,540
There are many things to see up close.

199
00:10:49,540 --> 00:10:51,540
The height is from the bottom.

200
00:10:51,540 --> 00:10:55,540
It's scary to see it from the bottom.

201
00:10:55,540 --> 00:10:57,540
Can you tell me the tips again?

202
00:10:57,540 --> 00:11:06,016
Please subscribe to the channel.

203
00:11:06,016 --> 00:11:08,016
It's hot.

204
00:11:09,016 --> 00:11:11,016
There is no such thing.

205
00:11:11,016 --> 00:11:13,016
There is a yellow line.

206
00:11:13,016 --> 00:11:15,016
Climb up to that line.

207
00:11:15,016 --> 00:11:19,016
You will reach the goal if you stand on
the board.

208
00:11:19,016 --> 00:11:22,016
Kitagawa will give you instructions.

209
00:11:22,016 --> 00:11:24,016
Please fasten your rope.

210
00:11:24,016 --> 00:11:27,016
You can grab the rope firmly on the
board.

211
00:11:27,016 --> 00:11:33,016
After that, you will jump over the wall.

212
00:11:33,016 --> 00:11:39,016
Please get on the board.

213
00:11:39,016 --> 00:11:41,016
Please start.

214
00:11:42,016 --> 00:11:44,016
Please put your feet in the pot.

215
00:11:44,016 --> 00:11:47,016
Please put your feet in the pot.

216
00:11:47,016 --> 00:11:49,016
What's the pot?

217
00:11:50,016 --> 00:11:54,016
Please get on the board.

218
00:11:54,016 --> 00:11:56,016
Amazing.

219
00:11:56,016 --> 00:12:01,016
Please move forward.

220
00:12:02,016 --> 00:12:06,016
It seems that you can climb up quickly.

221
00:12:06,016 --> 00:12:08,016
Nice.

222
00:12:08,016 --> 00:12:10,016
It seems that you can climb up quickly.

223
00:12:10,016 --> 00:12:12,016
It's a lot higher.

224
00:12:12,016 --> 00:12:14,016
Amazing.

225
00:12:14,016 --> 00:12:20,016
It's much more open than inside.

226
00:12:20,016 --> 00:12:22,016
Amazing.

227
00:12:22,016 --> 00:12:25,016
You are almost there.

228
00:12:25,016 --> 00:12:28,112
Please subscribe to the channel.

229
00:12:28,112 --> 00:12:30,112
Success!

230
00:12:30,112 --> 00:12:32,112
I did it!

231
00:12:32,112 --> 00:12:33,626
Good!

232
00:12:33,626 --> 00:12:35,232
Thank you.

233
00:12:35,232 --> 00:12:37,232
From now on, it's a safe place

234
00:12:37,232 --> 00:12:39,232
Yasumoto, how is the view from there?

235
00:12:41,232 --> 00:12:43,232
What?

236
00:12:51,232 --> 00:12:55,232
Yasumoto-san, how is the view from
above?

237
00:12:57,232 --> 00:13:03,232
This is...the ceiling is shaped like the
sky

238
00:13:03,232 --> 00:13:10,232
So, it feels like climbing a mountain

239
00:13:10,232 --> 00:13:14,976
I feel like I'm a pro

240
00:13:14,976 --> 00:13:16,976
Why did you put your neck up?

241
00:13:16,976 --> 00:13:18,976
Why did you look like a tagger?

242
00:13:20,976 --> 00:13:24,976
How was the exercise?

243
00:13:24,976 --> 00:13:26,976
I started sweating a lot

244
00:13:26,976 --> 00:13:30,976
I think it's perfect for when I want to
exercise

245
00:13:30,976 --> 00:13:34,976
I think it's good to do it indoors with
your family

246
00:13:34,976 --> 00:13:40,976
If you don't have enough exercise, why
don't you try climbing at the Odaiba?

247
00:13:40,976 --> 00:13:44,976
We will be waiting for you on the stage

248
00:13:44,976 --> 00:13:46,976
Last one

249
00:13:46,976 --> 00:13:48,976
What did you say?

250
00:13:48,976 --> 00:13:50,976
Last one

251
00:13:50,976 --> 00:13:52,976
What?

252
00:13:52,976 --> 00:13:58,976
Hirota was good at doing the one where
Yasumoto was doing the fluffy one

253
00:13:58,976 --> 00:14:00,976
That's right

254
00:14:00,976 --> 00:14:07,976
When Yasumoto was climbing, Hirota was
doing the one where she was doing the
talk

255
00:14:07,976 --> 00:14:09,976
I'm glad it wasn't the other way around

256
00:14:09,976 --> 00:14:13,976
If Hirota was still there, Yasumoto
would have done the one where she was
doing the talk

257
00:14:13,976 --> 00:14:15,976
I wanted to see that too

258
00:14:15,976 --> 00:14:25,504
Next is Hashiwagi Nakayama's report on
dog cafe

259
00:14:25,504 --> 00:14:28,504
First, let's start with the scene

260
00:14:29,504 --> 00:14:35,504
Which one is better, the chair or the
chair?

261
00:14:35,504 --> 00:14:37,504
Which one is easier to shoot?

262
00:14:37,504 --> 00:14:42,504
While discussing with the cameraman,
they are thinking about the flow of the
report

263
00:14:42,504 --> 00:14:44,504
Please put it in front of you

264
00:14:44,504 --> 00:14:52,504
And the dog that will be their partner
appears

265
00:14:53,408 --> 00:14:58,408
Can they report while controlling the
naughty dog?

266
00:14:59,408 --> 00:15:03,408
Then, the broadcast starts

267
00:15:04,408 --> 00:15:09,408
Now, the cafe where you can enter with
pets is popular

268
00:15:09,408 --> 00:15:11,408
It seems that the broadcast is connected

269
00:15:11,408 --> 00:15:16,186
Kashiwage-san, Nakayama-san

270
00:15:16,186 --> 00:15:19,186
Hello everyone, I'm Ginnata Kashiwagi.

271
00:15:19,186 --> 00:15:23,186
Today I'm at Venus Fort in Odaiba.

272
00:15:23,186 --> 00:15:26,186
I'm at the pet shop on the first floor.

273
00:15:28,186 --> 00:15:31,186
But Nakaima-san isn't here.

274
00:15:31,186 --> 00:15:33,186
Oh, so this is the pattern.

275
00:15:33,186 --> 00:15:36,186
Yes, so I want to go look for him.

276
00:15:36,186 --> 00:15:37,186
Please do.

277
00:15:37,186 --> 00:15:41,186
I hear a voice.

278
00:15:41,186 --> 00:15:43,186
Nakaima-san?

279
00:15:43,186 --> 00:15:46,186
Nakaima-san, what are you doing?

280
00:15:46,186 --> 00:15:48,186
Nakaima-san, what are you doing?

281
00:15:48,186 --> 00:15:50,186
So cute.

282
00:15:50,186 --> 00:15:56,186
Right now, this dog is in a free release
campaign.

283
00:15:58,186 --> 00:16:01,186
So right now, he's playing with me.

284
00:16:01,186 --> 00:16:02,186
Nakaima-san.

285
00:16:02,186 --> 00:16:04,186
Who's playing with you?

286
00:16:04,186 --> 00:16:05,186
Nakaima-san.

287
00:16:05,186 --> 00:16:08,208
Hello.

288
00:16:08,208 --> 00:16:09,208
What's your name?

289
00:16:09,208 --> 00:16:10,208
My name is...

290
00:16:11,208 --> 00:16:13,208
Ten-kun.

291
00:16:14,208 --> 00:16:15,208
I know that name.

292
00:16:16,208 --> 00:16:18,208
You know that name, too.

293
00:16:19,208 --> 00:16:20,208
I heard it because I knew it.

294
00:16:22,208 --> 00:16:24,208
The two are full of comments.

295
00:16:24,208 --> 00:16:26,208
Next, I will introduce the dog cafe.

296
00:16:29,208 --> 00:16:31,208
Ten-kun and one more dog.

297
00:16:32,208 --> 00:16:33,208
They are not alike.

298
00:16:35,208 --> 00:16:36,208
The food looks delicious.

299
00:16:36,208 --> 00:16:37,208
Ten-kun.

300
00:16:37,208 --> 00:16:40,208
This is a report from the dog cafe,
right?

301
00:16:42,208 --> 00:16:44,208
This is a dog cafe.

302
00:16:44,208 --> 00:16:46,208
This is a dog cafe.

303
00:16:47,208 --> 00:16:49,208
This is a dog cafe.

304
00:16:49,208 --> 00:16:57,424
You can eat here with your dog.

305
00:16:57,424 --> 00:16:59,424
Let's go.

306
00:16:59,424 --> 00:17:03,024
Hello.

307
00:17:03,024 --> 00:17:07,024
I can eat with my dog here.

308
00:17:07,024 --> 00:17:08,024
That's right.

309
00:17:10,024 --> 00:17:12,024
Do your best.

310
00:17:12,024 --> 00:17:15,024
Do you have any recommendations for
food?

311
00:17:15,024 --> 00:17:19,024
The most popular is this one called one
pack one bag.

312
00:17:20,024 --> 00:17:21,024
One pack one bag?

313
00:17:21,024 --> 00:17:26,024
It's a beef rib meat, but it's very
juicy.

314
00:17:26,024 --> 00:17:27,024
Kashiwagi-san.

315
00:17:27,024 --> 00:17:28,024
Kashiwagi-san.

316
00:17:28,024 --> 00:17:29,024
I want to eat it.

317
00:17:29,024 --> 00:17:34,024
As a joke, can you say that we want one
pack one bag?

318
00:17:38,024 --> 00:17:39,024
Should I say it?

319
00:17:39,024 --> 00:17:41,024
Yes, please show us once.

320
00:17:41,024 --> 00:17:43,024
The manager's reaction.

321
00:17:45,024 --> 00:17:47,024
Then we should also...

322
00:17:47,024 --> 00:17:54,024
Ten-kun wants one pack one bag, and we
should say sweet.

323
00:17:54,024 --> 00:17:55,024
Sweet?

324
00:17:55,024 --> 00:17:56,024
Sweet?

325
00:17:56,024 --> 00:17:58,024
Should I say it?

326
00:17:58,024 --> 00:18:00,024
I think we should say one pack one bag.

327
00:18:02,024 --> 00:18:03,024
One pack one bag.

328
00:18:03,024 --> 00:18:04,024
One pack one bag.

329
00:18:04,024 --> 00:18:05,024
One pack one bag.

330
00:18:05,024 --> 00:18:06,024
Yes.

331
00:18:06,024 --> 00:18:07,024
That's right.

332
00:18:08,024 --> 00:18:09,024
She laughed a little.

333
00:18:12,024 --> 00:18:13,024
Shue-san.

334
00:18:15,024 --> 00:18:16,024
Shue-san.

335
00:18:16,024 --> 00:18:17,024
Shue-san.

336
00:18:17,024 --> 00:18:19,024
The manager laughed a little.

337
00:18:19,024 --> 00:18:21,024
This is for one-chan.

338
00:18:21,024 --> 00:18:22,024
This is for one-chan.

339
00:18:22,024 --> 00:18:23,024
It's kind.

340
00:18:23,024 --> 00:18:24,024
It's kind.

341
00:18:24,024 --> 00:18:28,024
They ordered the recommended menu.

342
00:18:28,024 --> 00:18:30,024
One pack one bag.

343
00:18:30,024 --> 00:18:31,024
Yes, please.

344
00:18:31,024 --> 00:18:32,024
Please.

345
00:18:32,024 --> 00:18:38,880
Start the food report with Ten-kun.

346
00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:40,880
Here it is.

347
00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:49,880
Let's eat.

348
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:52,880
Wait a minute, Ten-kun.

349
00:18:57,880 --> 00:18:59,880
Let's eat.

350
00:18:59,880 --> 00:19:04,880
Let's eat.

351
00:19:06,874 --> 00:19:08,874
Put the sauce on it.

352
00:19:09,874 --> 00:19:11,874
It looks delicious.

353
00:19:11,874 --> 00:19:12,874
Let's eat.

354
00:19:12,874 --> 00:19:18,298
It's delicious.

355
00:19:18,298 --> 00:19:20,298
The egg is fluffy

356
00:19:20,298 --> 00:19:22,298
It melts in your mouth

357
00:19:22,298 --> 00:19:25,298
It goes well with Hayashi rice

358
00:19:25,298 --> 00:19:27,298
Hayashi rice

359
00:19:27,298 --> 00:19:30,298
Nagayama-san, you ate it but you haven't
said your impression yet

360
00:19:30,298 --> 00:19:32,298
It's only Hayashi rice

361
00:19:32,298 --> 00:19:36,298
Yes, the rice is white

362
00:19:36,298 --> 00:19:38,298
What is it?

363
00:19:38,298 --> 00:19:41,298
This rice is so cute

364
00:19:41,298 --> 00:19:44,298
Then, Ten-kun, shall we eat it too?

365
00:19:44,298 --> 00:19:45,298
Then, I

366
00:19:45,298 --> 00:19:49,298
I have something recommended for you

367
00:19:49,298 --> 00:19:53,298
Then, please recommend it

368
00:19:53,298 --> 00:19:55,298
Thank you

369
00:19:55,298 --> 00:19:57,298
What happened?

370
00:19:57,298 --> 00:19:59,298
Did you order something recommended?

371
00:19:59,298 --> 00:20:04,298
I ordered another recommended product

372
00:20:04,298 --> 00:20:08,298
Then, another one will come, so let's
eat it together

373
00:20:08,298 --> 00:20:09,298
Wait

374
00:20:09,298 --> 00:20:10,298
Eat together?

375
00:20:10,298 --> 00:20:11,298
Eat together?

376
00:20:11,298 --> 00:20:13,298
What is it?

377
00:20:13,298 --> 00:20:18,298
Ten-kun is a dog, so he can't eat human
food

378
00:20:18,298 --> 00:20:21,024
Please watch again.

379
00:20:21,024 --> 00:20:24,024
Why? Why?

380
00:20:24,024 --> 00:20:28,024
After this, the truth of Nakayama's
scream is clearly...

381
00:20:30,024 --> 00:20:33,024
I'll have another one, so let's eat
together.

382
00:20:33,024 --> 00:20:35,024
Can you eat together?

383
00:20:35,024 --> 00:20:37,024
I can eat together.

384
00:20:37,024 --> 00:20:39,024
What is it?

385
00:20:39,024 --> 00:20:43,024
Ten-kun is a dog, so he can't eat human
food.

386
00:20:43,024 --> 00:20:45,024
That's right.

387
00:20:45,024 --> 00:20:48,024
Why? Why? Why?

388
00:20:48,024 --> 00:20:50,074
Why?

389
00:20:50,074 --> 00:20:52,074
Spicy

390
00:20:52,074 --> 00:20:54,074
Thank you

391
00:20:54,074 --> 00:20:56,074
Thank you

392
00:20:56,074 --> 00:20:58,074
Wait a minute

393
00:20:58,074 --> 00:21:00,074
Sorry Ten-kun

394
00:21:00,074 --> 00:21:04,074
He is the teacher of the interview that
I took care of before

395
00:21:04,074 --> 00:21:07,074
Actually this man

396
00:21:07,074 --> 00:21:11,104
Welcome to Smile Cafe

397
00:21:11,104 --> 00:21:14,104
That's all for today's interview

398
00:21:14,104 --> 00:21:16,104
Thank you

399
00:21:16,104 --> 00:21:22,104
Last year, the interviewer tried to
knock out Nakayama

400
00:21:22,104 --> 00:21:25,104
What happened to Nakayama?

401
00:21:25,104 --> 00:21:28,104
I can't do this

402
00:21:28,104 --> 00:21:34,104
Nakayama's enemy has changed to the
manager

403
00:21:34,104 --> 00:21:39,472
What will happen to Nakayama?

404
00:21:39,472 --> 00:21:45,472
Enichu Game Quest

405
00:21:45,808 --> 00:21:49,808
Enichu Game Quest, which started last
year

406
00:21:49,808 --> 00:21:51,808
The game is finally complete!

407
00:21:51,808 --> 00:21:55,808
The release date is set for May 27th

408
00:21:55,808 --> 00:22:00,808
This time, the Enichu members will
challenge the battle part

409
00:22:01,808 --> 00:22:04,808
In the battle part, pull the ball like
this

410
00:22:04,808 --> 00:22:11,104
And then, fire the pin in the center of
the screen

411
00:22:11,104 --> 00:22:15,104
The number of pins dropped will be
damaged and the enemy will be defeated.

412
00:22:17,104 --> 00:22:21,104
When you fire the bullets, the angle of
launch is important.

413
00:22:23,104 --> 00:22:28,104
The point is to adjust the angle to drop
more pins.

414
00:22:28,104 --> 00:22:38,096
This time, we will have a time attack to
see who can defeat the enemy first.

415
00:22:38,096 --> 00:22:40,096
First, Hirota's challenge.

416
00:22:41,096 --> 00:22:44,096
The angle is different.

417
00:22:45,096 --> 00:22:47,096
Which one should I use?

418
00:22:49,096 --> 00:22:50,096
This one! This one!

419
00:22:50,096 --> 00:22:52,096
I got it! I got it!

420
00:22:54,096 --> 00:22:57,096
Hirota has adjusted the angle of launch
well.

421
00:22:57,096 --> 00:23:00,096
She has succeeded in dropping many pins.

422
00:23:00,096 --> 00:23:03,096
I feel like I can do it until I get used
to it.

423
00:23:03,096 --> 00:23:04,096
It's not easy.

424
00:23:04,096 --> 00:23:05,096
It's close.

425
00:23:05,096 --> 00:23:06,096
It's different.

426
00:23:06,096 --> 00:23:07,096
This is it.

427
00:23:07,096 --> 00:23:11,096
After that, Hirota has a hard time
adjusting the angle.

428
00:23:11,096 --> 00:23:16,794
Continued from next time.

429
00:23:16,794 --> 00:23:18,794
This is bad.

430
00:23:18,794 --> 00:23:20,794
This is bad.

431
00:23:20,794 --> 00:23:22,794
Go, go, go.

432
00:23:22,794 --> 00:23:26,794
If you don't get the last turn, you
can't finish the game.

433
00:23:26,794 --> 00:23:28,794
You can't aim?

434
00:23:28,794 --> 00:23:30,794
The direction is bad.

435
00:23:30,794 --> 00:23:33,794
In the end, Hirota's record is 3 minutes
and 22 seconds.

436
00:23:34,794 --> 00:23:39,794
Hoshina and Kobayashi did a good job and
surpassed Hirota.

437
00:23:40,794 --> 00:23:44,794
The last is the most difficult game,
Mayama's challenge.

438
00:23:44,794 --> 00:23:46,794
I don't know.

439
00:23:48,896 --> 00:23:53,936
This technique is useful because you can
stop its roll and stop it as you Royal還
potential.

440
00:23:55,296 --> 00:23:56,816
Can you watch the top-left?

441
00:23:57,056 --> 00:23:58,856
Oh, I can go after it.

442
00:23:59,496 --> 00:24:00,336
Really?

443
00:24:01,976 --> 00:24:03,096
R grandmother's R hey

444
00:24:07,456 --> 00:24:08,656
Oh

445
00:24:08,656 --> 00:24:10,656
巴掌

446
00:24:10,656 --> 00:24:12,656
That was amazing!

447
00:24:13,754 --> 00:24:17,754
The result is...

448
00:24:17,754 --> 00:24:20,754
1st place is Mayama-san.

449
00:24:20,754 --> 00:24:22,754
That's great!

450
00:24:22,754 --> 00:24:25,754
I said I only pull the card.

451
00:24:25,754 --> 00:24:28,754
But surprisingly, I pulled the card.

452
00:24:28,754 --> 00:24:30,754
I want to know more about it.

453
00:24:30,754 --> 00:24:32,754
I want to know more about it.

454
00:24:32,754 --> 00:24:37,754
The game called Ebitune will be released
on May 27th.

455
00:24:37,754 --> 00:24:41,754
It's currently being pre-registered for
the fans.

456
00:24:41,754 --> 00:24:45,754
The number of items you can get depends
on the number of pre-registered players.

457
00:24:45,754 --> 00:24:48,754
For more information, please visit
Stardust Channel.

458
00:24:48,754 --> 00:24:51,754
Next time, we'll have a reporter battle.

459
00:24:51,754 --> 00:24:53,754
The two free-spirited players will be
playing.

460
00:24:53,754 --> 00:24:55,754
Is it good?

461
00:24:55,754 --> 00:24:56,754
Yes.

462
00:24:56,754 --> 00:25:00,754
And Mayama, the super gourmet, will be
reporting.

463
00:25:00,754 --> 00:25:02,754
I've been chosen.

464
00:25:02,754 --> 00:25:00,394
Nakayama and the manager's battle of

465
00:25:00,394 --> 00:25:09,312
I've been chosen. Nakayama and the
manager's battle of

466
00:25:09,312 --> 00:25:16,912
