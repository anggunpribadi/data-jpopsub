00:53.330 --> 00:55.330

 You can run away, you can run away

02:59.082 --> 03:03.082
 The game has begun

03:03.082 --> 03:06.082
 And it's not the end yet

03:06.082 --> 03:08.768
 Yes, yes.

03:08.768 --> 03:12.768
 The sun is disappearing into the crowd

03:12.768 --> 03:16.768
 It's the worst to look down from the
side

03:16.768 --> 03:22.768
 Is it too late now?

03:22.768 --> 03:24.768

 2 days before the actual live

04:41.010 --> 04:42.010
 Yes.

04:42.010 --> 04:44.010
 How was it?

04:47.010 --> 04:48.010
 It was good.

04:48.010 --> 04:54.234
 Please subscribe to our channel.

04:54.234 --> 04:58.234
 Thank you very much.

05:06.528 --> 05:08.528
 It was so wide.

05:08.528 --> 05:10.528
 The first floor was so wide.

05:27.528 --> 05:29.528
 I'm watching you.

05:31.528 --> 05:33.528
 Today is lunch time.

05:33.528 --> 05:37.528
 We are going to have an opening
performance.

05:38.528 --> 05:40.528
 I'm so nervous.

05:40.528 --> 05:41.528
 Are you OK?

05:41.528 --> 05:43.528
 I'm nervous.

05:43.528 --> 05:44.528
 I'm nervous, too.

05:44.528 --> 05:50.528
 I borrowed Toki-sen-chan's costume.

05:53.528 --> 05:57.528
 I don't know if I can wear it in the
morning, so I tried it on.

05:57.528 --> 06:01.528
 It was totally different from what
Toki-sen-chan wore.

06:01.528 --> 06:03.528
 I can't wear it.

06:03.528 --> 06:04.528
 Are you OK?

06:04.528 --> 06:06.528
 I'm not wearing it.

06:06.528 --> 06:08.528
 I'm wearing pink.

06:08.528 --> 06:10.528
 Right.

06:10.528 --> 06:12.528
 I'm always wearing purple.

06:15.544 --> 06:17.544
 I was wondering about that costume.

06:17.544 --> 06:19.544
 When everyone was wearing purple.

06:19.544 --> 06:21.544
 When we were in the arena.

06:25.544 --> 06:27.544
 It's a cute costume.

06:27.544 --> 06:29.544
 I'm looking forward to it.

06:29.544 --> 06:34.544
 We'll do our best.

06:37.936 --> 06:39.936
 5,000 yen.

06:39.936 --> 06:41.936
 5,000 yen?

06:41.936 --> 06:43.936
 Yes.

06:43.936 --> 06:45.936
 Thank you.

06:45.936 --> 06:47.936
 Thank you.

06:55.834 --> 07:00.834
 Next, Hiori, Julia, and...

07:00.834 --> 07:05.834
 Julia will be with Rin-chan, and we'll
have a dance time.

07:05.834 --> 07:08.834
 We'll do a rehearsal.

07:08.834 --> 07:11.834
 We'll start the rehearsal.

07:11.834 --> 07:13.834
 Thank you.

07:24.442 --> 07:26.442
 I'm wearing the costume of Haru.

07:30.442 --> 07:34.442
 I was told that I was going to wear the
costume of Hitomi, but I said thank you.

07:39.442 --> 07:41.442
 We are TimeTimes.

07:41.442 --> 07:44.442
 Thank you.

07:44.442 --> 07:55.066
 Please subscribe to my channel.

07:55.066 --> 07:59.066
 I've come to like you

07:59.066 --> 08:05.066
 The popular feeling, love, will
eventually turn into love

08:05.066 --> 08:09.066
 It's complicated, but it's simple

08:09.066 --> 08:17.344
 I love you

08:17.344 --> 08:18.344

10:19.312 --> 10:21.312
 You will fall down.

10:21.312 --> 10:23.312
 Please pretend to be strong.

10:23.312 --> 10:25.312
 Put your hands on your hair.

10:25.312 --> 10:28.312
 You should be close to the white
curtain.

10:28.312 --> 10:31.312
 You should be close to it.

10:31.312 --> 10:33.312
 You can't do it.

 Shabu-shabu. It's healthy.

11:49.144 --> 11:51.144
 I'm going to put it in the mirror.

11:51.144 --> 11:57.144
 I chose the Salaspa steak from Abeli
Wagyu.

11:57.144 --> 11:59.144
 The meat is...

12:01.144 --> 12:03.144
 Oh, it's the same steak.

12:03.144 --> 12:05.144
 The same steak.

Rina

12:20.678 --> 12:24.138
 will perform during lunch break.

12:24.278 --> 12:30.118
 It's judgement-based on which singer
will sing the song.

12:31.978 --> 12:34.478
 Ayaka wants to do a great example.

12:36.598 --> 12:38.258
 strawberries

12:38.258 --> 12:40.258
 You look beautiful!

 I'm embarrassed.

13:01.050 --> 13:12.050
 I'm nervous.

13:12.122 --> 13:20.122
 Santa never give up.

13:28.992 --> 13:33.992
 If you're done, you can go change.

14:43.246 --> 14:45.246
 I'm the leader of NANCHI TIME.

14:45.246 --> 14:46.606
 Oh, really?

 Let's do it

15:17.240 --> 15:18.240
 Before the show

15:18.240 --> 15:19.240
 Before the show?

 Now?

15:20.240 --> 15:21.240

 Don't talk!

15:54.586 --> 15:58.486
 WHats the situation now side back?

15:58.486 --> 16:00.926
 I'm a clever girl.

16:05.526 --> 16:06.846
 Can people see it already?

16:08.566 --> 16:12.246
 The fog took a lot.

16:12.246 --> 16:13.726
 I'm worried that those people see.

16:21.184 --> 16:23.184

17:44.800 --> 17:47.800
 Believe in love

17:47.800 --> 17:49.800
 I know, but I'm a little dizzy

17:49.800 --> 17:52.800
 Sometimes I write a letter

17:52.800 --> 17:56.800
 Promise me your true love

 Forever by my side

 I'm sure it's okay

18:01.800 --> 18:04.800
 I'm sorry, I'm not saying anything

18:04.800 --> 18:06.800
 I really don't like this

18:06.800 --> 18:07.800
 I don't want to hear it

18:07.800 --> 18:14.800
 I don't want to hear it

18:14.800 --> 18:20.800
 I don't want to hear this feeling

21:16.090 --> 21:18.090
 Thank you very much.

21:27.674 --> 21:31.674
 Thank you for your hard work.

21:31.674 --> 21:33.674
 I was so scared!

21:34.352 --> 21:36.352
 Thank you for the prize!

21:38.352 --> 21:40.352
 It was fun!

21:40.352 --> 21:42.352
 It looked like fun!

21:42.352 --> 21:46.352
 When we were skiing, everyone was
holding the camera

21:46.352 --> 21:48.352
 and I was like, oh yeah, we're going to
be filmed!

21:51.352 --> 21:53.352
 It was so much fun!

21:54.352 --> 21:55.352
 It was so cute!

21:55.352 --> 21:59.352
 We danced hoping that we would get more
fans,

21:59.352 --> 22:03.352
 and we should have gotten more fans!

22:21.536 --> 22:23.536
 It was fun.

22:28.536 --> 22:30.536
 I'm looking forward to it.

22:39.536 --> 22:41.536
 Congratulations.

22:41.536 --> 22:44.602
 Thank you for watching.

22:44.602 --> 22:47.602
 I don't know what to say next.

22:47.602 --> 22:50.602
 I have to hurry up.

22:55.602 --> 22:58.602
 Next, the super-exciting voice actors!

22:58.602 --> 23:01.602
 Thank you!

23:01.602 --> 23:13.602
 Let's have fun with everyone here and
everyone watching the live broadcast!

23:14.840 --> 23:16.840
 On Paribaru 2021 Start!

23:16.840 --> 23:19.840
 The opening has ended!

23:20.144 --> 23:25.144
 We are now at lunchtime!

23:27.144 --> 23:30.144
 It's our first lunchtime show!

23:30.144 --> 23:32.144
 Oh, wait, wait.

23:32.144 --> 23:35.144
 Let's start with Reni-chan.

23:35.144 --> 23:39.144
 Sorry, let's start with Reni-chan.

23:39.144 --> 23:51.144
 It was our first time to be in a group
other than Momokuro.

23:51.144 --> 23:54.144
 And we were able to do a pose for
lunchtime.

23:54.144 --> 23:57.144
 We were also able to be appointed as
the leader of Hiori.

23:57.144 --> 24:00.144
 It's been a while since we did that.

24:00.144 --> 24:04.144
 I really love Toki-chan.

24:04.144 --> 24:07.144
 I'm so happy that my dream came true.

24:07.144 --> 24:10.144
 I wonder if I can be with Reni-chan.

24:10.144 --> 24:16.144
 When I watch the rehearsal video with
Reni-chan at home,

24:16.144 --> 24:18.144
 I feel like, oh, it's Reni-chan.

24:18.144 --> 24:21.144
 It's a strange feeling.

24:21.144 --> 24:24.144
 I'm so happy that it's amazing.

24:24.144 --> 24:27.144
 I'm so happy that I can be with her.

24:28.408 --> 24:30.408
 I want to say that.

24:30.408 --> 24:35.408
 I saw the rehearsal video, and I was
surprised at the two of us.

24:35.408 --> 24:39.408
 I can't remember my position at all.

24:39.408 --> 24:41.408
 If I say this, my teacher will get
angry.

24:41.408 --> 24:43.408
 I don't remember at all.

24:43.408 --> 24:47.408
 I think I have to remember, but I'm
going to be with her.

24:47.408 --> 24:49.408
 I was so happy.

24:49.408 --> 24:51.408
 I'm so happy.

24:52.568 --> 24:54.568
 Everyone is so excited.

24:54.568 --> 24:58.568
 We can shoot when we want.

24:59.568 --> 25:02.568
 Everyone is holding the camera.

25:03.568 --> 25:07.568
 Please spread the word about us.

25:08.568 --> 25:10.568
 Thank you.

25:10.568 --> 25:19.568
 I borrowed the costume for this
shooting.

25:20.936 --> 25:21.936
 Thank you, Haru-chan.

25:21.936 --> 25:24.936
 Thank you, too.

25:24.936 --> 25:27.936
 You said, I borrowed the costume for
this shooting.

25:27.936 --> 25:29.936
 Thank you so much.

25:29.936 --> 25:34.936
 I couldn't choose the costume for the
song.

25:34.936 --> 25:36.936
 I was asked what kind of costume I
should wear.

25:36.936 --> 25:39.936
 And I found Hishin-chan's costume was
so cute.

25:39.936 --> 25:43.936
 I'm a big fan of her.

25:43.936 --> 25:45.936
 I wanted to wear this costume.

25:45.936 --> 25:58.936
 I thought I couldn't wear this costume.

25:58.936 --> 26:00.936
 I was so nervous.

26:00.936 --> 26:04.064
 I'm a big fan of Haru-chan.

26:05.064 --> 26:10.064
 I think I've proven that Tokisen-chan
is cute.

26:13.064 --> 26:15.064
 I'm so happy.

26:17.064 --> 26:19.064
 We're happy, too.

26:22.064 --> 26:29.064
 I'm really selfish in this way, but I
want to do more in lunch time.

26:29.064 --> 26:31.064
 I want to collaborate with Tokisen-
chan.

26:31.064 --> 26:33.064
 I want to collaborate with everyone.

26:38.064 --> 26:40.064
 Please, adults.

26:43.064 --> 26:46.064
 We're going to prepare for it soon.

26:46.064 --> 26:48.064
 I'll help you with anything.

26:51.064 --> 26:55.064
 I like YouTube, so I want to do a
commercial with Aki-chan.

26:55.064 --> 27:00.064
 I like the commercial for goods.

27:01.064 --> 27:03.064
 I'm so happy.

27:04.064 --> 27:06.064
 I'm so happy.

27:09.064 --> 27:11.064
 It's a heart-to-heart series.

27:14.064 --> 27:16.064
 I'm so happy.

27:18.064 --> 27:20.064
 I'm so happy.

27:21.064 --> 27:23.064
 I hope we can get along well.

27:23.064 --> 27:25.064
 I'm so happy.

27:29.064 --> 27:31.064
 Thank you for coming.

27:38.064 --> 27:40.064
 I'm a commentator.

27:40.064 --> 27:42.064
 I'm a commentator.

27:43.064 --> 27:45.064
 I'm a commentator.

27:47.064 --> 27:49.064
 I'm going to eat this.

27:49.064 --> 27:52.064
 It looks delicious.

27:52.064 --> 27:54.064
 I'm going to eat this.

27:56.064 --> 27:58.064
 It looks really good.

27:58.064 --> 28:00.064
 It's cute.

28:01.064 --> 28:03.064
 Look at this.

28:04.064 --> 28:06.064
 My pinky is standing.

28:06.064 --> 28:08.064
 It's standing.

28:08.064 --> 28:12.784
 It's been standing for a long time.

28:13.784 --> 28:14.784
 How is it?

28:15.784 --> 28:16.784
 It's good.

28:18.784 --> 28:19.784
 Is it good?

28:21.784 --> 28:22.784
 It's good.

28:23.784 --> 28:24.784
 It's good.

28:26.784 --> 28:28.784
 I can't say anything but it's good.

28:28.784 --> 28:30.784
 I'm so excited.

28:30.784 --> 28:31.784
 It's really good.

28:40.368 --> 28:42.368
 It's so fun, isn't it?

28:42.368 --> 28:44.368
 It's so fun!

28:45.368 --> 28:47.368
 It's so short!

28:47.368 --> 28:49.368
 It's so fun!

28:49.368 --> 28:51.098
 It's so short!

28:51.098 --> 28:53.098
 It is not like you're a big boss right?

28:53.098 --> 28:54.738
 That is sort of like...

28:54.758 --> 28:56.758
 Because that monokuma who buried on the
floor

28:57.218 --> 28:58.218
 Oh so you're like this

28:59.678 --> 29:01.678
 Despite everyone's disagreement

29:03.718 --> 29:09.118
 An unaaaable

29:09.118 --> 29:10.978
 Here we go!

29:18.624 --> 29:24.624
 So, we are starting Hayakamibara 2020
now.

29:24.624 --> 29:26.624
 Good job, Julia!

29:26.624 --> 29:27.624
 Thank you!

29:27.624 --> 29:28.624
 Lunch time!

29:28.624 --> 29:33.624
 We will take a break and do the opening
act.

29:33.624 --> 29:37.624
 We will have our performance soon.

29:37.624 --> 29:38.624
 Yes!

29:38.624 --> 29:40.624
 We are so grateful.

29:40.624 --> 29:43.624
 We have been working for 30 minutes.

29:43.624 --> 29:48.624
 We will perform with ARIN.

29:48.624 --> 29:50.624
 Are you happy?

29:50.624 --> 29:53.624
 When we performed the opening act,

29:53.624 --> 29:57.624
 we were so happy to have a lot of fans.

29:57.624 --> 29:59.624
 We are so happy.

29:59.624 --> 30:01.624
 Thank you!

30:01.624 --> 30:04.624
 I can say this because it will be
announced.

30:04.624 --> 30:09.624
 I don't know what kind of clothes ARIN
will wear at this stage.

30:09.624 --> 30:10.624
 I don't know.

30:10.624 --> 30:12.624
 I'm looking forward to it.

30:12.624 --> 30:15.624
 We prepared a lot of shoes.

30:15.624 --> 30:17.624
 The design is different.

30:17.624 --> 30:19.624
 We have almost the same shoes.

30:22.624 --> 30:24.624
 I'm not complaining.

30:24.624 --> 30:28.624
 We have a few types, but we haven't
decided which one to wear.

30:28.624 --> 30:31.624
 I want to wear more shoes.

30:31.624 --> 30:34.624
 It's easy to take pictures if you wear
them.

30:34.624 --> 30:35.624
 So, I'll leave them.

30:35.624 --> 30:39.624
 I'm looking forward to seeing what ARIN
will wear.

30:39.624 --> 30:45.624
 We will choose cute and fluttering
clothes for the rehearsal.

30:45.624 --> 30:51.120
 I'm looking forward to seeing what it
will be like.

30:51.120 --> 30:54.120
 We'll do our best!

30:55.984 --> 30:58.984
 We're going to perform at the Tokyo
Dome!

30:58.984 --> 30:59.984
 We're going to perform at the Tokyo
Dome!

30:59.984 --> 31:01.984
 I'm so excited!

31:01.984 --> 31:05.984
 We've been waiting for this moment for
25 minutes.

31:05.984 --> 31:07.984
 I'm so excited.

31:07.984 --> 31:13.984
 We've been waiting for this moment for
25 minutes.

31:13.984 --> 31:18.984
 We've been saying that we want to
perform at the Tokyo Dome.

31:18.984 --> 31:21.984
 But we've never performed at the Tokyo
Dome.

31:21.984 --> 31:27.984
 We'll show you how great the Budokan
is.

31:27.984 --> 31:31.984
 We'll do our best to show you our
performance.

31:31.984 --> 31:35.984
 We'll do our best to show you our
performance.

31:35.984 --> 31:38.984
 We'll make this place a promotional
venue.

31:38.984 --> 31:40.984
 We'll do it!

31:40.984 --> 31:44.984
 We were a bit nervous during the
rehearsal.

31:44.984 --> 31:46.984
 We did it!

31:46.984 --> 31:52.984
 We're aiming for this place.

31:52.984 --> 32:00.984
 We'll do our best to get closer to the
Tokyo Dome.

32:00.984 --> 32:05.984
 There are many people wearing T-shirts.

32:05.984 --> 32:07.984
 Thank you.

32:07.984 --> 32:09.984
 Let's enjoy it!

32:09.984 --> 32:13.600
 Let's enjoy it!

32:14.600 --> 32:17.600
 It's starting!

32:17.600 --> 32:19.600
 Let's go!

32:37.626 --> 32:39.626
 I'm having fun.

32:54.016 --> 32:54.476
 Size changes to increase speed

32:56.176 --> 32:57.356
 Is it serious?

32:59.376 --> 33:00.076
 2 o'clock

33:01.636 --> 33:02.776
 This is normal

33:07.856 --> 33:11.936
 The last

33:13.096 --> 33:14.576
 The sis we noticed

33:14.576 --> 33:26.266
 Thanks for watching!

33:27.226 --> 33:28.826
 Shine

33:28.826 --> 33:29.826
 Yeah

33:30.706 --> 33:31.706
 Come on

33:31.866 --> 33:32.866
 Come on

33:34.866 --> 33:36.186
 One more time

33:40.826 --> 33:41.566
 One, two ~!

33:42.926 --> 33:44.146
 stage

33:44.666 --> 33:45.806
 The final stop

33:45.806 --> 33:47.806
 Thank you for watching.

33:48.218 --> 33:56.338
 The hair has started to fall down.

34:00.638 --> 34:04.138
 Everyone is completely amino acid.

34:04.238 --> 34:09.298
 Mukai-san decided to sleep in one car
at the gospel house.

34:09.298 --> 34:18.338
 We'll keep filming CDs of festivals.

34:25.594 --> 34:27.594
 All together now!!

34:27.594 --> 34:29.594
 Go! Go! Go! Go! Go!

34:29.594 --> 34:31.594
 Together forever!!

34:31.594 --> 34:33.594
 Go! Go! Go! Go! Go!

34:33.594 --> 34:35.568
 Thank you for watching!

34:35.568 --> 34:38.068
 Mission No.1

34:38.068 --> 34:41.068
 A little rusty street light

34:41.068 --> 34:45.068
 The heart's heartbeat when we meet

34:45.068 --> 34:50.568
 I can't hear your voice, right?

34:50.568 --> 34:52.568
 Ah...

34:52.568 --> 34:55.568
 Next year's town

34:55.568 --> 35:00.068
 I won't let go of your hand

35:00.068 --> 35:05.568
 Is it too late to say goodbye?

35:05.568 --> 35:09.568
 In July, I'll spend time with you

35:09.568 --> 35:12.568
 I'm still, still, still not ready

35:12.568 --> 35:14.568
 Please tell me

35:14.568 --> 35:21.068
 I'm still in love with you

35:21.562 --> 35:27.562
 I feel like I can be confident

35:27.562 --> 35:33.562
 Because I want to like you

35:33.562 --> 35:39.562
 I want to be able to feel that feeling

35:39.562 --> 35:43.562
 I would like to sing together with
someone

35:43.562 --> 35:45.562
 Ready?

35:45.562 --> 35:48.562
 A-mi

35:48.562 --> 35:50.562
 Wow!

35:50.562 --> 35:52.570
 I love you!

35:52.570 --> 35:54.570
 Wow!

35:56.986 --> 35:57.986
 I'll wear it!

35:57.986 --> 35:58.986
 So cute!

35:59.986 --> 36:01.986
 I've been wearing the same one as
everyone.

36:02.986 --> 36:03.986
 Thank you!

36:03.986 --> 36:04.986
 So cute!

36:05.986 --> 36:09.986
 I've chosen the shortest skirt among
all the clothes I have.

36:09.986 --> 36:10.986
 Thank you!

36:10.986 --> 36:11.986
 Because everyone's skirts are short.

36:11.986 --> 36:12.986
 I'm so happy!

36:12.986 --> 36:15.986
 But I'm not that old, so I'm not that
hungry.

36:15.986 --> 36:23.986
 I've been trying to fit everyone's
size.

36:33.408 --> 36:38.808
 I'll keep running, even if my strings
come undone

36:38.808 --> 36:41.008
 My heart is pounding

36:41.008 --> 36:44.008
 Did you all get a rock on from us?

36:45.608 --> 36:47.008
 Thank you very much!

36:47.408 --> 36:52.408
 We'll be back at the Budokan as a super
special event, so please wait for us!

36:52.808 --> 36:53.608
 Well then,

37:58.320 --> 38:01.320
 I heard the song of Gorilla Punch.

38:02.320 --> 38:04.320
 Who is Gorilla?

38:06.320 --> 38:08.320

38:17.320 --> 38:20.320
 I'm a gorilla with a sharp tail.

38:21.320 --> 38:24.320
 The first cut is amazing.

38:25.320 --> 38:27.320

39:13.242 --> 39:16.242
 Sparkling dreams and pins

39:16.242 --> 39:19.242
 We're dancing in the sun

39:40.462 --> 39:42.842
 I can't wash this.

 I'm so high, leave it to me!

39:46.432 --> 39:48.432
 Let's go!

39:48.432 --> 39:50.432
 So,

39:50.432 --> 39:52.432

 Each of us has our name on it.

 Everyone's name is on it.

40:10.432 --> 40:12.432
 Oh, Konomi.

40:12.432 --> 40:14.266
 The name is on the front.

40:14.266 --> 40:15.746
 but it should be okay.

40:15.746 --> 40:21.986
 Communicating period

40:22.486 --> 40:27.506

40:27.506 --> 40:32.986
 Meca

 Black.

41:41.874 --> 41:42.874
 No, it's not.

41:42.874 --> 41:44.874
 It's a little bit black.

41:44.874 --> 41:45.874
 It's me.

 We sang the opening song together, and
we danced to the chorus of the song.

42:14.816 --> 42:21.816
 We danced for 25 minutes at the live

 We are a group with a long history.

42:59.816 --> 43:01.816
 We just started to work.

43:02.816 --> 43:05.816
 The leader is the national treasure.

43:06.816 --> 43:12.816
 I got a letter from RENI saying that I
want to do it again.

43:13.816 --> 43:14.816

44:04.816 --> 44:11.816
 Bye bye.

44:13.584 --> 44:17.584
 The world is shining

44:17.584 --> 44:21.584
 I can be relaxed by turning the
umbrella

44:21.584 --> 44:25.584
 If not, I can't walk

44:25.584 --> 44:28.584
 Surely, someone is crying somewhere

44:28.584 --> 44:30.584
 I'll get wet somewhere again

44:30.584 --> 44:33.584
 It's not cold

44:33.584 --> 44:36.584
 Surely, someone is crying somewhere

44:36.890 --> 44:42.290
 I want to share my feelings with you

44:42.290 --> 44:47.090
 The scenery that I don't know is still
in front of me

44:47.090 --> 44:50.490
 Let's go anywhere

44:53.490 --> 44:55.490
 Goodbye, goodbye

44:55.490 --> 44:57.490
 Thank you for yesterday

44:57.490 --> 44:59.674
 It's a city after the rain

44:59.674 --> 45:05.674
 I'll draw a fragment of the future on
the canvas of my damaged heart

45:05.674 --> 45:23.642
 I'll draw a fragment of the future on
the canvas of my damaged heart

 The city after the rain is sparkling

46:07.752 --> 46:09.752
 My heart is like a flower

46:09.752 --> 46:11.752
 I shed tears

46:11.752 --> 46:34.752
 I wear a rainbow dress
