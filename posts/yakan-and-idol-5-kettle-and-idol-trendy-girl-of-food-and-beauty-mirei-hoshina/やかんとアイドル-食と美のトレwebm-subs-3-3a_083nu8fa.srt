1
00:00:01,562 --> 00:00:03,562
YAKANT IDOL!

2
00:00:03,562 --> 00:00:07,562
It's a fast ending!

3
00:00:07,562 --> 00:00:10,736
Please let us know!

4
00:00:10,736 --> 00:00:21,536
The Rino-kuni Thank You Festival, which
was held in Akita, Chiritsu, Ebisu, and
Akita branch, will be held on November
26th at the Akita Art Theater Miruhasu
Daihou.

5
00:00:21,536 --> 00:00:23,316
And there are more.

6
00:00:23,316 --> 00:00:26,816
There will be two days of live
performances at the Makuhari Messe event
hall.

7
00:00:26,816 --> 00:00:31,176
On December 16th, there will be a
graduation ceremony for Hina Hashiaki
and Smile for You.

8
00:00:31,176 --> 00:00:38,816
And on December 17th, there will be a
new style university art festival, Learn
in Our Ebisu Family.

9
00:00:38,816 --> 00:00:48,016
And on January 14th, 2023, we will be
performing at the TsutaPla Idol Festival
in Yokohama Arena.

10
00:00:48,016 --> 00:00:52,296
There will be a lot of live
performances, so please come and have
fun!

11
00:00:52,296 --> 00:00:53,536
I see.

12
00:00:53,536 --> 00:00:56,336
How many years has it been since you
last went to Akita?

13
00:00:56,336 --> 00:00:58,056
I wonder why we went there.

14
00:00:58,056 --> 00:01:00,256
It's amazing.

15
00:01:00,256 --> 00:01:04,696
The people of Akita are very happy.

16
00:01:04,696 --> 00:01:08,136
Maybe Akita is more famous than Tokyo.

17
00:01:08,136 --> 00:01:09,576
That's not true.

18
00:01:09,576 --> 00:01:11,576
It's weird to say that's not true.

19
00:01:11,576 --> 00:01:15,136
Akita's station is very famous for
shrimp chou.

20
00:01:15,136 --> 00:01:16,136
That's right.

21
00:01:16,136 --> 00:01:17,536
It's famous for its view.

22
00:01:17,536 --> 00:01:19,696
So when I go to Akita for a location,
people say,

23
00:01:19,696 --> 00:01:21,856
Oh, shrimp chou!

24
00:01:21,856 --> 00:01:23,136
But in Tokyo, it's not like that.

25
00:01:23,136 --> 00:01:25,256
That's not true.

26
00:01:25,256 --> 00:01:27,136
When did you become so self-centered?

27
00:01:27,136 --> 00:01:29,976
But people of Akita are really happy.

28
00:01:29,976 --> 00:01:31,656
Thank you very much.

29
00:01:31,656 --> 00:01:35,416
They said they were happy to see us
every time.

30
00:01:35,416 --> 00:01:37,176
So please look forward to it.

31
00:01:37,176 --> 00:01:41,816
And finally, there's the graduation
ceremony for KASHIHAGI.

32
00:01:41,816 --> 00:01:47,016
Do you have any memories of graduation?

33
00:01:47,016 --> 00:01:47,936
I'm sad.

34
00:01:47,936 --> 00:01:49,296
I talked about it in detail.

35
00:01:49,296 --> 00:01:50,096
Did you?

36
00:01:50,096 --> 00:01:51,616
I ate grilled meat and French fries
while saying,

37
00:01:51,616 --> 00:01:53,336
Why do you quit?

38
00:01:53,336 --> 00:01:55,216
That's nice.

39
00:01:55,216 --> 00:01:58,296
With all the big sister groups.

40
00:01:58,296 --> 00:02:01,536
We've been together since we were
little.

41
00:02:01,536 --> 00:02:02,976
No, no, no.

42
00:02:02,976 --> 00:02:07,456
This is probably a new shape from the
next day.

43
00:02:07,456 --> 00:02:08,776
Is that what it means?

44
00:02:08,776 --> 00:02:14,496
I graduated from KASHIHAGI and became a
shrimp chou for 10 people.

45
00:02:14,496 --> 00:02:16,576
And next year, January 14th,

46
00:02:16,576 --> 00:02:19,136
It's called the Star Pla Idol Fest.

47
00:02:19,136 --> 00:02:22,656
I got to do it with the Japanese prince
at Star Pla.

48
00:02:22,656 --> 00:02:24,336
Maybe this time, the group.

49
00:02:24,336 --> 00:02:28,136
The group's victory.

50
00:02:28,136 --> 00:02:30,456
Was it better not to tell you now?

51
00:02:30,456 --> 00:02:31,416
You're announcing it, aren't you?

52
00:02:31,416 --> 00:02:33,496
I've been hearing a lot from Rika.

53
00:02:33,496 --> 00:02:34,336
Oh, really?

54
00:02:34,336 --> 00:02:36,616
It's like a sports day.

55
00:02:36,616 --> 00:02:38,616
You can't eat spicy food.

56
00:02:38,616 --> 00:02:40,776
You should have a competition for Mirei.

57
00:02:40,776 --> 00:02:42,176
Oh, should I have her compete?

58
00:02:42,176 --> 00:02:43,456
It's a quick victory.

59
00:02:43,456 --> 00:02:43,976
It's a quick victory.

60
00:02:43,976 --> 00:02:44,656
I don't know.

61
00:02:44,656 --> 00:02:45,656
Reni-chan, Reni-chan.

62
00:02:45,656 --> 00:02:48,376
This is a fake, Takagi-san.

63
00:02:48,376 --> 00:02:49,376
You can do it.

64
00:02:49,376 --> 00:02:51,136
You can still do that.

65
00:02:51,136 --> 00:02:54,608
What else is Mirei good at?

66
00:02:54,608 --> 00:02:56,608
I wonder...

67
00:02:56,608 --> 00:02:59,608
I think she's good at running.

68
00:02:59,608 --> 00:03:01,608
I think so too.

69
00:03:01,608 --> 00:03:03,608
She's good at running.

70
00:03:03,608 --> 00:03:06,336
Yes, she's fast.

71
00:03:06,336 --> 00:03:08,336
I want to do a race.

72
00:03:08,336 --> 00:03:11,336
I'm making a race between a race and
spicy food.

73
00:03:11,336 --> 00:03:14,336
I'm going to run in the middle and eat
Nakamoto.

74
00:03:14,336 --> 00:03:17,336
Nakamoto, with all your strength.

75
00:03:17,336 --> 00:03:18,336
I want you to come.

76
00:03:18,336 --> 00:03:19,336
Let's go.

77
00:03:19,336 --> 00:03:21,336
By all means.

78
00:03:21,336 --> 00:03:23,336
I'm looking forward to it.

79
00:03:23,336 --> 00:03:27,336
Now, I'm going to pray for your success.

80
00:03:27,336 --> 00:03:31,336
I'd like to give you a cup of tea that
will cheer you up.

81
00:03:31,336 --> 00:03:32,336
Is that okay?

82
00:03:32,336 --> 00:03:33,336
Yes.

83
00:03:33,336 --> 00:03:36,336
You're an artist after all.

84
00:03:36,336 --> 00:03:38,336
A blend that will cheer up your throat.

85
00:03:38,336 --> 00:03:40,336
Herb tea bag.

86
00:03:40,336 --> 00:03:41,336
Do you usually drink tea?

87
00:03:41,336 --> 00:03:42,336
I love tea.

88
00:03:42,336 --> 00:03:43,336
Really?

89
00:03:43,336 --> 00:03:44,336
Yes.

90
00:03:44,336 --> 00:03:46,336
Then I'll do it.

91
00:03:46,336 --> 00:03:47,336
Will it make you feel better?

92
00:03:47,336 --> 00:03:48,336
Yes, it will cheer up your throat.

93
00:03:48,336 --> 00:03:50,336
I'm having a blend today.

94
00:03:50,336 --> 00:03:54,704
Thank you for your cooperation.

95
00:03:54,704 --> 00:03:56,704
It's delicious.

96
00:03:56,704 --> 00:03:57,704
I'm glad.

97
00:03:57,704 --> 00:03:59,704
I thought you were going to make a
bitter taste.

98
00:03:59,704 --> 00:04:01,704
No, no.

99
00:04:01,704 --> 00:04:04,704
I've been in Stardust for too long, so
it's getting weird.

100
00:04:04,704 --> 00:04:08,704
I was surprised. I thought it would be
delicious at first, but it's delicious
later.

101
00:04:08,704 --> 00:04:10,704
Thank you very much.

102
00:04:10,704 --> 00:04:11,704
It was good.

103
00:04:11,704 --> 00:04:13,704
Stardust was kind.

104
00:04:13,704 --> 00:04:14,704
That's right.

105
00:04:14,704 --> 00:04:16,704
Thank you very much for today.

106
00:04:16,704 --> 00:04:17,704
Thank you very much.

107
00:04:17,704 --> 00:04:18,704
It was good.

108
00:04:18,704 --> 00:04:19,704
It was fun.

109
00:04:19,704 --> 00:04:25,704
I was happy to see different sides of
you. Thank you very much.

110
00:04:25,704 --> 00:04:28,704
Finally, can I ask you one more thing?

111
00:04:28,704 --> 00:04:33,704
Could you say something cute to the
camera and close it?

112
00:04:33,704 --> 00:04:36,704
Let's go eat spicy food from the drama.

113
00:04:36,704 --> 00:04:41,744
Thank you very much.

114
00:04:41,744 --> 00:04:43,744
This program was brought to you by...

115
00:04:43,744 --> 00:04:45,744
Dark-san

116
00:04:45,744 --> 00:04:47,744
Taka-san

117
00:04:47,744 --> 00:04:49,744
Hacchan-san

118
00:04:49,744 --> 00:04:51,744
Kahikahihiko-san

119
00:04:51,744 --> 00:04:53,744
and Tatsu-san.

120
00:04:53,744 --> 00:05:07,744
Thank you very much.
