00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:13,740
Watch this video.

2
00:00:13,740 --> 00:00:15,740
Thank you for watching.

3
00:00:31,610 --> 00:00:34,850
Thank you for watching.

4
00:01:04,918 --> 00:01:10,918
Thank you for watching.

5
00:01:11,098 --> 00:01:13,098
No.

6
00:01:14,098 --> 00:01:15,098
No.

7
00:01:15,098 --> 00:01:17,098
Not a single one.

8
00:01:17,098 --> 00:01:19,098
What's going on?

9
00:01:22,098 --> 00:01:24,098
What's wrong, Doctor?

10
00:01:24,098 --> 00:01:26,098
It's terrible.

11
00:01:26,098 --> 00:01:31,098
My invention has been stolen by someone.

12
00:01:31,098 --> 00:01:34,098
What kind of invention is that?

13
00:01:34,098 --> 00:01:38,272
It's a great invention of the century.

14
00:01:38,272 --> 00:01:41,512
It's a medicine that makes you a super
idol.

15
00:01:41,512 --> 00:01:44,072
A medicine that makes you a super idol?

16
00:01:44,072 --> 00:01:45,112
Yes.

17
00:01:45,112 --> 00:01:49,432
I drank it and tried to become a super
idol.

18
00:01:49,432 --> 00:01:56,250
Who stole it?

19
00:01:56,250 --> 00:01:58,250
I'm not here!

20
00:01:59,250 --> 00:02:00,250
I'm suspicious.

21
00:02:01,250 --> 00:02:03,250
I'm the assistant of this lab.

22
00:02:04,250 --> 00:02:05,250
I'm suspicious.

23
00:02:06,250 --> 00:02:09,250
There are only you and me in this lab.

24
00:02:10,250 --> 00:02:12,250
Someone might have sneaked in.

25
00:02:13,250 --> 00:02:15,250
Of course, that's true.

26
00:02:19,250 --> 00:02:20,250
I have a good idea.

27
00:02:20,250 --> 00:02:25,250
I have a good idea. Please wait a
moment.

28
00:02:26,618 --> 00:02:28,618
Sorry to keep you waiting.

29
00:02:28,618 --> 00:02:30,618
What is that?

30
00:02:30,618 --> 00:02:32,618
This is my invention.

31
00:02:32,618 --> 00:02:33,618
Name it.

32
00:02:33,618 --> 00:02:35,618
It's a medicine that can tell if you're
the culprit.

33
00:02:35,618 --> 00:02:38,618
A medicine that can tell if you're the
culprit?

34
00:02:38,618 --> 00:02:40,618
Here, drink this.

35
00:02:40,618 --> 00:02:42,618
This?

36
00:02:42,618 --> 00:02:44,618
Drink this.

37
00:02:44,618 --> 00:02:53,626
Thank you for watching.

38
00:02:53,626 --> 00:02:55,626
Delicious!

39
00:02:55,626 --> 00:02:57,626
Oh, it's a treat!

40
00:02:57,626 --> 00:02:59,626
There's still more!

41
00:03:03,626 --> 00:03:05,626
But...

42
00:03:05,626 --> 00:03:11,626
It doesn't seem like you're the culprit.

43
00:03:11,626 --> 00:03:15,648
I told you!

44
00:03:15,648 --> 00:03:20,648
I am looking for a girl who is worthy of
this genius.

45
00:03:20,648 --> 00:03:22,648
Professor, that's me.

46
00:03:22,648 --> 00:03:25,648
Let's find the culprit together.

47
00:03:25,648 --> 00:03:28,648
Let's find it. Let's find it.

48
00:03:32,648 --> 00:03:38,648
So, it means that someone sneaked in and
stole it.

49
00:03:39,648 --> 00:03:41,648
Who is it?

50
00:03:41,648 --> 00:03:45,376
Professor, there's a letter here.

51
00:03:45,376 --> 00:03:47,376
What's that?

52
00:03:47,376 --> 00:03:49,376
Try reading it.

53
00:03:49,376 --> 00:04:02,458
What's that? Try reading it.

54
00:04:02,458 --> 00:04:05,458
I received a drug for becoming an idol.

55
00:04:05,458 --> 00:04:08,458
From the monster 2014.

56
00:04:08,458 --> 00:04:11,458
Monster 2014?

57
00:04:11,458 --> 00:04:13,458
Is that the culprit?

58
00:04:13,458 --> 00:04:16,458
Oh, there's another letter.

59
00:04:19,458 --> 00:04:22,458
It says 2.

60
00:04:22,458 --> 00:04:31,458
Look at this.

61
00:04:31,962 --> 00:04:34,962
Izuki Senpai

62
00:04:36,962 --> 00:04:39,962

Kashiwagi Hinata Senpai

70
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:15,800
What the hell!

71
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:19,800
Hey, isn't this...

72
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:23,800
...the Senpais from Shirito Ebisu Middle
School?

73
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:25,800
Who are they?

74
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:28,032
Inside this...

75
00:05:28,032 --> 00:05:31,032
Kaijin 2014.

76
00:05:35,032 --> 00:05:37,032
But how is he the culprit?

77
00:05:40,032 --> 00:05:45,032
But isn't this 2 a hint?

78
00:05:50,032 --> 00:05:51,032
2...

79
00:05:51,032 --> 00:05:57,032
What?

80
00:05:57,032 --> 00:05:59,098
2...

81
00:05:59,098 --> 00:06:01,098
2?

82
00:06:01,098 --> 00:06:03,098
From 2 to 2

83
00:06:09,098 --> 00:06:11,098
Paper?

84
00:06:13,098 --> 00:06:15,098
There's paper

85
00:06:15,098 --> 00:06:17,098
There's paper?

86
00:06:17,098 --> 00:06:19,098
There is

87
00:06:21,098 --> 00:06:23,098
Something

88
00:06:25,098 --> 00:06:27,098
Should we write something?

89
00:06:27,098 --> 00:06:29,098
Yes

90
00:06:29,632 --> 00:06:31,632
Okay

91
00:06:31,632 --> 00:06:38,632
Shiritsu Ebishuugaku 6th single will be
released on June 4th!

92
00:06:38,632 --> 00:06:40,632
Wow!

93
00:06:40,632 --> 00:06:44,632
The way you look down is...

94
00:06:44,632 --> 00:06:46,632
Okay, the title...

95
00:06:46,632 --> 00:06:48,632
The title is...

96
00:06:48,632 --> 00:06:49,632
The title is...

97
00:06:49,632 --> 00:06:50,632
The title is...

98
00:06:50,632 --> 00:06:51,632
The title is...

99
00:06:51,632 --> 00:06:52,632
The title is...

100
00:06:52,632 --> 00:06:53,632
The title is...

101
00:06:53,632 --> 00:06:54,632
The title is...

102
00:06:54,632 --> 00:06:58,906
The title is...

103
00:06:58,906 --> 00:07:01,906
Butterfly Effect!

104
00:07:07,906 --> 00:07:20,906
This single is one of the 10th
anniversary of the anime, Noita-Mina,
which is scheduled to be broadcast from
April 2014.

00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:30,720
Wow!

108
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:42,458
This is it! Don!

109
00:07:42,458 --> 00:07:44,458
This one?

110
00:07:48,458 --> 00:07:50,458
This one?

111
00:07:50,458 --> 00:07:52,458
Put this on

Osaka

117
00:08:17,912 --> 00:08:20,912
This is a lot of information

118
00:08:20,912 --> 00:08:26,912
I'm happy, but the person who stole the
medicine

119
00:08:26,912 --> 00:08:27,912
That's right

120
00:08:30,912 --> 00:08:32,912
These two

121
00:08:32,912 --> 00:08:40,128
I wonder if it's a hint

122
00:08:40,128 --> 00:08:42,128
I wonder

123
00:08:42,128 --> 00:08:44,128
It's related to 2

124
00:08:44,128 --> 00:08:46,128
2?

125
00:08:46,128 --> 00:08:54,328
But the number 2 is a

126
00:08:54,328 --> 00:08:58,328
Let's draw various 2 shapes on paper

127
00:08:58,328 --> 00:09:00,328
2 shapes?

128
00:09:00,328 --> 00:09:04,282
Let's draw a 2 shape

129
00:09:04,282 --> 00:09:06,282
What is it?

130
00:09:06,282 --> 00:09:08,282
What is it?

131
00:09:08,282 --> 00:09:10,282
What is it?

132
00:09:10,282 --> 00:09:12,282
It's like 2.

133
00:09:12,282 --> 00:09:16,282
It's like someone who eats fast.

134
00:09:16,282 --> 00:09:18,282
Who is it?

135
00:09:18,282 --> 00:09:20,282
Who is it?

136
00:09:20,282 --> 00:09:22,282
Thank you.

137
00:09:22,282 --> 00:09:24,282
2.

138
00:09:24,282 --> 00:09:26,282
2?

139
00:09:26,282 --> 00:09:28,282
This...

140
00:09:28,282 --> 00:09:30,282
This number 2...

141
00:09:30,282 --> 00:09:31,856
This number...

142
00:09:31,856 --> 00:09:33,856
How do you write?

143
00:09:33,856 --> 00:09:35,856
Number 2...

144
00:09:35,856 --> 00:09:37,856
Something is number 2?

145
00:09:37,856 --> 00:09:39,856
What is it?

146
00:09:39,856 --> 00:09:41,856
Before you write,

147
00:09:41,856 --> 00:09:43,856
let's look up a lot of things.

148
00:09:43,856 --> 00:09:45,856
Let's think about it.

149
00:09:45,856 --> 00:09:47,856
Number 2.

150
00:09:47,856 --> 00:09:49,856
Height...

151
00:09:49,856 --> 00:09:51,856
Number 2 is big.

152
00:09:51,856 --> 00:09:53,856
I...

153
00:09:53,856 --> 00:09:55,856
I'm a little...

154
00:09:55,856 --> 00:09:57,856
I'm a little...

155
00:09:57,856 --> 00:09:59,456
I'm a little...

156
00:09:59,456 --> 00:10:02,156
I'm a little...

157
00:10:02,156 --> 00:10:03,156
What?

158
00:10:04,456 --> 00:10:05,756
Number 2

159
00:10:05,756 --> 00:10:08,756
Number 2 is the person who is in the
second line.

160
00:10:08,756 --> 00:10:10,556
The person who is in the second line?

161
00:10:10,556 --> 00:10:16,156
The person who is related to the second
line.

162
00:10:16,156 --> 00:10:18,356
The person who is related to the second
line?

163
00:10:18,356 --> 00:10:24,456
I think this is a hint.

164
00:10:24,456 --> 00:10:25,956
This is...

165
00:10:25,956 --> 00:10:27,536
What is it?

166
00:10:27,536 --> 00:10:28,536
2.

167
00:10:28,536 --> 00:10:30,536
Let's draw 2.

168
00:10:30,536 --> 00:10:33,536
Should I just draw it normally?

169
00:10:33,536 --> 00:10:34,536
2.

170
00:10:34,536 --> 00:10:37,536
Let's try drawing it in various shapes.

171
00:10:37,536 --> 00:10:39,536
This is in various shapes.

172
00:10:39,536 --> 00:10:41,536
2.

173
00:10:41,536 --> 00:10:48,154
2.

174
00:10:48,154 --> 00:10:52,154
Maybe I'll get some hints.

175
00:10:52,154 --> 00:10:53,154
2.

176
00:10:53,154 --> 00:10:55,154
Can I just write it normally?

177
00:10:55,154 --> 00:10:58,154
Like kanji?

178
00:10:58,154 --> 00:11:00,154
Oh, I see.

179
00:11:00,154 --> 00:11:02,154
I'll write 2.

180
00:11:02,154 --> 00:11:04,154
Can I?

181
00:11:04,154 --> 00:11:06,154
I wonder who it is.

182
00:11:06,154 --> 00:11:08,154
Hint?

183
00:11:08,154 --> 00:11:12,154
You should think about it too.

184
00:11:12,154 --> 00:11:14,154
I got it.

185
00:11:14,154 --> 00:11:16,816
2.

186
00:11:16,816 --> 00:11:20,816
The person who was born in February.

187
00:11:20,816 --> 00:11:22,816
There might be someone.

188
00:11:23,816 --> 00:11:25,816
What is it?

189
00:11:26,816 --> 00:11:28,816
Mizuki?

190
00:11:28,816 --> 00:11:30,816
Mizuki was born in February.

191
00:11:31,816 --> 00:11:33,816
Is she the culprit?

192
00:11:33,816 --> 00:11:35,816
What is it?

193
00:11:35,816 --> 00:11:37,816
2.

194
00:11:37,816 --> 00:11:44,816
The person who was born in February.

195
00:11:44,864 --> 00:11:46,864
What else is there?

196
00:11:46,864 --> 00:11:48,864
I wonder if there's anything else.

197
00:11:48,864 --> 00:11:50,864
2

198
00:11:50,864 --> 00:11:52,864
2 and 2.

199
00:11:52,864 --> 00:11:54,864
What is 2?

200
00:11:54,864 --> 00:11:56,864
2

201
00:11:56,864 --> 00:11:58,864
I can't think of anything like 2.

202
00:11:58,864 --> 00:12:00,864
Until February.

203
00:12:00,864 --> 00:12:02,864
Until February.

204
00:12:02,864 --> 00:12:04,864
Until February 22nd.

205
00:12:04,864 --> 00:12:06,864
Until February 22nd.

206
00:12:06,864 --> 00:12:10,736
Like February 22nd.

207
00:12:10,736 --> 00:12:12,736
What else?

208
00:12:12,736 --> 00:12:15,736
How do you write 2?

209
00:12:15,736 --> 00:12:18,736
How about writing 2 in Roman numerals?

210
00:12:18,736 --> 00:12:20,736
Roman numerals?

211
00:12:20,736 --> 00:12:22,736
Do you understand, Professor?

212
00:12:22,736 --> 00:12:24,736
I'll try a new one.

213
00:12:24,736 --> 00:12:26,736
Wait, I have to think.

214
00:12:26,736 --> 00:12:28,736
I wrote 2 in Kanji.

215
00:12:28,736 --> 00:12:30,736
I didn't write in Katakana.

216
00:12:30,736 --> 00:12:32,736
2 is...

217
00:12:32,736 --> 00:12:34,736
Katakana's 2?

218
00:12:34,736 --> 00:12:36,736
Katakana's 2?

219
00:12:36,736 --> 00:12:38,736
Katakana's 2?

220
00:12:38,736 --> 00:12:40,736
I'll try.

221
00:12:40,736 --> 00:12:42,736
Katakana's 2 is this 2.

222
00:12:42,736 --> 00:12:44,736
This is Kanji's 2.

223
00:12:44,736 --> 00:12:46,736
Is that so?

224
00:12:46,736 --> 00:12:48,736
Oh, the same?

225
00:12:48,736 --> 00:12:50,736
The same!

226
00:12:50,736 --> 00:12:52,736
The same!

227
00:12:52,736 --> 00:12:54,736
I'm not good at studying.

228
00:12:54,736 --> 00:12:56,736
Wait, 2.

229
00:12:56,736 --> 00:12:58,736
2.

230
00:12:58,736 --> 00:13:00,736
I'll try in Roman numerals.

231
00:13:00,736 --> 00:13:01,312
Thank you for watching!

232
00:13:01,312 --> 00:13:04,312
Roman? I'll write it down.

233
00:13:04,312 --> 00:13:06,312
I wrote it down.

234
00:13:06,312 --> 00:13:10,312
I wrote it down like this.

235
00:13:10,312 --> 00:13:13,312
There are two 2s.

236
00:13:13,312 --> 00:13:18,312
This is Kanji, and this is Katakana.

237
00:13:18,312 --> 00:13:20,312
And then...

238
00:13:20,312 --> 00:13:24,312
Roman numerals. Let's write it down.

239
00:13:25,312 --> 00:13:27,312
Roman numerals are...

240
00:13:27,312 --> 00:13:31,312
2.

241
00:13:31,584 --> 00:13:33,584
This...

242
00:13:33,584 --> 00:13:35,584
Oh, yeah.

243
00:13:35,584 --> 00:13:37,584
Wait.

244
00:13:37,584 --> 00:13:39,584
I think I can think of something.

245
00:13:41,584 --> 00:13:43,584
Please write it down.

246
00:13:43,584 --> 00:13:45,584
This is...

247
00:13:45,584 --> 00:13:47,584
Is it like this?

248
00:13:47,584 --> 00:13:52,538
This is...

249
00:13:52,538 --> 00:13:54,538
2

250
00:13:54,538 --> 00:13:56,538
2

251
00:13:56,538 --> 00:13:58,538
2

252
00:13:58,538 --> 00:14:00,538
2

253
00:14:00,538 --> 00:14:02,538
2

254
00:14:02,538 --> 00:14:04,538
2

255
00:14:04,538 --> 00:14:06,538
2

256
00:14:06,538 --> 00:14:08,538
2

257
00:14:08,538 --> 00:14:10,538
2

258
00:14:10,538 --> 00:14:12,538
2

259
00:14:12,538 --> 00:14:14,538
2

260
00:14:14,538 --> 00:14:16,538
2

261
00:14:16,538 --> 00:14:18,538
2

262
00:14:18,538 --> 00:14:20,538
2

263
00:14:20,538 --> 00:14:22,538
2

264
00:14:22,752 --> 00:14:24,752
Let's read it normally

265
00:14:24,752 --> 00:14:26,752
It's okay to read it normally, right?

266
00:14:30,752 --> 00:14:32,752
Wait a minute

267
00:14:34,752 --> 00:14:36,752
Did everyone understand?

268
00:14:36,752 --> 00:14:40,752
Let's read it together

269
00:14:40,752 --> 00:14:42,752
1, 2

270
00:14:42,752 --> 00:14:46,752
But I don't understand that

271
00:14:46,752 --> 00:14:48,752
This is...

272
00:14:48,752 --> 00:14:50,928
I...

273
00:14:50,928 --> 00:14:55,568
Should I forget the number and just read
it normally?

274
00:14:55,568 --> 00:14:58,568
What do you think it is if you just read
it normally?

275
00:15:00,568 --> 00:15:02,568
Um... the alphabet...

276
00:15:03,568 --> 00:15:04,568
I?

277
00:15:04,568 --> 00:15:05,568
Yeah.

278
00:15:05,568 --> 00:15:07,568
So, in other words...

279
00:15:07,568 --> 00:15:10,568
So, there are two I's?

280
00:15:11,568 --> 00:15:14,568
So, I got it!

281
00:15:14,568 --> 00:15:21,120
The culprit is Ayai-san!

282
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:25,120
You've seen it well.

283
00:15:25,120 --> 00:15:27,120
Ayai-senpai!

284
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:30,120
That's right, Doctor.

285
00:15:30,120 --> 00:15:37,120
I took the medicine you invented, the
super idol medicine, from your nose.

286
00:15:37,120 --> 00:15:39,120
From my nose?

287
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:50,874
Now I'm a super idol!

288
00:15:50,874 --> 00:15:58,874
I'm going to read the color of the
southern school's home door.

289
00:15:58,874 --> 00:16:10,874
The red leaf is green, the white is
blue, the prince's hair is purple, the
prince is red, the western is orange,
the komagome is yellow, the honkoma is
green.

290
00:16:10,874 --> 00:16:14,656
Well...

291
00:16:14,656 --> 00:16:16,656
Please, take me to the doctor.

292
00:16:17,656 --> 00:16:21,656
Wow, is this the effect of the medicine?

293
00:16:22,656 --> 00:16:27,656
No, but this is different. This is a
normal Aya-senpai.

294
00:16:27,656 --> 00:16:37,656
It's painful.

295
00:16:37,656 --> 00:16:41,792
Aya-senpai?

296
00:16:41,792 --> 00:16:45,792
Kiki-sama...

297
00:16:47,792 --> 00:16:53,792
That medicine is not just a medicine.

298
00:16:53,792 --> 00:16:57,792
You got me.

299
00:16:58,792 --> 00:17:01,792
Very very very very very.

300
00:17:02,792 --> 00:17:04,792
You are...

301
00:17:05,792 --> 00:17:07,792
Ashita Mana.

302
00:17:07,792 --> 00:17:11,792
No, Ashita Mana.

303
00:17:12,560 --> 00:17:14,560
Ashita Mana!

304
00:17:16,560 --> 00:17:17,560
Ashita Mana!

305
00:17:18,560 --> 00:17:20,560
Please stop messing around, Hikari.

306
00:17:21,560 --> 00:17:22,560
Sorry.

307
00:17:23,560 --> 00:17:24,560
The medicine that makes you a super
idol.

308
00:17:25,560 --> 00:17:28,560
There is no such thing as a useful thing
in the world.

309
00:17:29,560 --> 00:17:31,560
To become a true idol,

310
00:17:31,560 --> 00:17:36,720
you just need to have the support of
your fans and hard work.

311
00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:42,720
So, we can go to China without you.

312
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:46,720
See, everyone, tomorrow is the day.

313
00:17:49,720 --> 00:17:51,720
Tomorrow is the day.

314
00:17:51,720 --> 00:17:56,416
Tomorrow is the day.

315
00:17:56,416 --> 00:18:03,416
Doctor, what is the medicine that you
stole?

316
00:18:03,416 --> 00:18:09,416
It's a simple, scary, murderous virus
that if you take that medicine, you'll
become a monster.

317
00:18:09,416 --> 00:18:21,216
What? Murderous virus?

318
00:18:21,216 --> 00:18:25,216
Why are you doing this?

319
00:18:26,216 --> 00:18:28,216
Why are you leaving me?

320
00:18:29,216 --> 00:18:31,216
It's just an interior design.

321
00:18:31,216 --> 00:18:46,234
Idiot! Why are you leaving me?

322
00:18:46,234 --> 00:18:48,234
Nyu-ba!

323
00:18:48,234 --> 00:18:50,234
Nyu-ba!

324
00:18:50,234 --> 00:18:52,234
Nyu-ba!

325
00:18:52,234 --> 00:18:54,234
Nyu-ba!

326
00:18:54,234 --> 00:19:01,210
Nyu-ba!

327
00:19:01,210 --> 00:19:18,490
Japan!

328
00:20:06,650 --> 00:20:09,650
Hello everyone!

329
00:20:09,650 --> 00:20:11,650
Hello!

330
00:20:11,650 --> 00:20:16,752
I'm Shichie Bishuuwaku, number 11,
Kobayashi Kaho.

331
00:20:16,752 --> 00:20:21,752
I'm Shichie Bishuuwaku, number 12,
Nakaayama Riko.

332
00:20:21,752 --> 00:20:29,752
So today, we're starting a different
program from last time.

333
00:20:29,752 --> 00:20:31,752
How was it?

334
00:20:31,752 --> 00:20:36,752
Today, we have a guest, Hiroto Aika-
senpai.

335
00:20:36,752 --> 00:20:42,752
Hi everyone, I'm Ebichu's mascot, number
6, Ayai-ko and Hiroto Aika.

336
00:20:42,752 --> 00:20:44,752
Nice to meet you.

337
00:20:44,752 --> 00:20:47,752
Can I ask you a question?

338
00:20:47,752 --> 00:20:52,592
Please.

339
00:20:52,592 --> 00:20:54,592
What's wrong?

340
00:20:54,592 --> 00:20:56,592
It's okay.

341
00:20:56,592 --> 00:21:00,592
This program is asking for your
questions.

342
00:21:00,592 --> 00:21:04,592
Please send your questions to social
streams.

343
00:21:04,592 --> 00:21:10,592
At the end of the program, we will
answer your questions.

344
00:21:10,592 --> 00:21:13,592
Please send your questions.

345
00:21:13,592 --> 00:21:18,362
We are waiting for your questions.

346
00:21:18,362 --> 00:21:26,362
The first part started differently,
right?

347
00:21:26,362 --> 00:21:29,362
I was surprised.

348
00:21:29,362 --> 00:21:31,362
I was nervous.

349
00:21:31,362 --> 00:21:33,362
Nuba.

350
00:21:37,362 --> 00:21:41,362
Riko-chan is always a doctor.

351
00:21:41,362 --> 00:21:43,362
She's a female doctor so she's a good
doctor.

352
00:21:43,362 --> 00:21:45,362
It was the opposite.

353
00:21:45,362 --> 00:21:47,362
That's why it was fun.

354
00:21:47,362 --> 00:21:51,362
Her hair was like a girl's dress.

355
00:21:51,362 --> 00:21:54,362
It was a little voluminous.

356
00:21:54,362 --> 00:21:56,362
It was a little tight.

357
00:21:56,362 --> 00:21:58,362
It was fun.

358
00:21:58,362 --> 00:22:00,362
It was fun.

359
00:22:00,362 --> 00:22:02,362
She was laughing.

360
00:22:02,362 --> 00:22:04,362
She was laughing.

361
00:22:04,362 --> 00:22:06,362
Aiyai's panda.

362
00:22:06,362 --> 00:22:08,362
It was cute.

363
00:22:08,362 --> 00:22:10,362
It was like a mask.

364
00:22:10,362 --> 00:22:12,362
And this.

365
00:22:12,362 --> 00:22:14,362
Aikawa's Shinkansen.

366
00:22:14,362 --> 00:22:17,362
It was cute.

367
00:22:17,362 --> 00:22:19,362
It was number 6.

368
00:22:19,362 --> 00:22:21,362
It was cute.

369
00:22:21,362 --> 00:22:23,362
It was amazing.

370
00:22:23,362 --> 00:22:25,362
The two were cute.

371
00:22:25,362 --> 00:22:27,362
It was nice.

372
00:22:27,362 --> 00:22:29,362
It was the same flower.

373
00:22:29,362 --> 00:22:31,362
It was all flowers.

374
00:22:31,362 --> 00:22:33,362
It was cute.

375
00:22:33,362 --> 00:22:35,362
It was cute.

376
00:22:35,362 --> 00:22:39,362
It was like a monster and a monster.

377
00:22:39,362 --> 00:22:42,362
It was like a villain.

378
00:22:42,362 --> 00:22:46,362
The way she laughed was fun.

379
00:22:46,362 --> 00:22:48,362
She was laughing.

380
00:22:48,362 --> 00:22:50,362
It was fun.

381
00:22:50,362 --> 00:22:52,362
Everyone was like that.

382
00:22:52,362 --> 00:22:54,362
It was cool.

383
00:22:54,362 --> 00:22:56,362
It was cool.

384
00:22:56,362 --> 00:22:58,362
It was like a mountain.

385
00:22:58,362 --> 00:23:00,362
It was like a mountain.

386
00:23:00,362 --> 00:23:02,362
It was amazing.

387
00:23:02,362 --> 00:23:05,362
I like the home door.

388
00:23:05,362 --> 00:23:07,362
The home door?

389
00:23:07,362 --> 00:23:09,362
The one with the green.

390
00:23:09,362 --> 00:23:11,362
The color.

391
00:23:11,362 --> 00:23:14,362
There was a different type of metal.

392
00:23:14,362 --> 00:23:16,362
I want to see it today.

393
00:23:16,362 --> 00:23:18,362
Amazing.

394
00:23:18,362 --> 00:23:20,362
I understood it well.

395
00:23:20,362 --> 00:23:22,362
Did you look into it?

396
00:23:22,362 --> 00:23:24,362
Yes, I did.

397
00:23:24,362 --> 00:23:26,362
Amazing.

398
00:23:26,362 --> 00:23:28,362
Aiyaiya.

399
00:23:28,362 --> 00:23:30,362
Amazing.

400
00:23:33,362 --> 00:23:35,362
Is this tea?

401
00:23:35,362 --> 00:23:37,362
This is amazing.

402
00:23:37,362 --> 00:23:39,362
It smells good.

403
00:23:39,362 --> 00:23:41,362
It's in.

404
00:23:41,362 --> 00:23:43,362
Tea?

405
00:23:43,362 --> 00:23:45,362
It's a little red.

406
00:23:45,362 --> 00:23:47,362
Amazing.

407
00:23:47,362 --> 00:23:49,362
Is it sweet?

408
00:23:49,362 --> 00:23:51,362
It's amazing.

409
00:23:51,362 --> 00:23:53,362
It's three times sweeter.

410
00:23:53,362 --> 00:23:55,362
Amazing.

411
00:23:55,362 --> 00:23:57,362
I'm surprised.

412
00:23:57,362 --> 00:23:59,362
It's beautiful.

413
00:23:59,362 --> 00:24:01,362
Do you want to try it?

414
00:24:01,362 --> 00:24:03,362
It's warm.

415
00:24:03,362 --> 00:24:05,362
It's warm.

416
00:24:05,362 --> 00:24:07,362
It's warm.

417
00:24:07,362 --> 00:24:09,362
It's good.

418
00:24:09,362 --> 00:24:11,362
It's good.

419
00:24:11,362 --> 00:24:13,362
It's good.

420
00:24:13,362 --> 00:24:15,362
It's good.

421
00:24:15,362 --> 00:24:17,362
It's good.

422
00:24:17,362 --> 00:24:19,362
It's good.

423
00:24:19,362 --> 00:24:21,362
It's good.

424
00:24:21,362 --> 00:24:23,362
It's tea.

425
00:24:23,362 --> 00:24:25,362
I want to eat this.

426
00:24:25,362 --> 00:24:27,362
Eat it.

427
00:24:27,362 --> 00:24:29,362
Eat it.

428
00:24:29,362 --> 00:24:31,362
I want to eat it.

429
00:24:31,362 --> 00:24:33,362
It smells good.

430
00:24:33,362 --> 00:24:35,362
It's a cookie.

431
00:24:35,362 --> 00:24:37,362
It's a cookie.

432
00:24:37,362 --> 00:24:39,362
We can eat to whatever we want.

433
00:24:39,362 --> 00:24:41,362
Let's eat together.

434
00:24:41,362 --> 00:24:43,362
Let's eat it all together.

435
00:24:43,362 --> 00:24:45,362
Thank you.

436
00:24:45,362 --> 00:24:47,362
Thank you.

437
00:24:47,362 --> 00:24:49,362
Thank you.

438
00:24:49,362 --> 00:24:51,362
We all eat together.

439
00:24:51,362 --> 00:24:53,362
We all eat together.

440
00:24:53,362 --> 00:24:55,362
We all eat together.

441
00:24:55,362 --> 00:24:57,362
Bye bye!

442
00:24:57,552 --> 00:24:59,552
It's good.

443
00:24:59,552 --> 00:25:01,552
It's good.

444
00:25:01,552 --> 00:25:03,552
It goes well with tea.

445
00:25:03,552 --> 00:25:05,552
You just said a good thing.

446
00:25:05,552 --> 00:25:07,552
It goes well with tea.

447
00:25:07,552 --> 00:25:11,552
There's a question in the place where
Yuka is eating.

448
00:25:11,552 --> 00:25:14,552
What is it?

449
00:25:14,552 --> 00:25:16,552
Question.

450
00:25:16,552 --> 00:25:18,552
Ta-da.

451
00:25:18,552 --> 00:25:22,552
Is there a place you want to go on a
tour?

452
00:25:22,552 --> 00:25:24,552
Just the two of us.

453
00:25:24,552 --> 00:25:28,552
But...

454
00:25:28,552 --> 00:25:30,552
Where is it?

455
00:25:30,552 --> 00:25:34,552
We want to go anywhere.

456
00:25:34,552 --> 00:25:36,552
We want to go anywhere.

457
00:25:36,552 --> 00:25:38,552
We want to go anywhere.

458
00:25:38,552 --> 00:25:42,552
We've been saying this for a long time.

459
00:25:42,552 --> 00:25:42,832
Please subscribe to our channel.

460
00:25:42,832 --> 00:25:44,832
We want to go to the cherry blossom
garden.

461
00:25:44,832 --> 00:25:46,832
We love cherry blossoms.

462
00:25:46,832 --> 00:25:48,832
Let's go to Yamagata.

463
00:25:48,832 --> 00:25:50,832
Yamagata.

464
00:25:50,832 --> 00:25:52,832
That's the second one.

465
00:25:52,832 --> 00:25:54,832
Boa wants to go to Oita.

466
00:25:54,832 --> 00:25:56,832
We want to go to Kyushu.

467
00:25:56,832 --> 00:25:58,832
We want to go to Oita.

468
00:25:58,832 --> 00:26:00,832
Oise?

469
00:26:00,832 --> 00:26:02,832
We want to go to Kyushu.

470
00:26:02,832 --> 00:26:04,832
We want to go.

471
00:26:04,832 --> 00:26:06,832
We want to go by plane.

472
00:26:06,832 --> 00:26:08,832
We want to go by plane.

473
00:26:08,832 --> 00:26:10,832
We want to cry.

474
00:26:10,832 --> 00:26:12,832
We can get consomme soup.

475
00:26:12,832 --> 00:26:14,832
I like it.

476
00:26:14,832 --> 00:26:16,832
It's delicious.

477
00:26:16,832 --> 00:26:18,832
When you're flying,

478
00:26:18,832 --> 00:26:20,832
you drink tea.

479
00:26:22,832 --> 00:26:24,832
It swells.

480
00:26:24,832 --> 00:26:26,832
When you bring candy,

481
00:26:26,832 --> 00:26:28,832
it swells.

482
00:26:28,832 --> 00:26:30,832
Let's try it.

483
00:26:30,832 --> 00:26:32,832
Let's do it.

484
00:26:32,832 --> 00:26:34,832
It's fun.

485
00:26:34,832 --> 00:26:36,832
There was a tour announcement.

486
00:26:36,832 --> 00:26:38,832
So we can go.

487
00:26:38,832 --> 00:26:40,832
Maybe.

488
00:26:40,832 --> 00:26:42,832
We can start in Osaka.

489
00:26:42,832 --> 00:26:44,832
We can go to Osaka twice.

490
00:26:44,832 --> 00:26:46,832
We can go to Osaka.

491
00:26:46,832 --> 00:26:48,832
I like Osaka.

492
00:26:48,832 --> 00:26:50,832
It's fun.

493
00:26:50,832 --> 00:26:52,832
I've never been there.

494
00:26:52,832 --> 00:26:54,832
Okonomiyaki.

495
00:26:54,832 --> 00:26:56,832
Negi-yaki.

496
00:26:56,832 --> 00:26:58,832
Takoyaki.

497
00:26:58,832 --> 00:27:00,832
It's delicious.

498
00:27:00,832 --> 00:27:02,832
The ice-dough is delicious.

499
00:27:02,832 --> 00:27:04,832
The hot fried bread

500
00:27:04,832 --> 00:27:06,832
has soft cream.

501
00:27:06,832 --> 00:27:08,832
It looks delicious.

502
00:27:10,048 --> 00:27:12,048
I want to eat it.

503
00:27:12,048 --> 00:27:14,048
I want to eat it.

504
00:27:14,048 --> 00:27:16,048
I'm curious about the TARZ.

505
00:27:16,048 --> 00:27:18,048
I'm curious.

506
00:27:18,048 --> 00:27:20,048
I'm excited.

507
00:27:20,048 --> 00:27:22,048
I'm excited.

508
00:27:22,048 --> 00:27:24,048
There's a new song.

509
00:27:24,048 --> 00:27:26,048
The costumes.

510
00:27:26,048 --> 00:27:28,048
I'm looking forward to seeing the songs.

511
00:27:28,048 --> 00:27:30,048
I'm looking forward to seeing the songs.

512
00:27:30,048 --> 00:27:32,048
The first new song.

513
00:27:32,048 --> 00:27:34,048
The first new song.

514
00:27:34,048 --> 00:27:35,984
The first single.

515
00:27:35,984 --> 00:27:38,984
We're the first ones to participate.

516
00:27:38,984 --> 00:27:40,984
I'm excited.

517
00:27:40,984 --> 00:27:42,984
I'm excited.

518
00:27:42,984 --> 00:27:46,984
The voice and the chorus part.

519
00:27:46,984 --> 00:27:50,984
I wonder if the two of us are different.

520
00:27:50,984 --> 00:27:53,984
That's what I'm looking forward to.

521
00:27:53,984 --> 00:27:54,984
I'm curious.

522
00:27:54,984 --> 00:27:57,984
I think everyone is looking forward to
it.

523
00:27:57,984 --> 00:28:02,896
Next song.

524
00:28:02,896 --> 00:28:05,896
NU'VER.

525
00:28:10,896 --> 00:28:13,896
I'm into dancing lately.

526
00:28:13,896 --> 00:28:16,896
Is there a song you recommend?

527
00:28:20,896 --> 00:28:22,896
Dance?

528
00:28:22,896 --> 00:28:23,896
Dance?

529
00:28:23,896 --> 00:28:25,896
I'm into dancing lately.

530
00:28:26,896 --> 00:28:27,896
What is it?

531
00:28:27,896 --> 00:28:28,192
NU'VER.

532
00:28:28,192 --> 00:28:31,192
But it's just a song you recommend.

533
00:28:31,192 --> 00:28:34,192
Yeah, like a song you like in the album.

534
00:28:34,192 --> 00:28:37,192
I like the song, but I like the
choreography.

535
00:28:37,192 --> 00:28:40,000
I heard it's hard to dance.

536
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:48,000
I haven't danced yet. I'm a little bit
slow. I'm so fast at memorizing the
dance.

537
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:54,000
I was crying when I couldn't remember a
song.

538
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:58,000
I can't remember it at all.

539
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:03,744
It's hard. I can't remember the dance.

540
00:29:03,744 --> 00:29:05,744
You say that a lot.

541
00:29:05,744 --> 00:29:07,744
I say it a lot.

542
00:29:07,744 --> 00:29:09,744
I say it a lot.

543
00:29:09,744 --> 00:29:13,744
What other song do you recommend?

544
00:29:13,744 --> 00:29:15,744
What song do you recommend?

545
00:29:15,744 --> 00:29:19,744
But you dance, right?

546
00:29:19,744 --> 00:29:23,744
I think a song that's easy to dance to
is good.

547
00:29:23,744 --> 00:29:25,744
There's a song that's just right.

548
00:29:25,744 --> 00:29:27,744
What is it?

549
00:29:27,744 --> 00:29:29,744
I'm nervous.

550
00:29:29,744 --> 00:29:33,120
I think I can dance to it.

551
00:29:33,120 --> 00:29:35,120
How was it?

552
00:29:35,120 --> 00:29:37,120
I wonder what it was.

553
00:29:37,120 --> 00:29:40,120
It was easy for everyone to dance.

554
00:29:40,120 --> 00:29:42,120
It was cool.

555
00:29:42,120 --> 00:29:48,120
It was difficult, but we did our best.

556
00:29:48,120 --> 00:29:50,120
It was fun.

557
00:29:50,120 --> 00:29:55,008
It was fun to dance with everyone.

558
00:29:55,008 --> 00:29:59,008
And also, run more.

559
00:29:59,008 --> 00:30:02,008
That was hard.

560
00:30:02,008 --> 00:30:04,008
That was fun.

561
00:30:04,008 --> 00:30:06,008
Run more.

562
00:30:09,008 --> 00:30:11,008
When we all remember it.

563
00:30:13,008 --> 00:30:16,008
You put your hand on the ceiling.

564
00:30:18,008 --> 00:30:22,008
We're doing it with a lot of energy.

565
00:30:22,008 --> 00:30:26,008
It was fun when we were dancing to run
more.

566
00:30:26,008 --> 00:30:28,008
It was fun.

567
00:30:28,008 --> 00:30:29,232
Run more.

568
00:30:29,232 --> 00:30:31,232
How do you feel about it?

569
00:30:31,232 --> 00:30:39,232
Well, I don't think we can change the
topic here.

570
00:30:39,232 --> 00:30:41,232
We can't change it?

571
00:30:41,232 --> 00:30:49,232
Finally, Sunday is the first week we've
been waiting for.

572
00:30:49,232 --> 00:30:51,232
That's right.

573
00:30:51,232 --> 00:30:56,224
How do you feel about Sunday?

574
00:30:56,224 --> 00:31:02,224
This week, I'm going to be with Mizuki
and Mayama.

575
00:31:02,224 --> 00:31:05,224
Both of them have their own unique
personalities.

576
00:31:05,224 --> 00:31:09,224
But this time, I'm going to be with Aya
and Mirei.

577
00:31:09,224 --> 00:31:11,224
They're completely different.

578
00:31:11,224 --> 00:31:14,224
I'm really looking forward to it.

579
00:31:14,224 --> 00:31:23,088
What would you like to do if you were to
be a producer?

580
00:31:23,088 --> 00:31:26,088
There are a lot of things I want to do.

581
00:31:26,088 --> 00:31:33,088
But one of them is a live performance
with only cool songs.

582
00:31:33,088 --> 00:31:40,088
I think it's fun to do it with a man in
a live performance that's not a shrimp.

583
00:31:40,088 --> 00:31:41,888
And...

584
00:31:41,888 --> 00:31:45,328
Po-chan said she likes to do it with a
man in a live performance.

585
00:31:45,328 --> 00:31:51,728
I like takoyaki, and I think it's fun to
do it with a man in a live performance.

586
00:31:51,728 --> 00:31:54,008
But I don't know if it's okay.

587
00:31:54,008 --> 00:31:58,568
I think it's fun to do it with a man in
a live performance.

588
00:31:58,568 --> 00:32:01,040
Next, the Falafel Hold King.

589
00:32:01,040 --> 00:32:10,040
We all draw pictures and present them
during the live performance.

590
00:32:10,040 --> 00:32:11,040
It's fun!

591
00:32:11,040 --> 00:32:15,040
It's so much fun that I can't decide.

592
00:32:15,040 --> 00:32:20,040
But I don't know what will happen if
it's too much.

593
00:32:20,040 --> 00:32:24,040
I think I'll be very worried if I'm left
to it.

594
00:32:24,040 --> 00:32:26,040
It's fun!

595
00:32:26,040 --> 00:32:29,040
The Falafel is fun!

596
00:32:29,040 --> 00:32:31,640
What will you do if you become a

597
00:32:31,640 --> 00:32:32,880
Falafel Hold King?

598
00:32:32,880 --> 00:32:40,880
I want to run on the stage like a sports
event.

599
00:32:40,880 --> 00:32:43,880
It would be fun if you really do it.

600
00:32:43,880 --> 00:32:50,880
If you have an image so far, I hope you
have fun.

601
00:32:50,880 --> 00:32:52,880
That's also important.

602
00:32:52,880 --> 00:32:53,344
Thank you for your viewing.

603
00:32:53,344 --> 00:32:56,344
But you like cucumbers, right?

604
00:32:56,344 --> 00:33:01,344
So we all made a cucumber morning drink
party.

605
00:33:01,344 --> 00:33:03,344
Cucumber festival.

606
00:33:03,344 --> 00:33:04,344
Cucumber festival.

607
00:33:04,344 --> 00:33:05,344
Litter Produce.

608
00:33:05,344 --> 00:33:07,344
That's a good idea.

609
00:33:07,344 --> 00:33:09,344
The costume is green.

610
00:33:09,344 --> 00:33:10,344
Cucumber.

611
00:33:11,344 --> 00:33:13,344
Everyone is green.

612
00:33:13,344 --> 00:33:15,344
It's fun.

613
00:33:15,344 --> 00:33:17,344
It's fun, isn't it?

614
00:33:17,344 --> 00:33:23,344
I don't know what it's going to be like
for the family.

615
00:33:23,344 --> 00:33:25,344
I'm sure you'll have fun.

616
00:33:25,344 --> 00:33:27,936
I'm looking forward to it.

617
00:33:27,936 --> 00:33:39,936
質問? 何だっけ? アイエイがエビチューに入って、一番楽しかったこととか。

618
00:33:39,936 --> 00:33:45,936
えー!一番楽しかったことなんだろ! でもいつも楽しいんだけど、

619
00:33:45,936 --> 00:33:53,936
でもエビチューってさ、いろんな曲がある。 だから知らなかった。

620
00:33:53,936 --> 00:34:03,936
自分ってこういう声も出るんだなって思う。
こういう風にできるんだなっていうのがいっぱい知れたのが楽しいかなって思う。

621
00:34:03,936 --> 00:34:11,936
でも二人ももっとね、いろんな自分を知れるんじゃないかな。 そうか! そうだね。

622
00:34:11,936 --> 00:34:18,048
今からやって、めっちゃリッターがクールな感じになるかもしれないしね。
なんたらどうすんの? イメージが!

623
00:34:18,048 --> 00:34:26,048
私がクールになったらどうしよう。 今ちょっと髪の毛クールだった。

624
00:34:26,048 --> 00:34:34,048
楽しいよね。 楽しそう。

625
00:34:34,048 --> 00:34:41,072
自主で今回一部からマヤマヤがプロデュースしてくれるじゃん。

626
00:34:41,072 --> 00:34:44,372
Let's listen to her voice on the phone.

627
00:34:44,372 --> 00:34:45,372
I want to hear it.

628
00:34:45,372 --> 00:34:46,372
Let's hear it.

629
00:34:46,372 --> 00:34:47,372
I'll take it.

630
00:34:47,372 --> 00:34:48,372
Okay.

631
00:34:49,372 --> 00:34:50,372
Wow, she's coming.

632
00:34:50,372 --> 00:34:51,372
Wow.

633
00:34:51,372 --> 00:34:52,372
Hello?

634
00:34:52,372 --> 00:34:53,372
Hello?

635
00:34:53,372 --> 00:34:54,372
Hello?

636
00:34:54,372 --> 00:34:55,872
ets Brian Sorry

637
00:34:55,872 --> 00:35:00,872
ets Brian

638
00:35:00,872 --> 00:35:03,872
Hello?

639
00:35:03,872 --> 00:35:05,872
Hello?

640
00:35:05,872 --> 00:35:08,872
Good work, good work!

641
00:35:08,872 --> 00:35:10,872
Is this connected?

642
00:35:10,872 --> 00:35:14,872
Hello? This is Hirota

643
00:35:14,872 --> 00:35:16,872
Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha

644
00:35:17,120 --> 00:35:19,120
Hello?

645
00:35:19,120 --> 00:35:23,120
We were talking about the school
festival

646
00:35:23,120 --> 00:35:25,120
Yeah, we were

647
00:35:25,120 --> 00:35:27,120
You were watching?

648
00:35:27,120 --> 00:35:29,120
Yeah, we were playing games

649
00:35:29,120 --> 00:35:31,120
You're so funny

650
00:35:33,120 --> 00:35:35,120
You know, you're going to do a part of
the show

651
00:35:35,120 --> 00:35:37,120
Yeah, I'm going to do it

652
00:35:37,120 --> 00:35:41,120
It was a corner to listen to your
enthusiasm

653
00:35:41,120 --> 00:35:43,120
Yeah

654
00:35:43,120 --> 00:35:45,120
Yeah, yeah?

655
00:35:45,120 --> 00:35:47,008
Are you going to do it?

656
00:35:47,008 --> 00:35:49,008
I'll do my best.

657
00:35:49,008 --> 00:35:51,008
Just that?

658
00:35:51,008 --> 00:35:53,008
Because...

659
00:35:53,008 --> 00:35:55,008
It's like a joke?

660
00:35:55,008 --> 00:35:57,008
It's going to be like that.

661
00:35:57,008 --> 00:35:59,008
There's no...

662
00:35:59,008 --> 00:36:01,008
Family...

663
00:36:01,008 --> 00:36:03,008
I'm glad I heard it.

664
00:36:03,008 --> 00:36:05,008
I'm going to make a joke.

665
00:36:05,008 --> 00:36:07,008
I'm not going to do it.

666
00:36:07,008 --> 00:36:09,008
I'm not going to do it.

667
00:36:09,008 --> 00:36:11,008
I don't have a cosplay, but...

668
00:36:11,008 --> 00:36:13,008
I'm going to do it.

669
00:36:13,008 --> 00:36:14,416
It's a little different again.

670
00:36:14,416 --> 00:36:18,016
It's like Mayama.

671
00:36:18,016 --> 00:36:26,296
I hope you enjoy the Ebichu world in
Mayama.

672
00:36:26,296 --> 00:36:27,776
It's a big deal.

673
00:36:27,776 --> 00:36:29,776
Then, both of you.

674
00:36:29,776 --> 00:36:31,576
Mayama.

675
00:36:31,576 --> 00:36:35,776
Let's talk.

676
00:36:35,776 --> 00:36:37,776
Hello.

677
00:36:37,776 --> 00:36:38,776
Good evening.

678
00:36:38,776 --> 00:36:40,624
Mayama.

679
00:36:40,624 --> 00:36:42,624
You can talk to me now.

680
00:36:42,624 --> 00:36:44,624
Hello?

681
00:36:44,624 --> 00:36:46,624
Hello?

682
00:36:46,624 --> 00:36:48,624
Kaho?

683
00:36:48,624 --> 00:36:50,624
I'm talking to you now.

684
00:36:50,624 --> 00:36:52,624
I'm talking to you now.

685
00:36:52,624 --> 00:36:54,624
I'm talking to you now.

686
00:36:54,624 --> 00:36:56,624
I'm nervous to call you.

687
00:36:56,624 --> 00:36:58,624
I'm nervous.

688
00:36:58,624 --> 00:37:00,624
Mayama,

689
00:37:00,624 --> 00:37:02,624
Mayama,

690
00:37:02,624 --> 00:37:02,816
Mayama,

691
00:37:02,816 --> 00:37:06,816
I can hear your voice!

692
00:37:06,816 --> 00:37:09,816
It's because you're on the phone.

693
00:37:11,816 --> 00:37:14,816
What's the question, Mayama?

694
00:37:15,816 --> 00:37:17,816
I was watching you.

695
00:37:17,816 --> 00:37:23,816
How were the three of you at Nuva?

696
00:37:23,816 --> 00:37:26,560
Nuva, right? It's Nuva!

697
00:37:26,560 --> 00:37:29,980
I was going to go out with Nuva when I
got a call, but I couldn't get out.

698
00:37:29,980 --> 00:37:33,500
I'm laughing at the phone.

699
00:37:33,500 --> 00:37:36,300
Nuva!

700
00:37:36,300 --> 00:37:38,560
It's popular.

701
00:37:38,560 --> 00:37:39,840
I wonder if it's popular.

702
00:37:39,840 --> 00:37:41,400
Hello?

703
00:37:41,400 --> 00:37:42,480
Hello?

704
00:37:42,480 --> 00:37:43,940
Can you hear me?

705
00:37:43,940 --> 00:37:46,360
Can you hear me?

706
00:37:46,360 --> 00:37:47,980
Can you hear me?

707
00:37:47,980 --> 00:37:49,300
Hello?

708
00:37:49,300 --> 00:37:51,700
I have to get closer.

709
00:37:51,700 --> 00:37:52,960
Yeah.

710
00:37:52,960 --> 00:37:54,320
Riko?

711
00:37:54,320 --> 00:37:56,032
Yes, it's어요.

712
00:37:56,032 --> 00:37:58,032
Riko? Yes, it's Riko.

713
00:37:58,032 --> 00:38:00,032
It's a cucumber.

714
00:38:00,032 --> 00:38:02,032
No, it's not!

715
00:38:02,032 --> 00:38:04,032
No!

716
00:38:06,032 --> 00:38:08,032
It's the current Kaho-chan.

717
00:38:08,032 --> 00:38:10,032
The current Kaho?

718
00:38:10,032 --> 00:38:12,032
I'm the senior.

719
00:38:12,032 --> 00:38:14,032
Which is which?

720
00:38:14,032 --> 00:38:16,032
I don't know.

721
00:38:16,032 --> 00:38:19,040
I wonder if it's this scary.

722
00:38:19,040 --> 00:38:22,040
It's Aiyai.

723
00:38:22,040 --> 00:38:25,040
It's not Aiyai.

724
00:38:25,040 --> 00:38:27,040
It's Aiyai.

725
00:38:27,040 --> 00:38:30,040
It's Aikari Hirota.

726
00:38:30,040 --> 00:38:34,040
It's Riko Nakayama.

727
00:38:34,040 --> 00:38:36,040
It's Aikari Hirota.

728
00:38:36,040 --> 00:38:37,040
It's Aikari Hirota.

729
00:38:37,040 --> 00:38:40,040
There's a grandma on the phone.

730
00:38:40,040 --> 00:38:43,632
What's going on?

731
00:38:43,632 --> 00:38:45,632
What's this?

732
00:38:45,632 --> 00:38:47,632
It's funny.

733
00:38:47,632 --> 00:38:50,672
I don't know.

734
00:38:50,672 --> 00:38:52,672
I'm Hinota Aika.

735
00:38:55,672 --> 00:38:57,672
There was a girl who looked like Hashida
Mara.

736
00:38:58,672 --> 00:39:00,672
I made a mistake.

737
00:39:02,672 --> 00:39:04,672
What's your name?

738
00:39:09,672 --> 00:39:11,672
I'm Hinota Aika.

739
00:39:12,672 --> 00:39:14,672
I'm Hinota Aika.

740
00:39:15,672 --> 00:39:17,672
I'm Hinota Aika.

741
00:39:17,672 --> 00:39:19,672
I'm Hinota Aika.

742
00:39:20,672 --> 00:39:22,672
I'm Riko Nakayama.

743
00:39:23,672 --> 00:39:25,672
I'm Kobayashi Kamo.

744
00:39:26,672 --> 00:39:28,672
I'm Kobayashi Kamo.

745
00:39:29,672 --> 00:39:31,672
It's time to say goodbye.

746
00:39:31,672 --> 00:39:36,304
Goodbye.

747
00:39:36,304 --> 00:39:38,864
Cut it. Thank you.

748
00:39:38,864 --> 00:39:40,864
Please look forward to it.

749
00:39:40,864 --> 00:39:41,704
Yes.

750
00:39:41,704 --> 00:39:43,064
Thank you. Good luck.

751
00:39:43,064 --> 00:39:45,064
Thank you. Bye bye, Mayama.

752
00:39:45,064 --> 00:39:46,264
Bye bye bye.

753
00:39:46,264 --> 00:39:47,064
Bye bye.

754
00:39:47,064 --> 00:39:49,064
Bye bye.

755
00:39:49,064 --> 00:39:51,064
Mayama, thank you.

756
00:39:51,064 --> 00:39:53,064
Thank you.

757
00:39:53,064 --> 00:39:55,904
Bye bye.

758
00:39:55,904 --> 00:39:58,904
The phone is so funny.

759
00:39:59,904 --> 00:40:02,904
I get nervous when I'm on the phone.

760
00:40:02,904 --> 00:40:05,904
Really? I can't see your face.

761
00:40:05,904 --> 00:40:07,904
What if you're angry?

762
00:40:07,904 --> 00:40:09,904
I get nervous.

763
00:40:09,904 --> 00:40:12,904
While we were coming here,

764
00:40:12,904 --> 00:40:14,904
we got a job.

765
00:40:14,904 --> 00:40:15,904
A job?

766
00:40:15,904 --> 00:40:17,904
Yes, a job.

767
00:40:17,904 --> 00:40:20,496
I was like, bring it to me.

768
00:40:20,496 --> 00:40:24,496
I think it's for the two of us.

769
00:40:24,496 --> 00:40:26,496
What is it?

770
00:40:26,496 --> 00:40:28,496
It's written here.

771
00:40:30,496 --> 00:40:34,496
It's a job for Kahoriko.

772
00:40:34,496 --> 00:40:36,496
What is it?

773
00:40:36,496 --> 00:40:44,496
Kahoriko will be doing a special report
on Sunday.

774
00:40:44,496 --> 00:40:46,496
Wow, a report.

775
00:40:46,496 --> 00:40:50,496
What's your feeling right now?

776
00:40:50,496 --> 00:40:54,496
What's your feeling right now?

777
00:40:54,496 --> 00:40:58,496
It's for us.

778
00:40:58,496 --> 00:41:00,496
It's a report.

779
00:41:00,496 --> 00:41:04,496
There wasn't a report.

780
00:41:04,496 --> 00:41:08,496
I'm glad that the two of you came on
Sunday.

781
00:41:08,496 --> 00:41:10,496
I'm glad you came.

782
00:41:10,496 --> 00:41:18,496
This report will be broadcasted on the
next episode of Sora's Kahoriko.

783
00:41:18,496 --> 00:41:20,496
That's great.

784
00:41:20,496 --> 00:41:24,496
So go to Sora on Sunday and report.

785
00:41:24,496 --> 00:41:27,744
Next time on Kahoriko...

786
00:41:27,744 --> 00:41:29,464
...is going to be a long one.

787
00:41:29,464 --> 00:41:30,504
What are we going to do?

788
00:41:30,504 --> 00:41:31,504
I'm excited!

789
00:41:31,504 --> 00:41:33,704
We have to be reporters.

790
00:41:33,704 --> 00:41:35,824
It's a bit difficult, but...

791
00:41:35,824 --> 00:41:37,304
We'll do our best!

792
00:41:37,304 --> 00:41:39,144
We'll do our best!

793
00:41:39,144 --> 00:41:40,624
We'll do our best!

794
00:41:40,624 --> 00:41:43,024
I'm excited!

795
00:41:43,024 --> 00:41:44,024
I'm excited!

796
00:41:44,024 --> 00:41:45,024
I'm excited!

797
00:41:45,384 --> 00:41:46,384
Amazing!

798
00:41:48,384 --> 00:41:49,704
We'll be reporters.

799
00:41:49,704 --> 00:41:52,048
How are you feeling right now?

800
00:41:52,048 --> 00:41:54,048
I'm practicing.

801
00:41:54,048 --> 00:41:56,048
I'm practicing for the report.

802
00:41:56,048 --> 00:41:58,048
I'm going to practice.

803
00:41:58,048 --> 00:42:00,048
Okay.

804
00:42:00,048 --> 00:42:02,048
Today, how was it?

805
00:42:02,048 --> 00:42:04,048
Today, it was fun.

806
00:42:04,048 --> 00:42:06,048
Today,

807
00:42:06,048 --> 00:42:09,408
Please tell us how you felt today.

808
00:42:09,408 --> 00:42:12,908
Today, I watched the first video of
Kaoriko.

809
00:42:12,908 --> 00:42:16,908
The second video was a little rough
because of the bad tempo.

810
00:42:16,908 --> 00:42:21,908
I watched Kaoriko's hard work.

811
00:42:21,908 --> 00:42:24,408
I'm very happy to be able to appear.

812
00:42:24,408 --> 00:42:28,908
I'm looking forward to the next video.

813
00:42:28,908 --> 00:42:31,908
I'll check the world.

814
00:42:31,908 --> 00:42:33,908
Thank you very much.

815
00:42:33,908 --> 00:42:34,908
You watched it.

816
00:42:34,908 --> 00:42:36,408
That's right.

817
00:42:36,408 --> 00:42:37,908
That's great.

818
00:42:37,908 --> 00:42:39,280
That's great.

819
00:42:39,280 --> 00:42:42,280
It was fun. I'm looking forward to it.

820
00:42:42,280 --> 00:42:46,280
Do your best. I'm looking forward to it.

821
00:42:46,280 --> 00:42:53,280
I'll do my best. I don't know if there's
a Gari-ben or not, but I hope there is.

822
00:42:53,280 --> 00:42:56,280
I'm getting excited.

823
00:42:58,280 --> 00:43:01,280
I'll say goodbye here.

824
00:43:02,280 --> 00:43:06,096
Then it's about time. That's right.

825
00:43:06,096 --> 00:43:09,096
It's the end of the corner.

826
00:43:09,096 --> 00:43:12,096
The time is...

827
00:43:12,096 --> 00:43:17,096
The time for the end of the experiment
has come.

828
00:43:17,096 --> 00:43:22,096
Thank you, Hiroto Aikawa Senpai.

829
00:43:22,096 --> 00:43:24,096
Thank you.

830
00:43:24,096 --> 00:43:27,096
Keep up the good work.

831
00:43:27,096 --> 00:43:28,096
I will.

832
00:43:28,096 --> 00:43:30,096
Bye bye.

833
00:43:30,096 --> 00:43:32,096
Thank you, everyone.

834
00:43:32,096 --> 00:43:34,096
Bye bye.

835
00:43:34,096 --> 00:43:36,096
Bye bye.

836
00:43:36,400 --> 00:43:39,400
Wow, I'm surprised.

837
00:43:39,400 --> 00:43:41,400
Should we bring this microphone?

838
00:43:41,400 --> 00:43:43,400
This one?

839
00:43:43,400 --> 00:43:46,400
Let's use this microphone.

840
00:43:46,400 --> 00:43:48,400
How do you feel now?

841
00:43:48,400 --> 00:43:50,400
Please bring it.

842
00:43:50,400 --> 00:43:52,400
I only said this.

843
00:43:52,400 --> 00:43:56,400
Let's think about it a little more.

844
00:43:56,400 --> 00:43:59,400
Let's go a little more like a reporter.

845
00:43:59,400 --> 00:44:01,400
Then bring the camera.

846
00:44:01,400 --> 00:44:03,400
How do you feel?

847
00:44:03,400 --> 00:44:05,168
I'm surprised.

848
00:44:05,168 --> 00:44:07,168
I'm looking forward to it.

849
00:44:07,168 --> 00:44:09,168
How was it today?

850
00:44:09,168 --> 00:44:11,168
Today...

851
00:44:11,168 --> 00:44:15,168
It was a little different from usual.

852
00:44:15,168 --> 00:44:19,168
It was a different appearance from
usual.

853
00:44:19,168 --> 00:44:22,168
I was a little nervous.

854
00:44:22,168 --> 00:44:23,168
I was nervous.

855
00:44:23,168 --> 00:44:25,168
Acting.

856
00:44:25,168 --> 00:44:27,168
Acting.

857
00:44:27,168 --> 00:44:29,168
Acting was a little...

858
00:44:29,168 --> 00:44:34,128
I was wondering if it was okay.

859
00:44:34,128 --> 00:44:36,128
It was okay.

860
00:44:36,128 --> 00:44:37,128
It was fun.

861
00:44:37,128 --> 00:44:40,128
It was fun to change the mood.

862
00:44:40,128 --> 00:44:46,128
I want to do it better.

863
00:44:46,128 --> 00:44:49,128
Then, do another one.

864
00:44:49,128 --> 00:44:51,128
Next time...

865
00:44:51,128 --> 00:44:53,128
Sorry.

866
00:44:53,128 --> 00:44:55,808
Okay, then...

867
00:44:55,808 --> 00:45:01,808
Thank you for watching the program until
the end.

868
00:45:01,808 --> 00:45:06,148
We are Shirito Ebisu High School, No.11
Kobayashi Kahori and

869
00:45:06,148 --> 00:45:10,648
Shirito Ebisu High School, No.12 Riko
Nakayama.

870
00:45:10,648 --> 00:45:11,808
We are

871
00:45:11,808 --> 00:45:14,528
Sol, Hiro, and Kahori.

872
00:45:14,528 --> 00:45:23,066
Bye bye.

873
00:45:23,066 --> 00:45:25,066
Bye bye!

874
00:45:25,066 --> 00:45:30,066
Next time, we'll be looking forward to
the next episode!

875
00:45:30,066 --> 00:45:34,406
See you next time!
