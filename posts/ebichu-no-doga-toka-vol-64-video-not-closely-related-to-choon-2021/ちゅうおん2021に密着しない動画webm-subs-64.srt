00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,000
Ebichu's video!

3
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:13,000
Today is the 14th!

4
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:17,000
We're going to the rehearsal now!

5
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,000
It didn't rain.

6
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:28,000
We're going to the rehearsal now!

7
00:00:39,770 --> 00:00:45,770
Thank you for your continued support.

8
00:00:45,770 --> 00:00:47,770
It's raining.

9
00:00:47,770 --> 00:00:49,770
It's raining.

10
00:00:49,770 --> 00:00:51,770
It's raining.

11
00:00:51,770 --> 00:00:53,770
It's raining.

12
00:00:53,770 --> 00:00:55,770
It's raining.

13
00:00:55,770 --> 00:00:57,770
It's raining.

14
00:00:57,770 --> 00:00:59,770
It's raining.

15
00:00:59,770 --> 00:01:01,770
It's raining.

16
00:01:01,770 --> 00:01:03,770
Hello.

17
00:01:05,770 --> 00:01:07,770
I ran outside.

18
00:01:07,770 --> 00:01:09,770
I ran outside.

19
00:01:09,770 --> 00:01:11,770
I slipped.

20
00:01:11,770 --> 00:01:13,770
I slipped.

21
00:01:13,770 --> 00:01:15,770
I slipped.

22
00:01:15,770 --> 00:01:17,770
I'm Mariko Nakayama.

23
00:01:17,770 --> 00:01:19,770
I'm Yuno Koguro.

24
00:01:19,770 --> 00:01:21,770
I'm Kana Korimaya.

25
00:01:21,770 --> 00:01:23,770
I'm Kana Korimaya.

26
00:01:23,770 --> 00:01:25,770
I'm Kana Korimaya.

27
00:01:25,770 --> 00:01:27,770
I'm Noibuko.

28
00:01:27,770 --> 00:01:29,770
I'm Noibuko.

29
00:01:29,770 --> 00:01:31,770
I'm Kana Korimaya.

30
00:01:31,770 --> 00:01:33,770
I'm Kana Korimaya.

31
00:01:33,770 --> 00:01:35,770
It's over.

32
00:01:35,770 --> 00:01:37,770
I'm very nervous today.

33
00:01:41,770 --> 00:01:43,770
I was nervous before rehearsal.

34
00:01:43,770 --> 00:01:45,770
I'm more nervous after rehearsal.

35
00:01:45,770 --> 00:01:47,770
I'm not talking.

36
00:01:47,770 --> 00:01:49,770
I'm nervous.

37
00:01:51,770 --> 00:01:53,770
I'm nervous and my voice is weak.

38
00:01:53,770 --> 00:01:55,770
I'll practice.

39
00:01:55,770 --> 00:01:57,770
I'll practice.

40
00:01:57,770 --> 00:01:59,770
I'll practice.

41
00:01:59,770 --> 00:02:01,770
I have a voice problem.

42
00:02:01,770 --> 00:02:03,770
I have to be careful.

43
00:02:03,770 --> 00:02:05,770
I have to be careful.

44
00:02:07,770 --> 00:02:09,770
I'll do my best.

45
00:02:17,770 --> 00:02:19,770
It's raining.

46
00:02:19,770 --> 00:02:21,770
I made a turtle pose.

47
00:02:21,770 --> 00:02:23,770
I made a turtle pose.

48
00:02:23,770 --> 00:02:25,770
I made a turtle pose.

49
00:02:25,770 --> 00:02:27,770
I made a turtle pose.

50
00:02:27,770 --> 00:02:29,770
I'm sorry.

51
00:02:32,770 --> 00:02:37,770
I'm under pressure to talk every time I
pass by here.

52
00:02:38,770 --> 00:02:42,770
I'm always wearing a cover of CHU-YO.

53
00:02:42,770 --> 00:02:47,770
I'm going to sing the song of Mika
Nakashima.

54
00:02:49,770 --> 00:02:52,770
I had a co-host.

55
00:02:52,770 --> 00:03:00,770
I'm going to cover the song of Mika
Nakashima.

56
00:03:00,770 --> 00:03:06,770
I think I'll be a good accent.

57
00:03:06,770 --> 00:03:10,530
I'll do my best.

58
00:03:10,530 --> 00:03:12,530
It's really expensive.

59
00:03:12,530 --> 00:03:19,530
It's expensive, but I'll do my best with
my voice.

60
00:03:20,530 --> 00:03:22,530
I'll do my best.

61
00:03:22,530 --> 00:03:24,530
I love it.

62
00:03:27,530 --> 00:03:29,530
I love it.

63
00:03:29,530 --> 00:03:31,530
How is it?

64
00:03:31,530 --> 00:03:42,530
I'm so hungry.

65
00:03:42,530 --> 00:03:44,530
I'm full.

66
00:03:44,530 --> 00:03:46,530
Did you eat?

67
00:03:46,530 --> 00:03:51,530
I ate and did a 30-minute exercise.

68
00:03:51,530 --> 00:03:53,530
Did you eat?

69
00:03:53,530 --> 00:03:55,530
I ate.

70
00:03:55,530 --> 00:04:05,530
I'm nervous to sing alone.

71
00:04:05,530 --> 00:04:13,530
Everyone sings first.

72
00:04:13,530 --> 00:04:17,530
It was fun.

73
00:04:17,530 --> 00:04:20,530
It's raining and it's cold.

74
00:04:20,530 --> 00:04:27,530
I'm glad I came.

75
00:04:27,530 --> 00:04:36,530
I'm practicing outside.

76
00:04:36,530 --> 00:04:42,530
I came to the lesson and sang.

77
00:04:42,530 --> 00:04:52,530
I was surprised to see a guard from
afar.

78
00:04:52,530 --> 00:04:58,530
I was surprised to see a guard from
afar.

79
00:04:58,530 --> 00:05:04,530
I was surprised to see a guard from
afar.

80
00:05:04,530 --> 00:05:14,530
I was surprised to see a guard from
afar.

81
00:05:14,530 --> 00:05:20,530
There is a guard pass.

82
00:05:20,530 --> 00:05:23,530
I didn't lower my guard.

83
00:05:23,530 --> 00:05:28,530
I didn't lower my guard.

84
00:05:28,530 --> 00:05:33,530
I was surprised to see a guard from
afar.

85
00:05:33,530 --> 00:05:35,530
Why did I take a picture?

86
00:05:35,530 --> 00:05:38,530
This is my stand.

87
00:05:38,530 --> 00:05:44,530
I was surprised to see a guard from
afar.

88
00:05:44,530 --> 00:05:49,794
I was surprised to see a guard from
afar.

89
00:05:49,794 --> 00:05:51,794
I said, I'm a rabbit.

90
00:05:51,794 --> 00:05:53,794
I said, I understand.

91
00:05:53,794 --> 00:05:56,794
The staff around me said,

92
00:05:56,794 --> 00:05:58,794
I like the little rabbits.

93
00:05:58,794 --> 00:06:00,794
I said, I'm a little rabbit.

94
00:06:00,794 --> 00:06:02,794
I'll crush it.

95
00:06:02,794 --> 00:06:04,794
My stand suddenly appeared.

96
00:06:04,794 --> 00:06:06,794
I'm a rabbit.

97
00:06:07,794 --> 00:06:09,794
So I'm a rabbit.

98
00:06:09,794 --> 00:06:11,794
I'm a rabbit.

99
00:06:13,794 --> 00:06:15,794
It seems to have arrived.

100
00:06:15,794 --> 00:06:17,794
Po-chan's...

101
00:06:17,794 --> 00:06:19,794
What was it?

102
00:06:19,794 --> 00:06:21,794
It's a rabbit from TETTLE BOYS.

103
00:06:21,794 --> 00:06:23,794
Thank you.

104
00:06:23,794 --> 00:06:25,794
I changed my clothes.

105
00:06:28,794 --> 00:06:30,794
Look.

106
00:06:37,794 --> 00:06:39,794
Why are you so excited?

107
00:06:39,794 --> 00:06:41,794
Because I ate a shine muscat.

108
00:06:43,794 --> 00:06:45,794
I got a lot of food.

109
00:06:45,794 --> 00:06:47,794
I'll eat a lot.

110
00:06:51,794 --> 00:06:53,794
I'm practicing on the road.

111
00:06:53,794 --> 00:06:55,794
I'm a little sad.

112
00:06:55,794 --> 00:06:57,794
The first day of the first part.

113
00:06:57,794 --> 00:06:59,794
The first day...

114
00:06:59,794 --> 00:07:00,794
What?

115
00:07:00,794 --> 00:07:02,794
It's the first day.

116
00:07:02,794 --> 00:07:04,794
Thank you for your hard work.

117
00:07:04,794 --> 00:07:06,794
The circuit talk was smooth.

118
00:07:06,794 --> 00:07:08,794
Bye-bye.

119
00:07:11,794 --> 00:07:13,794
It's over.

120
00:07:13,794 --> 00:07:15,794
The circuit is over.

121
00:07:15,794 --> 00:07:17,794
It was fun.

122
00:07:17,794 --> 00:07:19,794
Was it fun?

123
00:07:19,794 --> 00:07:21,794
It was fun.

124
00:07:21,794 --> 00:07:23,794
I was nervous.

125
00:07:25,794 --> 00:07:27,794
I'm not in the picture.

126
00:07:27,794 --> 00:07:29,794
I'm going to the picture.

127
00:07:29,794 --> 00:07:31,794
No, no, no.

128
00:07:31,794 --> 00:07:33,794
I can't stop you.

129
00:07:33,794 --> 00:07:35,794
I'm a little nervous.

130
00:07:35,794 --> 00:07:37,794
It was hard to understand.

131
00:07:37,794 --> 00:07:43,794
I was nervous.

132
00:07:43,794 --> 00:07:45,794
No, no, no.

133
00:07:45,794 --> 00:07:47,794
I'm going to the picture.

134
00:07:49,794 --> 00:07:51,794
Is it over?

135
00:07:51,794 --> 00:07:53,794
It's over.

136
00:07:53,794 --> 00:07:55,794
The first part is over.

137
00:07:55,794 --> 00:07:57,794
The second part is over.

138
00:07:57,794 --> 00:07:59,794
I'm going to the end.

139
00:07:59,794 --> 00:08:01,794
It looks fun.

140
00:08:01,794 --> 00:08:03,794
It was fun this year.

141
00:08:03,794 --> 00:08:09,794
The person who came didn't show it.

142
00:08:09,794 --> 00:08:13,794
I wanted to show it, but I was sad.

143
00:08:13,794 --> 00:08:15,794
I'm going to the second part.

144
00:08:17,794 --> 00:08:19,794
I'm a little nervous.

145
00:08:19,794 --> 00:08:21,794
I'm a little nervous.

146
00:08:21,794 --> 00:08:23,794
I have a promise.

147
00:08:23,794 --> 00:08:25,794
You'll remember it.

148
00:08:25,794 --> 00:08:27,426
The second part.

149
00:08:27,426 --> 00:08:30,426
Day 1, Day 2.

150
00:08:30,426 --> 00:08:33,426
I'll do my best for the next
performance.

151
00:08:33,426 --> 00:08:38,426
I'll do my best to sing the song.

152
00:08:38,426 --> 00:08:44,426
I sang Tomoya Harada's Dandenaiyan.

153
00:08:46,426 --> 00:08:48,426
I'll do my best.

154
00:08:51,426 --> 00:08:53,426
Go-de again.

155
00:08:53,426 --> 00:08:55,426
Go-de, please.

156
00:08:55,426 --> 00:08:57,426
Suddenly?

157
00:08:57,426 --> 00:08:59,426
Suddenly?

158
00:08:59,426 --> 00:09:01,426
You came to do this?

159
00:09:22,426 --> 00:09:24,426
Let's enjoy the performance.

160
00:09:24,426 --> 00:09:25,426
Where are we?

161
00:09:25,426 --> 00:09:26,426
Chuo!

162
00:09:26,426 --> 00:09:27,426
We are ITZY!

163
00:09:27,426 --> 00:09:29,426
Let's go to Japan!

164
00:09:37,426 --> 00:09:39,426
Thank you for your hard work.

165
00:09:39,426 --> 00:09:41,426
It's over.

166
00:09:47,426 --> 00:09:49,426
It was over.

167
00:09:49,426 --> 00:09:51,426
Day 1 is over.

168
00:09:51,426 --> 00:09:58,426
The rain stopped at the end of the day.

169
00:09:58,426 --> 00:10:01,426
I enjoyed it.

170
00:10:01,426 --> 00:10:06,426
I'm glad I could see your faces.

171
00:10:06,426 --> 00:10:08,426
It's over.

172
00:10:08,426 --> 00:10:10,426
It's over.

173
00:10:14,426 --> 00:10:15,426
It's over.

174
00:10:15,426 --> 00:10:17,426
Good night.

175
00:10:17,426 --> 00:10:19,426
Day 2.

176
00:10:21,426 --> 00:10:23,426
Good morning.

177
00:10:25,426 --> 00:10:31,426
I ate pho in Saitama prefecture this
morning.

178
00:10:31,426 --> 00:10:33,426
It was very delicious.

179
00:10:33,426 --> 00:10:35,426
But this is not Yamanashi prefecture.

180
00:10:35,426 --> 00:10:44,426
I'm full.

181
00:10:44,426 --> 00:10:47,426
Let's have a good day.

182
00:10:47,426 --> 00:10:49,426
Day 3.

183
00:10:49,426 --> 00:10:51,426
It was over.

184
00:10:51,426 --> 00:10:53,426
It was over.

185
00:10:53,426 --> 00:10:55,426
Good morning.

186
00:10:55,426 --> 00:10:57,426
It was over.

187
00:10:57,426 --> 00:10:59,426
It was over.

188
00:10:59,426 --> 00:10:59,874
Thank you for your hard work.

189
00:10:59,874 --> 00:11:04,474
It's cold today but I'll do my best!

190
00:11:04,474 --> 00:11:06,474
Please wait for me!

191
00:11:15,874 --> 00:11:19,874
I'm going to sing a song.

192
00:11:19,874 --> 00:11:21,874
I'm going to sing a song.

193
00:11:28,874 --> 00:11:30,874
Are you filming?

194
00:11:30,874 --> 00:11:32,874
I'm filming.

195
00:11:32,874 --> 00:11:34,874
Which one should I do?

196
00:11:34,874 --> 00:11:36,874
I'm filming.

197
00:11:38,874 --> 00:11:40,874
Which one should I do?

198
00:11:42,874 --> 00:11:44,874
What?

199
00:11:44,874 --> 00:11:47,874
What?

200
00:11:47,874 --> 00:11:51,874
Everyone, please stand up.

201
00:11:59,874 --> 00:12:01,874
What kind of ending is this?

202
00:12:04,874 --> 00:12:06,874
Thank you very much.

203
00:12:08,874 --> 00:12:10,874
What kind of ending is this?

204
00:12:10,874 --> 00:12:13,874
It's the main show.

205
00:12:13,874 --> 00:12:15,874
It's the main show.

206
00:12:22,874 --> 00:12:24,874
I finished my performance.

207
00:12:24,874 --> 00:12:26,874
I finished my performance.

208
00:12:26,874 --> 00:12:28,874
It's the end of the year.

209
00:12:28,874 --> 00:12:30,874
It's the end of the year.

210
00:12:30,874 --> 00:12:32,874
It's the end of the year.

211
00:12:32,874 --> 00:12:36,874
I'll do my best for the next university
entrance exam.

212
00:12:36,874 --> 00:12:38,874
Bye bye.

213
00:12:38,874 --> 00:12:40,874
I said Fami-en.

214
00:12:40,874 --> 00:12:43,874
I said Fami-en at the end of the
performance.

215
00:12:43,874 --> 00:12:45,874
I said Fami-en in the middle.

216
00:12:45,874 --> 00:12:49,874
Chuu-on Fami-en.

217
00:12:49,874 --> 00:12:52,874
Let's say it's safe.

218
00:12:52,874 --> 00:12:54,874
It's too beautiful.

219
00:12:54,874 --> 00:12:56,874
I want to do it.

220
00:12:56,874 --> 00:12:58,874
Thank you.

221
00:12:58,874 --> 00:13:00,874
I'm glad you're not going to get hurt.

222
00:13:00,874 --> 00:13:02,874
I'm glad you're not going to get hurt.

223
00:13:02,874 --> 00:13:04,874
I'm glad you're not going to get hurt.

224
00:13:04,874 --> 00:13:06,874
I'm glad you're not going to get hurt.

225
00:13:06,874 --> 00:13:08,874
I'm glad you're not going to get hurt.

226
00:13:08,874 --> 00:13:10,874
I'm glad you're not going to get hurt.

227
00:13:10,874 --> 00:13:12,874
I'm glad you're not going to get hurt.

228
00:13:12,874 --> 00:13:14,874
I'm glad you're not going to get hurt.

229
00:13:14,874 --> 00:13:16,874
I'm glad you're not going to get hurt.

230
00:13:20,874 --> 00:13:23,874
My favorite song is the last song.

231
00:13:23,874 --> 00:13:25,874
The last earphone song was really fun.

232
00:13:25,874 --> 00:13:29,874
Please listen to it when you get into a
fight with a CD.

233
00:13:29,874 --> 00:13:31,874
Yellow light

234
00:13:31,874 --> 00:13:33,874
It's a lot different from the usual
tempo.

235
00:13:33,874 --> 00:13:38,874
It's a relaxing atmosphere with a nice
atmosphere.

236
00:13:38,874 --> 00:13:42,874
I think that's the beauty of this place.

237
00:13:42,874 --> 00:13:49,798
Please watch it.

238
00:13:49,798 --> 00:13:51,798
The show is over.

239
00:13:51,798 --> 00:13:53,798
Was it fun?

240
00:13:53,798 --> 00:13:55,798
I had a lot of fun.

241
00:13:55,798 --> 00:14:02,798
I hope you all feel free to enjoy the
show.

242
00:14:02,798 --> 00:14:07,798
Please look forward to next year.

243
00:14:07,798 --> 00:14:09,798
Bye!

244
00:14:11,798 --> 00:14:13,798
I'm a ghost.

245
00:14:13,798 --> 00:14:18,798
I was really worried about Kapila.

246
00:14:18,798 --> 00:14:22,798
But she clapped in front of me.

247
00:14:22,798 --> 00:14:24,798
I was so happy.

248
00:14:24,798 --> 00:14:26,798
Thank you.

249
00:14:26,798 --> 00:14:33,798
I hope the atmosphere of the team and
the sound of the music will be healed.

250
00:14:33,798 --> 00:14:35,798
Thank you.

251
00:14:35,798 --> 00:14:40,798
I was trying not to blink, but I was
surprised.

252
00:14:40,798 --> 00:14:42,798
Thank you.

253
00:14:42,798 --> 00:14:44,798
What are you thinking?

254
00:14:44,798 --> 00:14:46,798
What are you doing?

255
00:14:46,798 --> 00:14:51,798
Thank you for two days.

256
00:14:51,798 --> 00:14:56,798
I was happy to be able to cheer for you.

257
00:14:56,798 --> 00:14:58,798
I'm going to take a break.

258
00:14:58,798 --> 00:15:02,798
I'm looking forward to seeing you again.

259
00:15:02,798 --> 00:15:04,798
Let's meet with a smile.

260
00:15:04,798 --> 00:15:06,798
Thank you.

261
00:15:06,798 --> 00:15:08,798
I'm getting more people.

262
00:15:08,798 --> 00:15:10,798
I'm getting more people.

263
00:15:10,798 --> 00:15:12,798
Thank you.

264
00:15:12,798 --> 00:15:14,798
Thank you.

265
00:15:14,798 --> 00:15:16,798
I was happy.
