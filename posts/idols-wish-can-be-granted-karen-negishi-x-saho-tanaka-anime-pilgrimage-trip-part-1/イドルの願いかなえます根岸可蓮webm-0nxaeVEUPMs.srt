1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
I'm Negishikare.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:08,000
Today, my wish came true.

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:14,656
I will visit the anime sites in Tokyo.

4
00:00:15,656 --> 00:00:17,656
Thank you, everyone.

5
00:00:17,656 --> 00:00:20,656
There are places I've always wanted to
visit.

6
00:00:20,656 --> 00:00:28,656
Today, I will visit the top 3 places
I've always wanted to visit.

7
00:00:28,656 --> 00:00:32,656
I'm now in Arakawa.

8
00:00:32,656 --> 00:00:35,656
I will explain what kind of anime it is
later.

9
00:00:35,656 --> 00:00:37,656
It's a pilgrimage.

10
00:00:37,656 --> 00:00:39,656
It's hard to do it alone.

11
00:00:39,656 --> 00:00:40,656
I want to take a picture.

12
00:00:40,656 --> 00:00:45,656
It's hard to do it alone.

13
00:00:45,656 --> 00:00:48,656
I have invited another person.

14
00:00:48,656 --> 00:00:51,656
She is Saho Tanaka.

15
00:00:51,656 --> 00:00:54,656
She also likes anime.

16
00:00:54,656 --> 00:00:55,656
She came here today.

17
00:00:55,656 --> 00:00:57,656
Thank you.

18
00:00:57,656 --> 00:01:01,656
It's a pilgrimage to the place where
anime is based.

19
00:01:01,656 --> 00:01:03,656
It's very fun.

20
00:01:03,656 --> 00:01:06,656
It's like the scenery I saw in anime.

21
00:01:06,656 --> 00:01:08,656
I will go alone and with my mother.

22
00:01:08,656 --> 00:01:10,656
With your mother?

23
00:01:10,656 --> 00:01:11,656
Are you watching it with your mother?

24
00:01:11,656 --> 00:01:12,656
No.

25
00:01:12,656 --> 00:01:15,656
I will take a picture.

26
00:01:15,656 --> 00:01:17,656
You are friends with your mother.

27
00:01:17,656 --> 00:01:18,656
Yes.

28
00:01:18,656 --> 00:01:19,656
Thank you.

29
00:01:19,656 --> 00:01:21,656
Let's go.

30
00:01:21,656 --> 00:01:22,656
Let's go.

31
00:01:22,656 --> 00:01:25,656
What kind of anime do you like?

32
00:01:25,656 --> 00:01:29,656
I like interesting anime.

33
00:01:29,656 --> 00:01:32,656
I like comedy.

34
00:01:32,656 --> 00:01:33,656
I like Zombie Land.

35
00:01:33,656 --> 00:01:35,656
I miss that anime.

36
00:01:35,656 --> 00:01:36,656
I like Megami Tensei.

37
00:01:36,656 --> 00:01:38,656
I like the weird one.

38
00:01:38,656 --> 00:01:40,656
I like the weird one.

39
00:01:40,656 --> 00:01:42,656
I like the one with the worst story.

40
00:01:42,656 --> 00:01:44,656
I am impressed by it.

41
00:01:44,656 --> 00:01:45,656
I know.

42
00:01:45,656 --> 00:01:47,656
I know it well.

43
00:01:47,656 --> 00:01:50,656
What kind of anime do you watch?

44
00:01:50,656 --> 00:01:54,656
I watch anime.

45
00:01:54,656 --> 00:01:57,656
You are very popular.

46
00:01:57,656 --> 00:02:02,656
I chose three points today.

47
00:02:02,656 --> 00:02:04,656
They are all love comics.

48
00:02:04,656 --> 00:02:06,656
I like Jiro Kome.

49
00:02:06,656 --> 00:02:10,112
I see.

50
00:02:11,112 --> 00:02:16,112
What do you do in the pilgrimage?

51
00:02:16,112 --> 00:02:21,112
I go to the places where the anime was
based.

52
00:02:21,112 --> 00:02:27,112
I can't go to the places in the other
world.

53
00:02:27,112 --> 00:02:35,112
For example, in the school, there is a
place where the anime was based.

54
00:02:35,112 --> 00:02:41,112
I go there and take pictures in the
school.

55
00:02:41,112 --> 00:02:45,112
I feel like I can enter the school.

56
00:02:45,112 --> 00:02:52,112
I can see the world.

57
00:02:52,112 --> 00:02:56,112
You can see the places you wanted to go.

58
00:02:56,112 --> 00:02:58,112
I can see the places I wanted to go.

59
00:02:58,112 --> 00:03:02,112
I can't see the places I wanted to go.

60
00:03:02,112 --> 00:03:06,112
I'm happy.

61
00:03:09,690 --> 00:03:14,690
The 3rd place we wanted to go to is...

62
00:03:14,690 --> 00:03:19,690
Koito Senkyo and Chocolate's Junrei
Seichi!

63
00:03:19,690 --> 00:03:20,690
Yay!

64
00:03:20,690 --> 00:03:23,690
It's called Aragawa Rock Gate.

65
00:03:23,690 --> 00:03:27,690
It's a place that appears in Koichako
several times.

66
00:03:27,690 --> 00:03:29,690
It also appears in the beginning.

67
00:03:29,690 --> 00:03:31,690
It appears suddenly.

68
00:03:31,690 --> 00:03:34,690
It also appears in the second half.

69
00:03:34,690 --> 00:03:36,690
It's a place that's a key point.

70
00:03:36,690 --> 00:03:37,690
I see.

71
00:03:37,690 --> 00:03:40,690
I'm glad to hear that. It's a rock gate.

72
00:03:40,690 --> 00:03:42,690
It's a real one.

73
00:03:42,690 --> 00:03:43,690
Wow.

74
00:03:43,690 --> 00:03:44,690
It's amazing.

75
00:03:44,690 --> 00:03:47,690
I wanted to take a picture of this.

76
00:03:47,690 --> 00:03:50,690
What kind of picture will you take here?

77
00:03:50,690 --> 00:03:52,690
I'm not sure.

78
00:03:52,690 --> 00:03:54,690
I want to take a picture of various
places.

79
00:03:54,690 --> 00:03:55,690
That's good.

80
00:03:55,690 --> 00:03:59,690
The 4th place we wanted to go to is...

81
00:03:59,690 --> 00:04:01,274
Koito Senkyo and Chocolate's Junrei
Seichi!

82
00:04:01,274 --> 00:04:03,274
How do I take a picture?

83
00:04:03,274 --> 00:04:05,274
How?

84
00:04:05,274 --> 00:04:07,274
Like this?

85
00:04:07,274 --> 00:04:09,274
What should I use?

86
00:04:09,274 --> 00:04:11,274
Your phone.

87
00:04:11,274 --> 00:04:13,274
How?

88
00:04:18,816 --> 00:04:20,816
I thought you were a bicycle.

89
00:04:21,816 --> 00:04:23,816
I'm so happy.

90
00:04:24,816 --> 00:04:28,816
Can I take a picture of you riding on
the bike?

91
00:04:28,816 --> 00:04:30,816
I'll take a picture from here.

92
00:04:31,816 --> 00:04:32,816
I'll take a picture.

93
00:04:32,816 --> 00:04:34,816
Cheese!

94
00:04:34,816 --> 00:04:40,816
I'm so happy.

95
00:04:42,696 --> 00:04:43,696
Thank you so much!

96
00:04:44,696 --> 00:04:46,696
How do you feel about being the 3rd?

97
00:04:47,696 --> 00:04:51,696
I've never thought I could come here.

98
00:04:52,696 --> 00:04:55,696
I'm so happy to be here.

99
00:04:56,696 --> 00:05:04,696
I'm so happy that I feel like I'm in
this world.

100
00:05:05,696 --> 00:05:06,696
Thank you so much.

101
00:05:07,696 --> 00:05:08,696
Let's move on to the 2nd place.

102
00:05:08,696 --> 00:05:09,696
Let's go to the 2nd place.

103
00:05:10,696 --> 00:05:11,696
Let's jump and move.

104
00:05:12,696 --> 00:05:13,696
Ready, set, go!

105
00:05:14,696 --> 00:05:19,696
We came to the 2nd place.

106
00:05:20,696 --> 00:05:22,696
I think we jumped well.

107
00:05:23,696 --> 00:05:24,696
We did the opposite.

108
00:05:25,696 --> 00:05:26,696
We changed our fashion.

109
00:05:27,696 --> 00:05:28,696
We changed our fashion.

110
00:05:29,696 --> 00:05:30,696
We changed our fashion.

111
00:05:30,696 --> 00:05:32,218
We changed our fashion.

112
00:05:32,218 --> 00:05:34,218
Where is this place?

113
00:05:34,218 --> 00:05:36,218
What is this place?

114
00:05:36,218 --> 00:05:42,218
This is the site of the work, How to
raise a wild boar.

115
00:05:42,218 --> 00:05:45,218
I'm already looking at it in front of
me.

116
00:05:45,218 --> 00:05:49,218
It's called Saekano because of the way
to raise a wild boar.

117
00:05:49,218 --> 00:05:53,218
This is the main place of Saekano.

118
00:05:53,218 --> 00:05:55,218
I see.

119
00:05:55,218 --> 00:06:03,218
This is also the place where Saekano's
great name was born.

120
00:06:03,218 --> 00:06:06,218
This is the place where they met.

121
00:06:06,218 --> 00:06:08,218
I'm already standing on it.

122
00:06:08,218 --> 00:06:10,218
You are already climbing.

123
00:06:10,218 --> 00:06:14,218
This is the holy ground of Saekano,
Saka.

124
00:06:16,218 --> 00:06:17,218
What do you want to do here?

125
00:06:17,218 --> 00:06:19,218
I want to take a lot of pictures.

126
00:06:19,218 --> 00:06:21,248
I want to take a lot of pictures.

127
00:06:22,248 --> 00:06:30,248
The story of the heroine of the Saekana
is that Kato-chan is standing on the top
of the hill.

128
00:06:31,248 --> 00:06:35,248
The story of the Saekana is that Kato-
chan wants to make a game.

129
00:06:35,248 --> 00:06:44,248
The story of the Saekana is that Kato-
chan wants to make a game.

130
00:06:45,608 --> 00:06:48,608
I want to make it more gorgeous in the
anime.

131
00:06:49,608 --> 00:06:51,608
But it's too plain.

132
00:06:52,608 --> 00:06:54,608
The color is amazing.

133
00:06:55,608 --> 00:06:56,608
Thank you.

134
00:06:57,608 --> 00:06:58,608
This is a broken one.

135
00:06:59,608 --> 00:07:00,608
Are you going to climb this now?

136
00:07:01,608 --> 00:07:02,608
Yes, I am.

137
00:07:03,608 --> 00:07:05,608
Let's climb to take a picture.

138
00:07:06,608 --> 00:07:09,608
The story of the Saekana is that Kato-
chan wants to make a game.

139
00:07:09,608 --> 00:07:10,202
I want to make it more gorgeous in the
anime.

140
00:07:10,202 --> 00:07:12,202
Wow, amazing.

141
00:07:12,202 --> 00:07:14,202
It's so nice.

142
00:07:16,202 --> 00:07:18,202
She must be a fan of you.

143
00:07:18,202 --> 00:07:20,202
She must be a fan of you.

144
00:07:20,202 --> 00:07:22,202
I don't know.

145
00:07:24,202 --> 00:07:26,202
It's a little hard.

146
00:07:26,202 --> 00:07:40,202
It's a little hard.

147
00:07:40,922 --> 00:07:42,922
I'm fine.

148
00:07:42,922 --> 00:07:44,922
Good.

149
00:07:44,922 --> 00:07:46,922
I'll leave it to you.

150
00:07:46,922 --> 00:07:48,922
I'll run to the other side.

151
00:07:48,922 --> 00:07:50,922
See you.

152
00:07:52,922 --> 00:07:54,922
I'll take a picture.

153
00:07:54,922 --> 00:07:56,922
Cheese.

154
00:07:56,922 --> 00:07:58,922
Cheese.

155
00:07:58,922 --> 00:08:00,922
See you.

156
00:08:03,802 --> 00:08:05,802
Where is the best place?

157
00:08:05,802 --> 00:08:09,802
There is a scene where the hat falls
down.

158
00:08:09,802 --> 00:08:14,802
The animation may not be so long.

159
00:08:14,802 --> 00:08:19,802
I think it's a good place to say that
the hat falls down around here.

160
00:08:19,802 --> 00:08:21,802
I see.

161
00:08:21,802 --> 00:08:29,802
It's a meeting place, so I'm glad I took
a picture.

162
00:08:29,802 --> 00:08:32,802
I want to bring the same hat.

163
00:08:32,802 --> 00:08:36,802
I want to take a picture with the hat.

164
00:08:36,802 --> 00:08:38,802
It's a good place.

165
00:08:38,802 --> 00:08:43,802
The top of the mountain is where Kato-
chan stands.

166
00:08:45,802 --> 00:08:48,802
We have arrived at the top of the
mountain.

167
00:08:48,802 --> 00:08:50,802
It's a little hard.

168
00:08:50,802 --> 00:08:52,802
It's a steep slope.

169
00:08:52,802 --> 00:08:55,802
It's 22% of the slope.

170
00:08:55,802 --> 00:08:57,802
It's amazing.

171
00:08:57,802 --> 00:09:03,802
I can't understand it only here.

172
00:09:03,962 --> 00:09:05,962
It's good, isn't it?

173
00:09:15,322 --> 00:09:19,322
I'm going to take a lot of pictures
because there are no people.

174
00:09:20,322 --> 00:09:24,322
I took a good picture because it was
beautiful when I took a picture like
this.

175
00:09:24,322 --> 00:09:26,322
I'll take a picture with an air drone.

176
00:09:33,322 --> 00:09:35,322
Thank you very much.

177
00:09:35,322 --> 00:09:38,322
I'm happy to be able to take a picture
from the top.

178
00:09:38,322 --> 00:09:39,872
I took a picture.

179
00:09:40,872 --> 00:09:41,872
It's the best!

180
00:09:50,872 --> 00:09:51,872
Are you satisfied with the second place?

181
00:09:52,872 --> 00:09:53,872
I'm very satisfied!

182
00:09:54,872 --> 00:09:55,872
I'm so happy that I passed the second
place.

183
