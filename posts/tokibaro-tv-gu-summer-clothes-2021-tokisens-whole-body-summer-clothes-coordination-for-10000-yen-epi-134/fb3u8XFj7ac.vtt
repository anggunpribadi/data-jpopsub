 Good evening!

 Today, we came to Jiyu!

00:12.728 --> 00:14.728
 What are we doing today?

00:15.728 --> 00:19.728
 We want everyone to say that we are
cute in the morning, noon and evening.

00:20.728 --> 00:21.728
 We want everyone to say that.

00:21.728 --> 00:32.608
 That's right. So, we will introduce
summer clothes that make everyone say
that we are cute in the morning, noon
and evening.

00:33.608 --> 00:37.608
 We will choose the clothes for 10,000
yen each.

00:38.608 --> 00:40.608
 We can buy a lot of clothes.

00:41.608 --> 00:42.608
 We can buy a lot of clothes.

00:43.608 --> 00:44.608
 We can buy a lot of clothes.

00:45.608 --> 00:48.608
 We all have different styles.

00:49.608 --> 00:51.608
 We can choose what we want.

00:52.608 --> 00:53.608
 We can enjoy each style.

00:54.608 --> 00:57.608
 Let's go.

00:58.608 --> 00:59.608

01:09.608 --> 01:10.608
 We had a lot of clothes.

01:11.608 --> 01:12.608
 We had a lot of clothes.

01:13.608 --> 01:14.608
 We were so excited.

01:15.608 --> 01:16.608
 We were so excited.

01:16.608 --> 01:22.608
 We are so excited. Let's introduce
them.

01:23.608 --> 01:26.608
 This program is for 6 people who are
ready to promote something exciting.

01:26.608 --> 01:55.608
 We will challenge various things and
raise the excitement barometer in the
world.

01:56.608 --> 01:57.608
 New Day!

01:58.736 --> 02:00.736
 I'll go first.

02:00.736 --> 02:01.736
 I'll go first.

02:01.736 --> 02:02.736
 First,

02:04.736 --> 02:05.736
 I got a white shirt.

02:06.736 --> 02:07.736
 It's like a suit.

02:08.736 --> 02:09.736
 It's long.

02:10.736 --> 02:12.736
 I thought I'd buy this.

02:12.736 --> 02:14.736
 I made it long.

02:14.736 --> 02:15.736
 It's cute.

02:17.736 --> 02:18.736
 Next,

02:18.736 --> 02:19.736
 I got a top.

02:24.736 --> 02:25.736
 This is great.

02:25.736 --> 02:31.736
 I can wear this V-neck or this round
one.

02:31.736 --> 02:32.736
 Both are fine.

02:33.736 --> 02:35.736
 I can wear both.

02:35.736 --> 02:38.736
 It's great.

02:38.736 --> 02:41.296

02:41.296 --> 02:43.866
 Please subscribe to this channel.

02:44.866 --> 02:46.866
 I found a Hikaramin.

02:46.866 --> 02:48.866
 I didn't have this kind of thing.

02:49.866 --> 02:51.866
 I found a Hikaramin.

02:52.866 --> 02:54.866
 This is also Hikaramin.

02:56.866 --> 02:58.866
 I found it.

02:58.866 --> 03:00.866
 It's an interesting material.

03:00.866 --> 03:03.866
 It's like a summer material.

03:05.866 --> 03:07.866
 Next, Komodo.

03:07.866 --> 03:09.866
 It's a head.

03:09.866 --> 03:11.866
 Ta-da!

03:11.866 --> 03:13.866
 It's a basket type.

03:18.866 --> 03:21.866
 It's 590 yen when it's on sale.

03:23.866 --> 03:24.866
 I saw it.

03:24.866 --> 03:26.866
 I wore it, so I saw it.

03:28.866 --> 03:31.866
 This is a wedding dress.

03:32.866 --> 03:34.866
 It's cute.

03:34.866 --> 03:36.866
 It's a summer-like blue-kini.

03:36.866 --> 03:38.866
 What?

03:38.866 --> 03:40.866
 I wore it.

03:40.866 --> 03:42.866
 It's cute.

03:44.866 --> 03:46.866
 It's still on sale.

03:46.866 --> 03:48.866
 It's a good price.

03:48.866 --> 03:50.866
 I'll wear it more carefully.

03:50.866 --> 03:52.866
 Next, this.

03:52.866 --> 03:54.866
 It's a skirt.

03:54.866 --> 03:57.866
 I bought it because I thought it would
be good for the neck.

03:57.866 --> 03:59.866
 It opens around the neck.

03:59.866 --> 04:01.866
 Isn't it great?

04:01.866 --> 04:03.866
 I still have it.

04:03.866 --> 04:05.866
 What?

04:05.866 --> 04:08.866
 I said I'd go out, but I need that.

04:08.866 --> 04:10.866
 I said I'd go out.

04:10.866 --> 04:15.616
 What's the time now?

04:16.616 --> 04:18.616
 6 points already?

04:20.616 --> 04:21.616
 4 points!

04:21.616 --> 04:22.616
 Cute!

04:26.616 --> 04:27.616
 590 yen.

04:28.616 --> 04:29.616
 Really?

04:30.616 --> 04:31.616
 4 points!

04:34.616 --> 04:35.616
 Amazing!

04:35.616 --> 04:37.616
 Next is the last one.

04:38.616 --> 04:39.616
 Ta-da!

04:39.616 --> 04:40.616
 Oh, what?

04:40.616 --> 04:41.616
 What?

04:41.616 --> 04:42.616
 What?

04:43.066 --> 04:51.066
 I bought a bag that looks like a luxury
bag.

04:51.066 --> 04:54.066
 I bought a bag that looks like a luxury
bag.

04:54.066 --> 04:57.066
 This is all I bought.

04:57.066 --> 04:58.066
 Isn't it great?

04:58.066 --> 05:00.066
 There is more.

05:00.066 --> 05:09.066
 I bought a pair of sunglasses.

05:09.242 --> 05:11.242
 I'm going to show you the black one.

05:11.242 --> 05:13.242
 I'm going to show you the black one.

05:13.242 --> 05:15.242
 Ta-da!

05:15.242 --> 05:17.242
 Sunglasses.

05:20.242 --> 05:22.242
 It's Tanami's new clothes.

05:23.242 --> 05:24.242
 I bought it.

05:24.242 --> 05:25.242
 It's cute.

05:25.242 --> 05:26.242
 Yeah!

05:26.242 --> 05:28.160
 Thank you for watching!

05:28.160 --> 05:30.160
 I bought it for adults.

05:30.160 --> 05:32.160
 I bought it.

05:32.160 --> 05:34.160
 Great!

05:34.160 --> 05:36.160
 It's a little mature.

05:36.160 --> 05:38.160
 I bought it for adults.

05:38.160 --> 05:42.160
 Next, I will introduce what Hitoka
bought.

05:42.160 --> 05:47.160
 I bought two outfits.

05:47.160 --> 05:50.160
 One of them was this.

05:50.160 --> 05:54.160
 I had a shirt with this color.

05:54.160 --> 05:57.160
 I knew that Karami had it, so I bought
it.

05:57.160 --> 06:01.160
 I chose the one that doesn't look like
me.

06:01.160 --> 06:03.160
 The tops look like me.

06:03.160 --> 06:06.160
 I chose the cute one.

06:06.160 --> 06:09.160
 It's cute.

06:09.160 --> 06:12.160
 The sleeves are fluffy.

06:12.160 --> 06:16.160
 It's like a girlish top.

06:16.160 --> 06:19.160
 I chose the blue one.

06:19.160 --> 06:21.160
 It's cute.

06:21.160 --> 06:23.160
 I don't usually wear it.

06:23.160 --> 06:26.160
 I usually wear a surrogate.

06:26.160 --> 06:28.160
 It's cute.

06:28.160 --> 06:30.160
 It's good.

06:30.160 --> 06:33.160
 I don't usually wear a surrogate like
this.

06:33.160 --> 06:38.160
 I chose a casual one.

06:38.160 --> 06:40.160
 It's cute.

06:40.160 --> 06:41.160
 I chose it.

06:41.160 --> 06:43.160
 It's good.

06:43.160 --> 06:46.160
 I didn't buy a lot of sale items this
time.

06:46.160 --> 06:48.160
 It's cute.

06:48.160 --> 06:52.160
 The color and material are cute.

06:52.160 --> 06:57.160
 Next, I will introduce shoes.

06:57.160 --> 07:01.160
 I was wondering whether I should choose
a stylish one or not.

07:01.160 --> 07:04.160
 I chose a casual one because it's a
surrogate.

07:04.160 --> 07:07.160
 I chose this one.

07:07.160 --> 07:09.160
 It's cute.

07:09.160 --> 07:11.160
 It's easy to walk.

07:11.160 --> 07:15.160
 I chose this one.

07:15.160 --> 07:18.160
 It's cute.

07:18.160 --> 07:20.160
 Next, I will introduce a bag.

07:20.160 --> 07:24.160
 It's small.

07:24.160 --> 07:27.160
 I can wear it.

07:27.160 --> 07:30.160
 I usually wear this size.

07:30.160 --> 07:33.160
 I chose this one.

07:33.160 --> 07:36.160
 I said that it's cute in the morning
and at noon.

07:36.160 --> 07:41.160
 I chose this one because it's easy to
go to a live.

07:41.160 --> 07:43.160
 It's a casual one.

07:43.160 --> 07:46.160
 Next, I will introduce a hair band.

07:46.160 --> 07:47.160
 It's cute.

07:47.160 --> 07:49.160
 I love hair bands.

07:49.160 --> 07:52.160
 It's not black, but it's like a brown.

07:52.160 --> 07:55.160
 I chose a short one.

07:55.160 --> 07:57.160
 I want to see it.

07:57.160 --> 07:58.160
 It's cute.

07:58.160 --> 07:59.160
 I want to see it.

07:59.160 --> 08:01.160
 I will show it to you later.

08:01.160 --> 08:06.160
 Next, I will introduce a ring.

08:06.160 --> 08:08.160
 I chose this one.

08:08.160 --> 08:09.160
 It's cute.

08:09.160 --> 08:11.160
 The color is different.

08:11.160 --> 08:13.160
 It's the same shape.

08:13.160 --> 08:15.160
 It's cute.

08:15.160 --> 08:17.160
 I chose this one.

08:17.160 --> 08:19.160
 I chose this one.

08:19.160 --> 08:21.160
 It's cute.

08:21.160 --> 08:25.160
 I chose this one because it's casual.

08:25.160 --> 08:26.160
 That's all.

08:26.160 --> 08:29.160
 Next.

08:29.160 --> 08:33.160
 I will introduce a ring.

08:35.160 --> 08:38.160
 First, I will introduce the best one.

08:38.160 --> 08:42.496
 It's a dress.

08:43.496 --> 08:46.496
 It's a little bit autumn.

08:48.496 --> 08:49.496
 It's cute.

08:51.496 --> 08:54.496
 I think it's good for autumn.

08:57.496 --> 08:59.496
 I like it when I see it.

08:59.496 --> 09:01.496
 I want to match it with this.

09:01.496 --> 09:03.496
 I have another one.

09:03.496 --> 09:05.496
 The base is like this.

09:06.496 --> 09:08.496
 I'll wear it as a girl.

09:08.496 --> 09:11.496
 The chest is open.

09:12.496 --> 09:13.496
 I'll wear it as a girl.

09:14.496 --> 09:15.496
 It's a collar.

09:16.496 --> 09:20.496
 I bought a T-shirt that matches inside.

09:22.496 --> 09:25.496
 I think it goes well with anything.

09:26.496 --> 09:27.496
 I'll wear it inside.

09:29.496 --> 09:31.496
 I'll wear a belt.

09:31.496 --> 09:33.496
 I'll wear a ribbon.

09:33.496 --> 09:37.496
 I think it's good to wear it like this.

09:37.496 --> 09:47.296
 Please look forward to the next video!

09:47.296 --> 09:48.768
 Bye bye!

09:49.088 --> 09:51.088
 It's very similar to the shoes I wore
earlier.

09:51.088 --> 09:53.088
 Yeah, it's like a happy outfit.

09:54.368 --> 09:56.368
 These are sandals.

09:57.248 --> 10:04.768
 But it's a little autumn-like, so I
thought it would be better to wear them
in summer.

10:04.768 --> 10:08.048
 I chose sandals that I can wear
barefoot.

10:08.048 --> 10:10.048
 Your heels are bent because your feet
are bent.

10:10.048 --> 10:12.048
 Yeah, yeah.

10:12.048 --> 10:14.048
 I'm going to wear sandals.

10:14.048 --> 10:16.048
 I'm not good at it.

10:16.048 --> 10:18.048
 Let's go.

10:20.048 --> 10:22.048
 I got this one.

10:22.048 --> 10:24.048
 I got this one.

10:24.048 --> 10:26.048
 It's the same.

10:26.048 --> 10:28.048
 Good girls have small bags.

10:30.048 --> 10:32.048
 Good girls?

10:32.048 --> 10:34.048
 Good girls have small bags.

10:34.048 --> 10:36.048
 Good girls have small bags.

10:36.048 --> 10:38.048
 I thought it would be decided.

10:38.048 --> 10:40.048
 I'll put it in for you.

10:40.048 --> 10:42.048
 I see.

10:42.048 --> 10:44.048
 I see.

10:44.048 --> 10:46.048
 I'll put it in for you.

10:46.048 --> 10:48.048
 I see.

10:48.048 --> 10:50.048
 I thought it would be decided.

10:50.048 --> 10:52.048
 The color is the same.

10:52.048 --> 10:54.048
 It's cute.

10:54.048 --> 10:56.048
 I'll wear it with my favorite shoes.

10:56.048 --> 10:58.048
 And

10:58.048 --> 11:00.048
 I can't miss earrings.

11:00.048 --> 11:02.048
 I can't miss earrings.

11:02.048 --> 11:04.048
 I chose shell earrings.

11:04.048 --> 11:06.048
 I chose shell earrings.

11:06.048 --> 11:08.048
 I chose shell earrings.

11:08.048 --> 11:10.048
 I chose shell earrings.

11:10.048 --> 11:12.048
 I'm going to wear this one in summer.

11:12.048 --> 11:14.048
 I'm going to wear this one in summer.

11:14.048 --> 11:16.048
 I'm going to wear this one in summer.

11:16.048 --> 11:18.048
 The last one.

11:18.048 --> 11:20.048
 When I was trying on shoes,

11:20.048 --> 11:22.048
 When I was trying on shoes,

11:22.048 --> 11:24.048
 I saw this one.

11:24.048 --> 11:26.048
 It's cute.

11:26.048 --> 11:28.048
 It's cute.

11:28.048 --> 11:30.048
 It's on sale.

11:30.048 --> 11:32.048
 It's on sale.

11:32.048 --> 11:34.048
 It's on sale.

11:34.048 --> 11:36.048
 It's on sale.

11:36.048 --> 11:38.048
 It's cute.

11:38.048 --> 11:40.048
 I bought this one.

11:40.048 --> 11:42.048
 That's all.

11:43.416 --> 11:44.416
 It's good.

11:45.416 --> 11:46.416
 It's organized.

11:47.416 --> 11:48.416
 It's cute.

11:49.416 --> 11:52.416
 The color of the clothes are different.

11:54.416 --> 11:56.416
 I think it's good for a magazine.

11:57.416 --> 11:58.416
 It's a free-style.

11:59.416 --> 12:00.416
 It's cute.

12:01.416 --> 12:02.416
 I'm looking forward to it.

12:03.416 --> 12:04.416
 Can I change my clothes?

12:05.416 --> 12:08.416
 I'm going to change my clothes.

12:09.416 --> 12:10.416
 Don't look at it.

12:10.416 --> 12:11.416
 I'm going to change my clothes.

12:13.720 --> 12:17.720
 So, first of all, Hiyorin changed her
clothes.

12:19.720 --> 12:23.720
 So, let's have her on the stage.

12:26.720 --> 12:30.720
 Asahi-san, you say you're cute every
day.

12:31.720 --> 12:32.720
 I'm cute.

12:32.720 --> 12:33.720
 You're cute.

12:35.112 --> 12:37.112
 You're cute.

12:38.112 --> 12:39.112
 I want to go on a date.

12:40.112 --> 12:41.112
 Let's go on a date.

12:41.112 --> 12:42.112
 Sure.

12:43.112 --> 12:44.112
 You're cute.

12:45.112 --> 12:46.112
 I like this style.

12:47.112 --> 12:48.112
 It's a girlish style.

12:49.112 --> 12:51.112
 I tried to wear girly clothes.

12:52.112 --> 12:57.112
 One piece dress is a one-piece dress.

12:57.112 --> 13:05.112
 I want to go on a date with a small
bag.

13:06.112 --> 13:07.112
 The pin is cute.

13:08.112 --> 13:09.112
 I like it.

13:10.112 --> 13:11.112
 I put it on.

13:12.112 --> 13:13.112
 It's good.

13:14.112 --> 13:15.112
 The collar is good.

13:16.112 --> 13:17.112
 It's a lace.

13:18.112 --> 13:19.112
 It's cute.

13:19.112 --> 13:21.112
 I think it's different from other
T-shirts.

13:22.112 --> 13:23.112
 I was looking for a single collar.

13:23.112 --> 13:24.112
 I found it.

13:25.112 --> 13:26.112
 I found it.

13:27.112 --> 13:28.112
 It's a T-shirt with a collar.

13:29.112 --> 13:30.112
 It's a good T-shirt.

13:31.112 --> 13:32.112
 I think so.

13:32.112 --> 13:41.112
 The video of ten thousand yen model is
completed.

13:42.074 --> 13:44.074
 I'm sure it was a good idea.

13:44.074 --> 13:47.074
 I'll be back next time.

13:47.074 --> 13:49.074
 I'll be back.

13:49.074 --> 13:51.074
 Bye.

13:54.074 --> 13:57.074
 I don't know which one is which.

13:57.074 --> 13:59.074
 Hiyori.

13:59.074 --> 14:01.074
 Let's go on a date.

14:01.074 --> 14:04.074
 I reserved a cafe over there.

14:04.074 --> 14:05.074
 Let's go together.

14:05.074 --> 14:06.074
 Really?

14:06.074 --> 14:10.368
 Before that, let me lend you my heel.

14:11.368 --> 14:12.368
 Let me lend you my heel.

14:13.368 --> 14:14.368
 OK.

14:14.368 --> 14:16.368
 Let's go!

14:20.704 --> 14:27.704
 Next, we will call Hitoka.

14:27.704 --> 14:29.704
 Let's call her.

14:29.704 --> 14:31.704
 Hitoka.

14:31.704 --> 14:33.704
 Cute.

14:33.704 --> 14:36.704
 Say that you are cute.

14:36.704 --> 14:39.704
 Cute.

14:39.704 --> 14:41.704
 Very cute.

14:41.704 --> 14:46.704
 Isn't this outfit good?

14:46.704 --> 14:48.704
 It's a bit rough.

14:48.704 --> 14:50.704
 It's a bit rough.

14:50.704 --> 14:52.704
 Cute.

14:52.704 --> 14:54.704
 You can go anywhere.

14:54.704 --> 14:56.704
 You can do anything.

14:56.704 --> 14:59.704
 This hair is cute.

14:59.704 --> 15:01.704
 The length of the hair is cute.

15:01.704 --> 15:03.704
 The length of the hair is perfect.

15:03.704 --> 15:05.704
 It's cute.

15:05.704 --> 15:07.704
 It's cute.

15:07.704 --> 15:09.552
 Thank you.

15:10.552 --> 15:11.552
 It's good.

15:12.552 --> 15:14.552
 It's totally different.

15:15.552 --> 15:16.552
 It's a bag.

15:17.552 --> 15:18.552
 It's good.

15:21.552 --> 15:22.552
 It's good.

15:23.552 --> 15:25.552
 It's casual and cute.

15:26.552 --> 15:28.552
 It's a little bit like a summer.

15:28.552 --> 15:29.552
 I think it's good.

15:31.552 --> 15:32.552
 I think it's good.

15:33.552 --> 15:35.552
 It's easy to use.

15:35.552 --> 15:36.552
 It's good.

15:36.552 --> 15:37.552
 It's good.

15:37.552 --> 15:38.552
 It's the best.

15:41.400 --> 15:44.400
 I'm the adult version of Kanamin.

15:45.400 --> 15:47.400
 I'm going to go.

15:52.400 --> 15:55.400
 The last one is Kanamin.

15:56.400 --> 15:58.400
 Kanamin has a manly charm.

16:02.400 --> 16:04.400
 Let's read it.

16:04.400 --> 16:09.400
 Bye!

16:10.080 --> 16:13.080
 Say, I'm cute every morning and
afternoon!

16:14.080 --> 16:16.080
 Cute!

16:16.080 --> 16:18.080
 It's like a lady.

16:18.080 --> 16:20.080
 It's like a 20s.

16:20.080 --> 16:22.080
 It's like a 20s.

16:23.080 --> 16:24.080
 It's like a 20s.

16:24.080 --> 16:25.080
 It's like a 20s.

16:25.080 --> 16:26.080
 It's like a 20s.

16:26.080 --> 16:27.080
 It's like a 20s.

16:27.080 --> 16:28.080
 It's like a 20s.

16:30.080 --> 16:31.080
 It's amazing.

16:31.080 --> 16:33.080
 You can wear it in many ways.

16:33.080 --> 16:36.080
 Where is the next place?

16:36.192 --> 16:41.692
 This cardigan is a little lonely.

16:41.692 --> 16:46.192
 I think it's a little mature because of
this.

16:46.192 --> 16:48.192
 It's fashionable.

16:50.192 --> 16:52.192
 It's like a mecca.

16:52.192 --> 16:54.192
 I was able to say a lot.

16:54.192 --> 16:56.192
 I bought it from home.

16:56.192 --> 16:58.192
 I didn't buy it.

16:58.192 --> 17:00.192
 It's cute.

17:00.192 --> 17:05.192
 Do you say that we are cute every day?

17:05.192 --> 17:08.192
 We are cute.

17:08.192 --> 17:15.192
 We had a girly and mature style this
time.

17:15.192 --> 17:19.192
 I saw a different style of coordination
today.

17:19.192 --> 17:22.192
 It's a different style.

17:22.192 --> 17:30.192
 I thought that I could coordinate
various things if I went to Jiyuusei.

17:30.192 --> 17:33.192
 I will decide the theme again.

17:33.192 --> 17:37.192
 For example, black mature coordination.

17:37.192 --> 17:39.192
 Amusement park coordination.

17:39.192 --> 17:41.192
 Three-color shopping.

17:43.192 --> 17:46.192
 I thought I could do various things.

17:46.192 --> 17:51.192
 We want to do a lot of shopping at
Jiyuusei.

17:53.192 --> 17:56.192
 It's our first time to do shopping.

17:56.192 --> 17:58.192
 It was fun.

17:58.192 --> 18:01.192
 We were able to do it like YouTubers.

18:01.192 --> 18:03.192
 It was fun.

18:03.192 --> 18:07.192
 I would be happy if we could do it with
six members again.

18:07.192 --> 18:11.546
 Please subscribe to our channel!

18:11.546 --> 18:14.546
 I have an announcement!

18:14.546 --> 18:16.546
 What is it?

18:16.546 --> 18:18.546
 Is it a new announcement?

18:18.546 --> 18:21.546
 It's a scarf!

18:21.546 --> 18:24.546
 I bought this.

18:24.546 --> 18:26.546
 I wanted to wear it around my neck.

18:26.546 --> 18:30.546
 But to make it look better,

18:30.546 --> 18:33.546
 I decided to change the outfit.

18:33.546 --> 18:36.546
 I changed it to a different outfit.

18:36.546 --> 18:38.546
 It's really cute.

18:38.546 --> 18:43.546
 The back of the scarf is really cute.

18:43.546 --> 18:46.546
 So, I decided to change it to a
different outfit.

18:47.546 --> 18:49.546
 It's a simple outfit.

18:49.546 --> 18:51.546
 It's cute.

18:51.546 --> 18:53.546
 I bought too many things.

18:53.546 --> 18:55.546
 You bought a lot.

18:55.546 --> 18:57.546
 You bought a lot because you are a
member of J.Y. Park.

18:57.546 --> 18:59.546
 So, you bought too many things.

18:59.546 --> 19:01.546
 I bought all of them.

19:01.546 --> 19:03.546
 You bought all of them.

19:03.546 --> 19:05.546
 I bought all of them.

19:05.546 --> 19:08.546
 That's the announcement.

19:08.546 --> 19:13.546
 We bought a lot of things and
coordinated them.

19:13.546 --> 19:19.546
 Our mini album will be released on
September 29th.

19:19.546 --> 19:25.546
 We will collaborate with various
fashion brands on that album.

19:25.546 --> 19:28.416
 It was really fun.

19:29.416 --> 19:35.416
 We will collaborate with various
fashion brands and try on various
outfits.

19:36.416 --> 19:43.416
 It was really cute. I hope you look
forward to it.

19:44.416 --> 19:46.416
 We will show you something different
from usual.

19:47.416 --> 19:50.416
 It's different and cute.

19:50.416 --> 19:57.416
 I think you will think it's cute.

19:58.416 --> 20:02.416
 Please look forward to it.

20:02.416 --> 20:07.416
 Please look forward to it.

20:07.600 --> 20:19.760

20:19.760 --> 20:24.704
 Bye bye

20:24.704 --> 20:28.104
 I'm Naito Naito. I'm back with my
father's pension.

20:28.104 --> 20:29.704
 Normal!

20:29.704 --> 20:32.904
 A meeting with a genius boy who has
changed him.

20:32.904 --> 20:34.204
 What are you doing here?

20:34.204 --> 20:36.404
 I'm making a game here.

20:36.404 --> 20:37.104
 A game?

20:37.104 --> 20:38.804
 This is an invitation from a creator.

20:38.804 --> 20:40.104
 A creator?

20:40.104 --> 20:41.904
 A legendary game creator group.

20:41.904 --> 20:42.904
 Creators.

20:42.904 --> 20:48.204
 At first glance, it's just a normal
middle school student and a detective's
adventure story.

20:48.204 --> 20:50.604
 What is this mark?

20:50.604 --> 20:54.704
 I'll try to challenge the creator.

20:54.704 --> 20:59.704
 I'm going home.

21:01.384 --> 21:03.384
 The story of a girl who is in love with
a man

21:03.384 --> 21:04.384
 Master Soya!

21:04.384 --> 21:06.384
 Please behave yourself.

21:06.384 --> 21:08.384
 I'm just a kid.

21:09.384 --> 21:12.384
 Can she clear the game?

21:12.384 --> 21:15.384
 Watch out, Soya!

21:15.384 --> 21:18.384
 Tom & Soya in the City, Our Fortress

21:18.384 --> 21:21.384
 To be continued...

21:22.202 --> 21:28.202
 I wonder if I can walk if I don't dry
it out

21:28.202 --> 21:32.202
 Look, let's go anywhere

21:32.202 --> 21:36.202
 Goodbye, goodbye, me of yesterday

21:36.202 --> 21:40.202
 The city lights are sparkling

21:40.202 --> 21:42.202
 As if my heart is a sunny pattern

21:42.202 --> 21:44.202
 I play the sound of a puddle

21:44.202 --> 21:50.202
 And play the rainbow piano

21:51.440 --> 21:56.440
 「Rainbow Piano Sonata No.1」

21:57.440 --> 22:01.440
 I wonder why, when I smile,

22:01.440 --> 22:05.440
 the world seems to be shining

22:05.440 --> 22:09.440
 I can turn the umbrella and be relaxed

22:09.440 --> 22:13.440
 I can't walk without it

22:13.440 --> 22:16.440
 Someone is crying somewhere

22:16.440 --> 22:21.440
 I wonder if it's cold because I'm wet

22:21.440 --> 22:24.122
 Someone is crying somewhere

22:24.122 --> 22:29.522
 I want to share my feelings with you

22:29.522 --> 22:34.122
 There's still a view I've never seen
before

22:34.122 --> 22:39.122
 Let's go anywhere together

22:40.256 --> 22:44.256
 Goodbye, goodbye, thank you for
yesterday

22:44.256 --> 22:46.256
 In the city after the rain

 We are waiting

23:00.256 --> 23:03.256
 It's a lunch box

23:16.208 --> 23:22.208
 I remember the reason I cried and the
time I was lost

23:22.208 --> 23:30.208
 Even if it rains, I'll go wherever I
can to smile

23:30.208 --> 23:34.208
 Goodbye, goodbye, to me of yesterday

23:34.208 --> 23:38.208
 The city lights after the rain are
sparkling

23:38.208 --> 23:42.208
 My heart is like a sunny day, the sound
of the rain drops

23:42.208 --> 23:46.208
 And I play the rainbow piano

23:46.208 --> 23:50.208
