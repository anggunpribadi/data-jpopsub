00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Good evening, welcome to DORESKI and
KORESKI. I'm MC, Hanachii Iwai.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:06,000
I'm Kumada Akane. Thank you for having
us.

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:11,000
We have invited the members of the idol
group, BOLT, as usual.

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:12,000
BOLT.

5
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:13,000
BOLT.

6
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:18,000
BOLT, it's been 3 years since you last
came here.

7
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:23,000
Iwai, do you have any memories of this
time?

8
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:25,000
This time?

9
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:32,000
Ah, I see. You suddenly come up with
difficult questions.

10
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
That's right.

11
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
This is difficult.

12
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:37,000
Extremely difficult.

13
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:39,000
Extremely difficult questions.

14
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,000
Not everyone has such a question.

15
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,000
That's true.

16
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Then let's talk about something else.

17
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:48,800
What is it?

18
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:50,800
I bought something recently.

19
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:54,304
I was happy.

20
00:00:54,304 --> 00:00:56,304
What did you buy recently?

21
00:00:56,304 --> 00:00:57,304
What did I buy recently?

22
00:00:57,304 --> 00:00:59,304
What did I buy recently?

23
00:01:01,304 --> 00:01:02,304
TV.

24
00:01:03,304 --> 00:01:05,304
You were trying to move it around a lot.

25
00:01:05,304 --> 00:01:08,304
Yes, it was a TV that could move.

26
00:01:08,304 --> 00:01:09,304
Isn't it amazing?

27
00:01:09,304 --> 00:01:10,304
Isn't it amazing?

28
00:01:11,304 --> 00:01:14,304
The tuner is separate from the TV.

29
00:01:14,304 --> 00:01:17,304
If you have a power cord, you can move
it anywhere in the house.

30
00:01:17,304 --> 00:01:18,304
Amazing!

31
00:01:18,304 --> 00:01:19,304
You don't have to connect it to the TV.

32
00:01:20,304 --> 00:01:21,304
Isn't it amazing?

33
00:01:21,304 --> 00:01:22,304
It's amazing.

34
00:01:22,304 --> 00:01:25,304
How is it? Don't you buy a picture room?

35
00:01:25,304 --> 00:01:27,304
The picture quality is really good.

36
00:01:29,304 --> 00:01:31,304
It's the latest version of Panasonic.

37
00:01:31,304 --> 00:01:32,304
Oh, really?

38
00:01:32,304 --> 00:01:34,304
That's great.

39
00:01:35,304 --> 00:01:40,304
You can put it on the bed.

40
00:01:40,304 --> 00:01:41,304
Isn't it really good?

41
00:01:42,304 --> 00:01:45,304
Even if you try to look at it while
leaning against the wall,

42
00:01:45,304 --> 00:01:49,304
Normally, you have to face the direction
of the TV.

43
00:01:49,304 --> 00:01:52,304
Bring it straight to the front.

44
00:01:52,304 --> 00:01:53,304
It's the best.

45
00:01:53,304 --> 00:01:55,304
It's not going to get stuck in your
neck.

46
00:01:55,304 --> 00:01:56,304
That's not true.

47
00:01:57,304 --> 00:01:58,304
The neck is normal.

48
00:02:00,304 --> 00:02:05,304
So, please watch it on TV.

49
00:02:05,304 --> 00:02:06,304
What are you doing?

50
00:02:06,304 --> 00:02:08,304
Don't do it randomly.

51
00:02:09,304 --> 00:02:10,304
Let's start.

52
00:02:10,304 --> 00:02:16,304
Music variety Dresky and Koresky

53
00:02:23,194 --> 00:02:25,616
Watch the next one!

54
00:02:25,616 --> 00:02:29,616
Today's guests are the people of Bolt!

55
00:02:29,616 --> 00:02:31,616
We are Bolt!

56
00:02:31,616 --> 00:02:33,616
I'm Luna Naito!

57
00:02:33,616 --> 00:02:34,616
I'm Chihou Taka!

58
00:02:34,616 --> 00:02:35,616
I'm Aya Shirahama!

59
00:02:35,616 --> 00:02:38,616
Nice to meet you!

60
00:02:38,616 --> 00:02:40,616
This is the second week.

61
00:02:40,616 --> 00:02:42,616
Thank you!

62
00:02:42,616 --> 00:02:47,616
This time, we will introduce a new
attraction with various talk themes!

63
00:02:47,616 --> 00:02:49,616
Dorekore Box!

64
00:02:49,616 --> 00:02:55,616
Please draw from the Dorekore box!

65
00:02:55,616 --> 00:02:57,616
I will draw!

66
00:02:57,616 --> 00:02:59,616
I draw one.

67
00:02:59,616 --> 00:03:04,616
I drew two last time, so I will draw
one.

68
00:03:04,616 --> 00:03:06,616
I draw!

69
00:03:06,616 --> 00:03:09,616
This is a refreshing method.

70
00:03:09,616 --> 00:03:12,616
Is there a refreshing method?

71
00:03:12,616 --> 00:03:15,616
I have a dog.

72
00:03:15,616 --> 00:03:20,616
I have a dog, and I come home with the
dog.

73
00:03:20,616 --> 00:03:22,616
I say, I'm home!

74
00:03:22,616 --> 00:03:25,616
I give him sweets and play with him.

75
00:03:25,616 --> 00:03:28,616
I can refresh myself.

76
00:03:28,616 --> 00:03:29,616
Do you get stressed?

77
00:03:29,616 --> 00:03:31,616
I don't get stressed.

78
00:03:31,616 --> 00:03:33,616
I see.

79
00:03:33,616 --> 00:03:37,616
I have a stiff shoulder these days.

80
00:03:37,616 --> 00:03:39,616
I have a backpack.

81
00:03:39,616 --> 00:03:40,616
Really?

82
00:03:40,616 --> 00:03:42,616
I have a backpack.

83
00:03:42,616 --> 00:03:45,616
I often get my dog to step on me.

84
00:03:45,616 --> 00:03:47,616
You get your dog to step on you?

85
00:03:47,616 --> 00:03:49,616
What kind of smart dog is that?

86
00:03:49,616 --> 00:03:51,616
I get a massage.

87
00:03:51,616 --> 00:03:52,616
I see.

88
00:03:52,616 --> 00:03:53,616
You get a massage.

89
00:03:53,616 --> 00:03:54,616
Yes.

90
00:03:54,616 --> 00:03:55,616
Not a high.

91
00:03:55,616 --> 00:03:56,616
You get a massage.

92
00:03:56,616 --> 00:03:58,616
I get a massage.

93
00:03:58,616 --> 00:04:00,616
Takae, please listen to the story.

94
00:04:00,616 --> 00:04:01,616
Yes.

95
00:04:01,616 --> 00:04:05,488
I will start.

96
00:04:05,488 --> 00:04:06,488
Ta-da!

97
00:04:08,448 --> 00:04:16,448
I was disappointed.

98
00:04:16,448 --> 00:04:18,448
I'm a clumsy person.

99
00:04:18,448 --> 00:04:22,448
I was disappointed when I was 20 years
old.

100
00:04:22,448 --> 00:04:27,448
I often go on a tour at a live concert.

101
00:04:27,448 --> 00:04:31,448
I often stay alone at hotels.

102
00:04:31,448 --> 00:04:38,448
I was sleeping in the gap between the
bed and the wall.

103
00:04:38,448 --> 00:04:41,448
I had a smartphone in my hand.

104
00:04:41,448 --> 00:04:44,448
I like to play music before I go to bed.

105
00:04:44,448 --> 00:04:47,448
I was playing music on my phone.

106
00:04:47,448 --> 00:04:50,448
I was playing music on my phone.

107
00:04:50,448 --> 00:04:54,448
I couldn't put my hand in my phone.

108
00:04:54,448 --> 00:04:59,448
I called my friend for the first time.

109
00:04:59,448 --> 00:05:05,448
I was embarrassed to be asked to play my
favorite music.

110
00:05:05,448 --> 00:05:10,448
What kind of music are you listening to?

111
00:05:10,448 --> 00:05:13,448
I was listening to various people.

112
00:05:13,448 --> 00:05:20,448
I was playing music until the front came
to my room.

113
00:05:20,448 --> 00:05:22,448
I couldn't stop playing music.

114
00:05:22,448 --> 00:05:25,448
Your music is playing.

115
00:05:25,448 --> 00:05:29,448
I was surprised.

116
00:05:33,448 --> 00:05:36,448
This is a comment from an artist.

117
00:05:36,448 --> 00:05:41,448
What did you just say?

118
00:05:41,448 --> 00:05:46,448
Did you say the comment from an artist?

119
00:05:46,448 --> 00:05:50,448
Did you say the comment from an artist?

120
00:05:50,448 --> 00:05:56,448
This is a comment from a singer.

121
00:05:56,448 --> 00:06:01,448
Please enjoy the recording.

122
00:06:01,448 --> 00:06:11,738
Please enjoy the recording.

123
00:06:11,738 --> 00:06:14,738
Hello, viewers of Doreski and Kore-Ski.

124
00:06:14,738 --> 00:06:19,738
I'm Ishihara Kaori, voice actor.

125
00:06:19,738 --> 00:06:31,738
I'm a character called Minions.

126
00:06:31,738 --> 00:06:41,738
I've never liked a mascot before, but I
fell in love with it for the first time
in my life and went to see it in the US.

127
00:06:41,738 --> 00:06:46,738
I'm an artist.

128
00:06:46,738 --> 00:06:54,738
On August 3rd, I released my 9th single,
Musouteki Chronicle and my 10th single,
Abra Kadabu.

129
00:06:54,738 --> 00:07:01,738
Musouteki Chronicle is a song that gives
you courage when you start something.

130
00:07:01,738 --> 00:07:09,738
Abra Kadabu is a cool song that loves
his loved ones.

131
00:07:09,738 --> 00:07:16,738
Both songs have completely different
tastes, so I expressed it in the music
video.

132
00:07:16,738 --> 00:07:27,738
Musouteki Chronicle is a refreshing and
dramatic music video that makes you cry.

133
00:07:27,738 --> 00:07:34,738
Abra Kadabu is a cool dance that is very
connected to the camera.

134
00:07:34,738 --> 00:07:39,738
It's a music video that makes you want
to keep your eyes on it.

135
00:07:39,738 --> 00:07:42,738
Please watch it.

136
00:07:42,738 --> 00:07:47,738
That's all from me, Ishihara Kaori.

137
00:07:48,528 --> 00:07:50,528
Next Episode

138
00:07:50,528 --> 00:07:52,528
Next, please.

139
00:07:52,528 --> 00:07:55,664
Thank you.

140
00:07:55,664 --> 00:08:01,664
I'm not good at things.

141
00:08:01,664 --> 00:08:08,664
I had a chance to go to a amusement park
at school.

142
00:08:08,664 --> 00:08:10,664
I went with everyone at school.

143
00:08:10,664 --> 00:08:15,664
I'm not good at ghost houses.

144
00:08:15,664 --> 00:08:17,664
I can't go to a ghost house.

145
00:08:17,664 --> 00:08:23,664
I don't like the atmosphere of ghosts.

146
00:08:23,664 --> 00:08:28,664
I went in with a friend.

147
00:08:28,664 --> 00:08:33,664
My friend asked me to shake hands.

148
00:08:33,664 --> 00:08:36,664
I was given a mission to shake hands.

149
00:08:36,664 --> 00:08:40,664
I was surprised to hear that.

150
00:08:40,664 --> 00:08:42,664
I asked my friend to shake hands.

151
00:08:42,664 --> 00:08:44,664
Did you shake hands with a ghost?

152
00:08:44,664 --> 00:08:49,664
I was told to shake hands with a ghost.

153
00:08:49,664 --> 00:08:54,664
I was surprised to hear that.

154
00:08:54,664 --> 00:08:58,664
I was surprised to hear that.

155
00:08:58,664 --> 00:09:02,664
I laughed more than I was scared of
ghosts.

156
00:09:02,664 --> 00:09:04,664
I was able to go to a ghost house.

157
00:09:04,664 --> 00:09:06,664
I'm happy.

158
00:09:06,664 --> 00:09:09,664
What is your recent hobby?

159
00:09:09,664 --> 00:09:14,664
I eat with Takaichiho.

160
00:09:14,664 --> 00:09:20,664
You take pictures of food with
Takaichiho's check.

161
00:09:20,664 --> 00:09:23,664
I'm addicted to it.

162
00:09:23,664 --> 00:09:30,664
Fans often take pictures of food with
our check.

163
00:09:30,664 --> 00:09:35,664
I take pictures like a hamburger.

164
00:09:35,664 --> 00:09:38,664
I also admired it.

165
00:09:38,664 --> 00:09:44,664
I got a check from a member.

166
00:09:44,664 --> 00:09:46,664
I always carry it with me.

167
00:09:46,664 --> 00:09:52,664
I also take pictures of delicious food
with Takaichiho's check.

168
00:09:52,664 --> 00:09:54,664
You are a bad person.

169
00:09:54,664 --> 00:09:56,664
You are a bad person.

170
00:09:56,664 --> 00:09:58,664
I'm a bad person.

171
00:09:58,664 --> 00:10:01,664
I am a bad person.

172
00:10:01,664 --> 00:10:07,664
I am always eaten by Takaichiho.

173
00:10:07,664 --> 00:10:09,664
You are different.

174
00:10:09,664 --> 00:10:11,664
I'm addicted to it.

175
00:10:11,664 --> 00:10:15,664
I don't like your check.

176
00:10:15,664 --> 00:10:19,664
I want you to tell me what kind of check
you have.

177
00:10:19,664 --> 00:10:29,178
Please look forward to it.

178
00:10:29,178 --> 00:10:34,178
On August 10th, the first EP, Weather,
was released!

179
00:10:34,178 --> 00:10:35,178
Congratulations!

180
00:10:35,178 --> 00:10:36,178
Thank you!

181
00:10:36,178 --> 00:10:38,178
What kind of EP is it?

182
00:10:38,178 --> 00:10:50,178
The title is Weather, but it's an EP
that has a lot of songs that have
changed depending on the weather and the
feelings that change depending on the
environment.

183
00:10:50,178 --> 00:11:00,178
Even if you listen to all the songs,
it's an EP that you can listen to in 19
minutes.

184
00:11:00,178 --> 00:11:06,178
It's a total of 6 songs, but I'd like
you to listen to it.

185
00:11:06,178 --> 00:11:12,178
If you make it shorter, it's about 30
seconds.

186
00:11:12,178 --> 00:11:18,178
It's a short time, isn't it?

187
00:11:18,178 --> 00:11:24,178
Among them, By My Side is also the
opening theme of DOREKORE August.

188
00:11:24,178 --> 00:11:27,178
Thank you!

189
00:11:27,178 --> 00:11:30,178
Please tell us the charm of this song.

190
00:11:30,178 --> 00:11:49,178
This song is a song that is also in the
MV, but it has a pop and punk feel like
a go-bot, and the lyrics are strong, but
it's a little embarrassing.

191
00:11:49,178 --> 00:11:51,178
Please listen to it a lot.

192
00:11:51,178 --> 00:11:53,178
That's great. Thank you.

193
00:11:53,178 --> 00:11:57,178
And what kind of feeling is it in the
MV?

194
00:11:57,178 --> 00:12:02,178
The weather was really nice on the day
we shot the MV.

195
00:12:02,178 --> 00:12:08,178
So we shot the MV in the blue sky and
our costumes.

196
00:12:08,178 --> 00:12:16,178
It's really popular, and if there's a
facial expression that everyone looks
really happy with the lyrics,

197
00:12:16,178 --> 00:12:26,178
In the scene where we're dressed cool
and cool, the dance is really intense,
so it's a perfect music video for the
summer.

198
00:12:26,178 --> 00:12:28,178
That's also a point of interest.

199
00:12:31,824 --> 00:12:35,824
So, Kumada-san, Bolt-san, you came to
Nishu, how was it?

200
00:12:35,824 --> 00:12:39,824
Everyone was so cute, and I felt like I
was a big sister.

201
00:12:39,824 --> 00:12:41,824
I agree.

202
00:12:41,824 --> 00:12:47,824
Shirahama-san, you're a middle schooler,
so you really want to raise your
allowance.

203
00:12:47,824 --> 00:12:50,824
I feel like I'm a relative.

204
00:12:50,824 --> 00:12:52,824
Yeah, like a relative.

205
00:12:52,824 --> 00:12:54,824
I'll buy you things you want.

206
00:12:54,824 --> 00:12:58,824
I'll buy you the latest clothes for your
classmate.

207
00:12:58,824 --> 00:13:00,824
That's so nice.

208
00:13:00,824 --> 00:13:03,824
I'll make you the most rich classmate.

209
00:13:03,824 --> 00:13:04,824
That's nice.

210
00:13:04,824 --> 00:13:05,824
I think so.

211
00:13:05,824 --> 00:13:07,824
That's a great love.

212
00:13:07,824 --> 00:13:09,824
You're a big brother.

213
00:13:09,824 --> 00:13:14,824
Iwai-san, we'll read a message from a
viewer.

214
00:13:14,824 --> 00:13:17,824
It's from Oden-dan.

215
00:13:17,824 --> 00:13:19,824
Thank you.

216
00:13:19,824 --> 00:13:21,824
Good evening, Kumada-san and Iwai-san.

217
00:13:21,824 --> 00:13:28,824
The other day, I went to B's concert,
and the bassist of the support members
was so cool that I was struck by his
heart.

218
00:13:28,824 --> 00:13:36,824
What kind of person would you like to
have as a support member, like Harai-chi
and Kumada-san's music activities?

219
00:13:36,824 --> 00:13:37,824
B's.

220
00:13:37,824 --> 00:13:39,824
I knew it was B's.

221
00:13:39,824 --> 00:13:41,824
B's?

222
00:13:41,824 --> 00:13:43,824
Yeah.

223
00:13:43,824 --> 00:13:45,824
I didn't know that for the first time.

224
00:13:45,824 --> 00:13:47,824
What kind of person?

225
00:13:47,824 --> 00:13:51,824
I'd like someone who's bright.

226
00:13:53,824 --> 00:13:55,824
I don't want a dark support member.

227
00:13:55,824 --> 00:13:58,824
That's true.

228
00:13:58,824 --> 00:14:00,824
The whole thing gets dark.

229
00:14:00,824 --> 00:14:01,824
That's right.

230
00:14:01,824 --> 00:14:04,824
We have a lot of rehearsals.

231
00:14:04,824 --> 00:14:07,824
I want someone who's bright.

232
00:14:07,824 --> 00:14:10,824
When I say, who's the support guitar?

233
00:14:10,824 --> 00:14:14,824
I'm sorry.

234
00:14:14,824 --> 00:14:20,824
If you do that, I think you'll stop the
live.

235
00:14:20,824 --> 00:14:22,824
I think I'll be shocked.

236
00:14:22,824 --> 00:14:25,824
I don't want you to pay attention to me.

237
00:14:25,824 --> 00:14:31,824
I want someone who says, let's get
excited.

238
00:14:31,824 --> 00:14:34,824
I want a support member who's like a
support.

239
00:14:34,824 --> 00:14:35,824
That's right.

240
00:14:35,824 --> 00:14:41,824
I want a support member who knows that
you're just a support.

241
00:14:41,824 --> 00:14:43,824
I'm so surprised.

242
00:14:43,824 --> 00:14:53,824
You didn't have the ability to form a
band and be able to perform on stage.

243
00:14:53,824 --> 00:14:55,824
That's why you're a support.

244
00:14:55,824 --> 00:14:57,824
I'm surprised.

245
00:14:57,824 --> 00:15:00,824
You want a support member, right?

246
00:15:00,824 --> 00:15:03,824
I'm not saying that.

247
00:15:03,824 --> 00:15:04,824
I'm not saying that.

248
00:15:04,824 --> 00:15:08,824
You're a support member because you
can't be the main.

249
00:15:08,824 --> 00:15:10,824
Please stop it.

250
00:15:10,824 --> 00:15:13,824
I'm saying that we should work together.

251
00:15:13,824 --> 00:15:18,824
You want someone who's bright.

252
00:15:18,824 --> 00:15:19,824
I'm sorry.

253
00:15:19,824 --> 00:15:20,824
I'm bright.

254
00:15:20,824 --> 00:15:22,824
I want a bright person.

255
00:15:22,824 --> 00:15:24,824
I'm sorry.

256
00:15:24,824 --> 00:15:27,824
How many stickers do you give to Oden-
dan?

257
00:15:27,824 --> 00:15:33,824
I give you 10 stickers.

258
00:15:33,824 --> 00:15:37,824
We are looking for messages and requests
for the show.

259
00:15:37,824 --> 00:15:42,824
Please send it to the official website
of the program.

260
00:15:46,048 --> 00:15:49,048
Kumada Kokuchi chance!

261
00:15:50,640 --> 00:15:54,640
If you can answer the question
correctly, you can get a notice.

262
00:15:54,640 --> 00:15:55,640
Thank you.

263
00:15:55,640 --> 00:15:57,640
Let's start. Quiz about Saitama.

264
00:15:57,640 --> 00:15:58,640
Yes.

265
00:15:58,640 --> 00:16:04,640
Which of the following is the
catchphrase of the city's image?

266
00:16:04,640 --> 00:16:08,640
A. Sukusuku City, Saitama City

267
00:16:08,640 --> 00:16:12,640
B. Nobi Nobi City, Saitama City

268
00:16:12,640 --> 00:16:17,640
C. Anshin Anzen Heiwana Machi, Saitama
City

269
00:16:17,640 --> 00:16:18,640
Which one?

270
00:16:18,640 --> 00:16:21,640
This is...

271
00:16:21,640 --> 00:16:24,640
This is something that a great person
would think of, right?

272
00:16:24,640 --> 00:16:25,640
Yes.

273
00:16:25,640 --> 00:16:28,640
I don't know if a great person would
think of this.

274
00:16:28,640 --> 00:16:29,640
Really?

275
00:16:29,640 --> 00:16:30,640
I don't know.

276
00:16:30,640 --> 00:16:33,640
It's an image catchphrase, so I might
have asked for it.

277
00:16:33,640 --> 00:16:35,640
Oh, you might have asked for it.

278
00:16:35,640 --> 00:16:38,640
I don't know.

279
00:16:38,640 --> 00:16:40,640
I said I don't know.

280
00:16:40,640 --> 00:16:44,640
Oh, no.

281
00:16:44,640 --> 00:16:50,640
Yes. C. Anshin Anzen Heiwana Machi,
Saitama City

282
00:16:50,640 --> 00:16:51,640
Final answer.

283
00:16:51,640 --> 00:16:54,480
Yes, it's the final answer.

284
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:56,480
You got it right.

285
00:16:58,992 --> 00:17:01,992
The answer is B, Nobinovisty Saitama
City.

286
00:17:01,992 --> 00:17:03,992
Nobinovisty Saitama City?

287
00:17:04,992 --> 00:17:06,992
Is it a recruitment?

288
00:17:07,992 --> 00:17:09,992
You mean it's lame?

289
00:17:09,992 --> 00:17:11,992
Like a fool?

290
00:17:11,992 --> 00:17:12,992
No, but...

291
00:17:12,992 --> 00:17:14,992
If you think about the great people, it
can't be like this.

292
00:17:14,992 --> 00:17:16,992
The official name was C, right?

293
00:17:16,992 --> 00:17:18,992
I don't know.

294
00:17:18,992 --> 00:17:20,992
I thought all of them were good.

295
00:17:20,992 --> 00:17:22,992
I thought so, too.

296
00:17:22,992 --> 00:17:25,992
But you thought Sukusuku and Nobinovisty
were like fools, right?

297
00:17:25,992 --> 00:17:26,992
I didn't know.

298
00:17:26,992 --> 00:17:28,992
It's actually Nobinovisty.

299
00:17:29,992 --> 00:17:31,992
That's what they say.

300
00:17:31,992 --> 00:17:33,992
Can you read it for me?

301
00:17:33,992 --> 00:17:35,992
I wanted to announce it.

302
00:17:35,992 --> 00:17:37,992
You did?

303
00:17:37,992 --> 00:17:38,992
No, you can't.

304
00:17:38,992 --> 00:17:40,992
You can't do it if you can't answer the
question.

305
00:17:41,992 --> 00:17:42,992
The next one is the best.

306
00:17:42,992 --> 00:17:43,992
No.

307
00:17:43,992 --> 00:17:46,176
Goodbye.
