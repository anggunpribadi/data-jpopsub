 About you and me

03:06.000 --> 03:10.000
 The spring of my head is too short

03:10.000 --> 03:15.000
 When your voice reaches me

03:15.000 --> 03:18.000
 I feel like I'm dreaming

04:52.384 --> 04:56.384
 No, it's the day when all the time is
wasted.

04:58.384 --> 05:00.384
 I was suddenly called.

05:00.384 --> 05:02.384

05:37.402 --> 05:39.402
 It's fine.

05:39.402 --> 05:41.402
 The sound is not good.

05:41.402 --> 05:43.402
 The echo is gone.

05:43.402 --> 05:45.402
 Everyone is so cute.

05:45.402 --> 05:47.402
 The sound is not good.

 Manager.

05:56.504 --> 05:58.504
 It's a cute poster.

05:58.504 --> 06:00.504
 It's like a house.

06:01.504 --> 06:03.504
 Yoko's house.

06:03.504 --> 06:09.504
 It's a live menu.

06:10.554 --> 06:16.554
 First, we would like to toast to the
release of Doki Doki Music Festival!

06:22.874 --> 06:24.874
 Let's introduce ourselves.

07:24.346 --> 07:26.346
 I have a special camera.

07:27.346 --> 07:29.346
 Please, have a look.

07:31.346 --> 07:32.346
 It's a special camera.

07:32.346 --> 07:32.512
 Hiyori's special camera

 Roger that!

07:39.672 --> 07:41.672
 We hope you enjoy it!

07:44.026 --> 07:46.026
 Let's drink.

07:46.026 --> 07:48.026
 What do you want?

07:48.026 --> 07:50.026
 Peach and Muscat.

07:50.026 --> 07:52.026
 Who wants peach?

07:52.026 --> 07:54.026
 Peach.

07:54.026 --> 07:56.026
 Yes.

07:56.026 --> 07:58.026
 What does it taste like?

07:58.026 --> 08:00.026
 It's like amber.

08:00.026 --> 08:02.026
 It's beautiful.

08:02.026 --> 08:04.026
 I don't choose peach.

08:04.026 --> 08:06.026
 Is this okay?

08:06.026 --> 08:07.994
 Yes.

08:07.994 --> 08:09.994
 Did I put too much?

08:09.994 --> 08:11.994
 Anyone who likes it?

08:11.994 --> 08:13.994
 Yes!

08:15.994 --> 08:17.994
 Let's put a little less at first.

08:17.994 --> 08:19.994
 Is it okay?

08:19.994 --> 08:21.994
 There's another one.

08:23.994 --> 08:25.994
 Thank you.

08:25.994 --> 08:27.994
 That's nice.

08:27.994 --> 08:29.994
 It's tickling.

08:29.994 --> 08:31.994
 I was talking a lot last year.

08:31.994 --> 08:33.994
 I was talking a lot.

08:33.994 --> 08:35.994
 I was talking a lot last year.

08:35.994 --> 08:36.602
 I was talking a lot.

08:36.602 --> 08:37.602
 Cider?

08:37.602 --> 08:39.602
 Yeah, last year on top of food.

08:39.602 --> 08:41.602
 Chicken was sweet.

08:42.602 --> 08:43.602
 Oh!

08:43.602 --> 08:44.602
 It's open!

08:50.602 --> 08:51.602
 Pan pan pan pan.

08:51.602 --> 08:55.354
 It smells good.

08:55.354 --> 08:57.354
 It smells like a mask.

08:57.354 --> 08:58.354
 It smells good.

08:58.354 --> 09:00.354
 Can I have a cup?

09:01.354 --> 09:02.354
 Shall we read the comments?

09:02.354 --> 09:03.354
 Yes.

09:04.354 --> 09:05.354
 Cheers.

09:07.354 --> 09:08.354
 Flaming.

09:08.354 --> 09:10.354
 Cheers for the anniversary.

09:10.354 --> 09:11.354
 Who is this?

09:11.354 --> 09:12.354
 Everyone, please.

09:12.354 --> 09:14.354
 Everyone, please.

09:14.354 --> 09:16.354
 It's okay to drink.

09:17.354 --> 09:18.354
 It smells good.

09:18.354 --> 09:21.936
 Please turn on the sound.

09:22.936 --> 09:30.936
 December 23rd, we will release our
first album, Tokimeki Goods.

09:30.936 --> 09:33.936
 Please hold this cup.

09:35.936 --> 09:38.936
 Cheers!

09:38.936 --> 09:44.936
 Cheers!

09:52.346 --> 09:55.346
 The muscat is strong.

09:55.346 --> 09:58.346
 It's good.

09:58.346 --> 10:00.346
 How is it?

10:00.346 --> 10:03.346
 It's good. I drank muscat.

10:03.346 --> 10:05.346
 Oh, really?

10:05.346 --> 10:07.346
 I drank peach.

10:09.346 --> 10:11.346
 It's good.

10:13.346 --> 10:15.346
 Cheers!

10:15.346 --> 10:17.346
 I prepared a cider for December.

10:17.346 --> 10:19.346
 Oh, you prepared it.

10:19.346 --> 10:21.552
 Cheers!

10:21.552 --> 10:23.552

 Good morning.

11:09.954 --> 11:10.954
 I'm going to sleep.

11:10.954 --> 11:13.954
 It's time to sleep.

11:13.954 --> 11:15.738
 I'm going to sleep.

11:15.738 --> 11:17.738
 We're close.

11:19.738 --> 11:21.738
 We're close.

11:21.738 --> 11:23.738

11:25.738 --> 11:27.738

11:27.738 --> 11:29.738

11:29.738 --> 11:31.738
 I think you're on Twitter.

11:31.738 --> 11:33.738
 Where?

11:33.738 --> 11:35.738
 Are you on Twitter?

11:35.738 --> 11:37.738
 You can post a picture of yourself.

11:37.738 --> 11:39.738
 And,

11:39.738 --> 11:41.738
 I'll tell you what I've been up to
lately.

11:41.738 --> 11:43.456
 I'm a big fan of Master.

11:43.456 --> 11:46.776
 She went back to shop on Christmas but

11:48.016 --> 11:50.276
 Her body muscles were like

11:50.276 --> 11:51.796
 Better than before

11:52.636 --> 11:55.976
 She even went on diet

11:55.976 --> 11:58.916
 And tried to lose weight

11:59.376 --> 12:03.056
 We'll go through the lyrics

12:03.056 --> 12:06.056
 What about Yuyuko?

12:06.240 --> 12:11.240
 For example, recently I dropped a
flower on Kana's head.

12:11.240 --> 12:13.240
 Waffle chicken?

12:14.240 --> 12:16.240
 I heard a great voice.

12:16.240 --> 12:18.240
 Waffle chicken?

12:19.240 --> 12:27.240
 Waffle chicken is a dish with chicken
on top of waffles and maple syrup.

12:27.240 --> 12:31.240
 I was wondering what it would taste
like, sweet or salty.

12:31.240 --> 12:34.032
 It was very good.

12:35.032 --> 12:41.032
 The waffle was crispy and the chicken
was salty.

12:41.032 --> 12:47.032
 The balance of sweet and salty was
good.

12:47.032 --> 12:49.032
 It was very good.

12:52.032 --> 12:56.032
 The chicken on top was also very good.

12:57.032 --> 12:58.032
 It was a good match.

12:58.032 --> 13:03.032
 I usually don't sit there, but I
sometimes sit there.

13:04.296 --> 13:06.296
 I want to eat it.

13:06.296 --> 13:08.296
 That's what I want.

13:08.296 --> 13:09.296
 That's right.

13:09.296 --> 13:12.296
 I want to eat something, not food.

13:12.296 --> 13:15.296
 I'm OK without food.

13:15.546 --> 13:18.546
 I was so excited watching this stream.

13:18.546 --> 13:20.546
 I was so happy.

13:20.546 --> 13:21.546
 I was so happy.

13:21.546 --> 13:22.546
 Huh?

13:22.546 --> 13:23.546
 Huh?

13:25.546 --> 13:26.546
 What was that?

13:26.546 --> 13:27.546
 What was that?

13:27.546 --> 13:29.546
 I was so happy.

13:29.546 --> 13:33.546
 Please tweet anything you want.

13:33.546 --> 13:37.546
 The members might introduce the tweet
later.

13:37.546 --> 13:38.546
 Yes.

13:38.546 --> 13:41.546
 Please tweet as many times as you want.

13:41.546 --> 13:43.546
 Please tweet a lot.

13:43.546 --> 13:44.546
 Please tweet a lot.

13:44.546 --> 13:44.666
 Please tweet a lot.

13:44.666 --> 13:46.666
 I'll put it on right away.

13:46.666 --> 13:47.666
 Really?

13:47.666 --> 13:49.666
 Ramen!

13:49.666 --> 13:51.666
 It's delicious!

13:51.666 --> 13:53.666
 Great!

13:53.666 --> 13:55.666
 It's a lot of eggs.

13:55.666 --> 13:57.666
 It looks delicious.

13:57.666 --> 13:59.666
 The members are eating it all by
themselves.

13:59.666 --> 14:01.666
 I'm jealous.

14:01.666 --> 14:07.226
 I love eggs.

14:07.226 --> 14:09.226
 This is cute.

14:09.226 --> 14:11.226
 Can I read it?

14:11.226 --> 14:15.226
 The moment I got excited recently, I
was a nursery teacher.

14:15.226 --> 14:17.226
 A crybaby in the nursery told me,

14:17.226 --> 14:21.226
 I won't cry anymore when I get married
to my teacher.

14:21.226 --> 14:23.226
 That's great.

14:23.226 --> 14:25.226
 That's great.

14:25.226 --> 14:27.226
 That's great.

14:27.226 --> 14:29.226
 That's great.

14:29.226 --> 14:31.226
 That's great.

14:31.226 --> 14:32.992
 Thank you.

14:33.992 --> 14:36.992
 I've been listening to this since I was
little.

14:37.992 --> 14:39.992
 What would it be like if I were an
adult?

14:40.992 --> 14:41.992
 It's so romantic.

14:44.992 --> 14:46.992
 I'm going to tell you.

14:47.992 --> 14:48.992
 I love you.

14:48.992 --> 14:50.992
 I won't let you go.

14:59.992 --> 15:00.992
 I'm going to tell you.

15:02.056 --> 15:03.056
 I don't know.

15:03.056 --> 15:05.056

15:39.698 --> 15:41.698
 It's time for Ruki to start

15:41.698 --> 15:44.698
 She was all ready to sing

15:44.698 --> 15:45.698
 No Мар engages in talking

15:45.698 --> 15:47.698
 I wasn't ready

15:52.698 --> 15:53.050
 What did I just sing just now?

15:53.050 --> 15:55.050
 I'm so happy!

15:55.050 --> 15:57.050
 I met Tsuda Aki-chan!

15:58.050 --> 16:00.050
 I met Minami-chan!

16:01.050 --> 16:03.050
 Haruka is the cutest!

16:05.050 --> 16:06.050
 What's so funny?

16:06.050 --> 16:08.050
 I'm not smiling.

16:12.050 --> 16:13.050
 Haruka is the cutest!

16:13.050 --> 16:14.050
 Thank you!

 It's started!

16:23.280 --> 16:27.280
 Hiori's Oh My God! T.U.K.M.J!

16:29.280 --> 16:30.280
 It was fun!

16:30.280 --> 16:31.280
 It was great!

16:31.280 --> 16:32.280
 It was the best!

16:32.280 --> 16:33.280
 It was fun!

16:34.280 --> 16:35.280
 It was great!

16:35.280 --> 16:36.280
 It was great!

16:37.280 --> 16:39.280
 I was a little bit nervous.

16:39.280 --> 16:40.280
 I was a little bit nervous.

16:41.280 --> 16:42.280
 Hiori was a little bit nervous.

16:42.280 --> 16:43.280
 I was a little bit nervous.

16:43.280 --> 16:44.280
 I was a little bit nervous.

16:44.280 --> 16:46.280
 See you again!

16:46.746 --> 16:48.746
 Please watch it when it's over.

16:48.746 --> 16:51.746
 And when I was doing my best with my
bare face,

16:51.746 --> 16:55.746
 Hiyori-chan was laughing with her
shoulders like this.

16:56.746 --> 16:58.746
 It was funny.

16:58.746 --> 17:00.746
 That's funny.

17:01.746 --> 17:07.746
 We always appear in the U-JIBU, so we
only did the behind-the-scenes.

17:08.746 --> 17:15.746
 Everyone, please leave a comment or a
Twitter after the live.

17:15.746 --> 17:16.154
 Bye-bye!

 Anime!

17:16.954 --> 17:17.874
 No!!

17:18.734 --> 17:20.894
 Well then, I'll go next!

17:21.114 --> 17:25.254
 So this time has been a super heacity

17:25.394 --> 17:26.994
 all the Natsuhime Riko's first solo
debut

17:27.134 --> 17:32.594
 So, we'll show everyone, musicals a bit
ahead of their solos

17:32.594 --> 17:33.394
 Here they are!

17:34.274 --> 17:35.074
 strands of strands

17:36.454 --> 17:38.394
 I've already whispered

17:38.834 --> 17:39.494
 Strand!

17:39.694 --> 17:40.594
 Strands.

17:41.954 --> 17:42.774
 Strand?

17:43.374 --> 17:43.894
 Ah.

17:44.194 --> 17:45.314
 To Strand...

17:45.314 --> 17:45.882
 I love you!

17:45.882 --> 17:47.882
 That's weird.

17:49.882 --> 17:51.882
 I found it!

17:53.882 --> 17:55.882
 I was waiting for it.

17:57.882 --> 17:59.882
 I won't let go!

17:59.882 --> 18:01.882
 I won't let go!

18:02.874 --> 18:03.874
 I won't let go!

18:03.874 --> 18:08.874
 Once I bite it, I won't let go!

18:09.626 --> 18:11.626
 Let's do it!

18:11.626 --> 18:13.626
 Let's go back to the beginning.

18:13.626 --> 18:15.626
 Let's start with this.

18:15.626 --> 18:17.626
 Let's start with Kagamin.

18:17.626 --> 18:19.626
 I'll start.

18:19.626 --> 18:24.626
 I'll introduce the songs in order.

18:24.626 --> 18:26.626
 The first song is...

18:26.626 --> 18:33.626
 Tumorou!

18:33.626 --> 18:35.626
 Yes, that's right.

18:35.626 --> 18:37.626
 Um, yes, that's right.

18:37.626 --> 18:42.626
 Before that, here's an video of my
album.

18:42.650 --> 18:44.650
 It's dangerous.

18:47.650 --> 18:49.650
 We just sang when we introduced
ourselves.

18:50.650 --> 18:52.650
 We haven't even gone to sleep yet.

18:54.650 --> 18:57.650
 Let's have pizza.

 My precious feelings

 Forever and ever

 I think I can be by your side

19:43.386 --> 19:45.386
 Please subscribe to my channel!

19:52.378 --> 19:56.378
 I don't think I can achieve my dreams

19:56.378 --> 20:01.378
 Give up or be confused

20:01.378 --> 20:03.378
 Right now, call me back, call me boy

20:03.378 --> 20:08.378
 Let me hear your voice, sing a song

20:08.538 --> 20:09.978
 If you fall in love,

20:09.978 --> 20:11.538
 Shake it up! Shake it up!

20:11.538 --> 20:13.098
 Feel good, shake it up!

20:13.098 --> 20:16.338
 The number of layers is like a love
bootcamp

20:16.338 --> 20:19.058
 Lose weight, lose weight, lose weight

20:19.058 --> 20:21.978
 Don't forget to replenish water

20:21.978 --> 20:22.978
 I won't let go

20:24.738 --> 20:26.138
 Lion Girl

20:26.138 --> 20:28.418
 Shake your hair

20:28.418 --> 20:29.818
 Lion Girl

20:29.818 --> 20:32.098
 Run through the wilderness

20:32.098 --> 20:33.538
 Lion Girl

20:33.538 --> 20:35.778
 A beauty scream

20:35.778 --> 20:37.312
 Lion Girl

20:37.312 --> 20:41.792
 Beautiful eyes, July cider

20:41.792 --> 20:44.792
 The night you spilled it

20:44.792 --> 20:48.392
 I can't forget it at any time

20:48.392 --> 20:50.032
 It hurts, it hurts

20:50.032 --> 20:53.562
 I want to erase my painful everyday

20:53.562 --> 20:55.562
 I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

20:55.562 --> 20:57.562
 It's all my fault.

20:57.562 --> 20:59.562
 I walked alone.

20:59.562 --> 21:01.562
 I remember the pain of the journey.

21:04.122 --> 21:06.622
 It's because of this summer

21:25.754 --> 21:35.754
 I'm not sure if I can say that I'm
scared or that I'm crying

21:35.754 --> 21:40.754
 Let's go, go, let's go, let's go
forward with our voices out!

21:40.754 --> 21:44.754
 If you're feeling down, let's go
together

21:44.754 --> 21:50.754
 Let's go, go, let's go, let's go
forward with our voices out!

21:50.754 --> 21:55.754
 If you're feeling down, let's go
together

21:55.754 --> 22:00.754
 One, two, three, we can overcome
anything

22:00.754 --> 22:05.754
 Go! To the future!

22:06.170 --> 22:10.170
 Let's go! We are the delivery girls!

22:10.170 --> 22:13.170
 Let's fly! Aiming for your heart!

22:13.170 --> 22:17.170
 Like a butterfly, DASH! Like a bee,
SING!

22:17.170 --> 22:19.170
 We'll sneak in and steal it!

22:19.170 --> 22:25.170
 Let's go! We'll always run through with
all our might!

22:25.170 --> 22:31.170
 We'll engrave the meaning deep in our
hearts!

22:31.170 --> 22:32.122
 Hey!

22:32.122 --> 22:35.122
 Let's go anywhere

22:38.122 --> 22:40.122
 Goodbye, goodbye

22:40.122 --> 22:42.122
 Thank you for yesterday

22:42.122 --> 22:46.122
 The city after the rain is colorful

22:46.122 --> 22:48.122
 On the canvas of my damaged heart

22:48.122 --> 22:50.122
 I draw a fragment of the future

22:50.122 --> 22:54.122
 It will guide me

22:57.056 --> 23:04.056
 Because I fell in love with you

23:04.056 --> 23:09.356
 Love will soon turn into love

23:09.356 --> 23:14.956
 A simple happiness that's only complex

23:14.956 --> 23:16.710
 My heart is satisfied

23:16.710 --> 23:19.710
 I want to stop more

23:19.710 --> 23:23.710
 It's a pain, this feeling

23:23.710 --> 23:25.710
 Your shaker

23:25.710 --> 23:30.710
 Spin more, spin more

23:30.710 --> 23:33.710
 Spin more, spin more

23:33.710 --> 23:36.710
 Spin more, heart shaker

23:36.710 --> 23:41.710
 Spin more, spin more

23:41.710 --> 23:46.710
 Spin more, spin more

23:46.710 --> 23:52.710
 Spin more, spin more

24:00.858 --> 24:02.858
 It's good.

24:02.858 --> 24:05.858
 So, we've watched the teaser.

24:05.858 --> 24:11.858
 This video will be uploaded to APEX's
YouTube channel by the end of this week.

24:11.858 --> 24:14.858
 So please look forward to it.

24:15.858 --> 24:18.858
 Now, let's look back.

24:18.858 --> 24:20.858
 I think I said my name earlier.

24:20.858 --> 24:22.858
 It's okay.

24:24.858 --> 24:25.858
 Ta-da!

24:25.858 --> 24:29.858
 M1, the strongest set of the world!

24:32.616 --> 24:34.616
 The strongest set!

24:34.616 --> 24:37.616
 Hello! Hello!

24:39.680 --> 24:41.680
 I'm so excited!

24:42.680 --> 24:43.680
 I'm so excited!

24:43.680 --> 24:44.680
 I'm so excited!

24:44.680 --> 24:45.680
 I'm so excited!

24:46.680 --> 24:54.680
 This song is our first single and also
our first single.

24:55.680 --> 24:59.680
 It's a song that makes you feel
positive and positive.

24:59.680 --> 25:04.680
 We get energy from this song when we
perform live.

25:04.680 --> 25:10.680
 I think this song will give courage to
many people.

25:13.656 --> 25:17.656
 I think many people have listened to
this song.

25:17.656 --> 25:21.656
 The music video is also uploaded.

25:22.656 --> 25:27.656
 Please listen to this song a lot.

25:28.656 --> 25:30.656
 Let's listen to the second song.

25:31.656 --> 25:33.656
 The second song is...

25:33.656 --> 25:39.656
 See you at Shibuya!

25:41.408 --> 25:46.408
 This is the first time I'm performing
at K-Town SuperFu.

25:46.408 --> 25:51.408
 I've also performed in front of you at
the Yukan concert.

25:51.408 --> 25:54.408
 I'm sure many of you have heard it
before.

25:54.408 --> 25:59.408
 The best part of this song is the
melody.

25:59.408 --> 26:01.408
 The lyrics are very...

26:01.408 --> 26:04.408
 When you think about yourself,

26:04.408 --> 26:08.408
 you can feel a lot of things coming to
your mind.

26:08.408 --> 26:11.408
 There are many lyrics that you can
relate to.

26:11.408 --> 26:12.408
 The lyrics are...

26:12.408 --> 26:14.408
 This is it!

26:14.408 --> 26:17.408
 This is a really good song.

26:17.408 --> 26:19.408
 I hope you listen to it more and more.

26:19.408 --> 26:23.408
 I hope you can make it a better song.

26:23.408 --> 26:26.408
 I've heard it 5,000 times.

26:26.408 --> 26:27.408
 Wow!

26:27.408 --> 26:29.408
 It's a great song!

26:29.408 --> 26:31.408
 It's a good song.

26:31.408 --> 26:32.408
 It's Shibuya.

26:32.408 --> 26:33.408
 Fabrin is...

26:33.408 --> 26:35.408
 That's right!

26:35.408 --> 26:37.408
 Is there anyone who likes it?

26:37.408 --> 26:40.408
 I'm sure there are people who have
heard it.

26:40.408 --> 26:42.408
 I want you to tweet it.

26:42.408 --> 26:43.408
 I'll read the comments.

26:43.408 --> 26:45.408
 I'll say,

26:45.408 --> 26:48.408
 It's amazing that you're going to
Shibuya Tsutaya by yourself.

26:48.408 --> 26:49.408
 That's right!

26:49.408 --> 26:52.408
 It's an official song.

26:52.408 --> 26:56.408
 It's an official song of Shibuya
Tsutaya.

26:56.408 --> 26:58.408
 I remember the choreography.

26:58.408 --> 27:00.408
 Wow!

27:00.408 --> 27:04.408
 It's something you can easily
choreograph.

27:04.408 --> 27:06.408
 The dance video is also uploaded to
YouTube.

27:06.408 --> 27:08.408
 Please watch it.

27:08.408 --> 27:10.408
 There's a shuwa in it.

27:10.408 --> 27:11.408
 That's right!

27:11.408 --> 27:14.408
 There's a shuwa in it.

27:14.408 --> 27:17.408
 Next, please.

27:17.408 --> 27:19.408
 What I'm going to introduce in the
world is...

27:19.408 --> 27:23.408
 Drum rolls!

27:23.408 --> 27:26.408
 Ta-ta-ta-ta-ta!

27:26.408 --> 27:28.408
 Oh, I'm sorry.

27:28.408 --> 27:34.408
 This is the first song I've ever heard
from Taneguchi Maguro.

27:34.408 --> 27:38.408
 It's a lead song of this song.

27:38.408 --> 27:40.408
 I'm glad.

27:40.408 --> 27:44.408
 Did you all watch the music video?

27:44.408 --> 27:46.408
 I saw it.

27:46.408 --> 27:49.408
 Everyone is so cute.

27:49.408 --> 27:52.408
 It's not just cute, it's a little sad.

27:52.408 --> 27:58.408
 It's a music video that's a mixture of
everyday life and non-ordinary life.

27:58.408 --> 28:02.408
 It's a great music video no matter how
many times you watch it.

28:02.408 --> 28:07.408
 If you haven't seen it yet, please
watch it a lot.

28:07.408 --> 28:11.408
 This song is really...

28:11.408 --> 28:17.408
 It's a song that tells you that there's
no ceiling on the second floor.

28:17.408 --> 28:25.408
 It's a pop song that anyone can listen
to.

28:25.408 --> 28:31.408
 Let's listen to this song a lot and get
excited together.

28:31.408 --> 28:37.408
 Everyone posted a picture of us
meeting.

28:37.408 --> 28:39.408
 I'm wearing a bubble wrap.

28:42.408 --> 28:44.408
 It's funny.

28:44.408 --> 28:47.408
 It's a very sad picture.

28:47.408 --> 28:49.408
 I'm crying.

28:49.408 --> 28:52.408
 The part of Endless Calamity makes me
cry.

28:52.408 --> 28:53.408
 Thank you.

28:53.408 --> 28:55.408
 I'll replay it.

28:55.408 --> 28:57.408
 I saw it on Twitter.

28:57.408 --> 29:01.408
 I love Hito-chan's tears so much that I
can cry.

29:01.408 --> 29:05.408
 Endless's music video is too good.

29:05.408 --> 29:07.408
 It's too good.

29:07.408 --> 29:14.408
 The person who posted a picture of us
with Pabrin is taking pictures.

29:14.408 --> 29:16.408
 I'm still there.

29:16.408 --> 29:20.408
 You can take a picture with us, so
please take a picture of us.

29:20.408 --> 29:22.408
 It's rare.

29:22.408 --> 29:25.408
 I can't take a picture with you all the
time.

29:25.408 --> 29:27.408
 I don't need money.

29:30.408 --> 29:34.408
 I took a picture with Pabrin.

29:34.408 --> 29:40.408
 I want to go to the toilet, but I
can't.

29:40.408 --> 29:44.408
 If you like, please take a picture of
us.

29:46.408 --> 29:48.408
 I'll play the fourth song.

29:48.408 --> 29:51.408
 The fourth song is this.

29:51.408 --> 29:54.408
 It's a super version of Koe no Seipan.

29:54.408 --> 30:03.408
 Super version is a new song that AKI
added.

30:03.408 --> 30:08.408
 AKI's voice is also included in the
super version of Koe no Seipan.

30:08.408 --> 30:10.408
 A new shape up has been released.

30:10.408 --> 30:12.408
 I wonder if anyone has heard of it.

30:12.408 --> 30:21.408
 Koe no Seipan is a diet song for
dancing and singing.

30:21.408 --> 30:26.408
 When I first heard this song, the staff
told me to lose weight.

30:26.408 --> 30:28.408
 I thought it was a song.

30:30.408 --> 30:35.408
 It's a song that makes you want to move
your body.

30:35.408 --> 30:39.408
 My cousin is listening to this song in
the bath.

30:39.408 --> 30:41.408
 In the bath?

30:41.408 --> 30:44.408
 It's a song that makes you feel like
you're going to break.

30:44.408 --> 30:50.408
 It's a song that I recommend to people
who want to lose weight.

30:50.408 --> 30:56.408
 I was running when I couldn't work
outside.

30:56.408 --> 31:01.408
 I often ran while listening to Koe no
Seipan.

31:01.408 --> 31:03.408
 I thought I had to lose weight.

31:03.408 --> 31:05.408
 It's hard to lose weight.

31:09.408 --> 31:12.408
 It's a song that can be exciting even
at a live concert.

31:12.408 --> 31:14.408
 Please look forward to it at the live
concert.

31:14.408 --> 31:16.408
 I really lost weight.

31:16.408 --> 31:20.408
 I'm fine.

31:20.408 --> 31:22.408
 I'm fine.

31:22.408 --> 31:24.408
 I'm fine.

31:24.408 --> 31:26.408
 I ate a lot.

31:26.408 --> 31:29.408
 I ate hamburgers and steaks in the
morning.

31:29.408 --> 31:32.408
 It's not a hamburger.

31:32.408 --> 31:34.408
 It's a hamburger and a steak.

31:34.408 --> 31:36.408
 It's a hamburger and a steak.

31:36.408 --> 31:42.408
 After the lesson, I went home and ate a
hamburger.

31:42.408 --> 31:44.408
 I'm fine.

31:44.408 --> 31:46.408
 I'm fine.

31:46.408 --> 31:48.408
 I ate a gratin.

31:50.408 --> 31:54.408
 I ate a teriyaki that my mother ate
after that.

31:54.408 --> 31:55.408
 I ate a lot.

31:55.408 --> 31:57.408
 Everyone, I'm eating in the bath.

31:57.408 --> 31:59.408
 Don't worry.

31:59.408 --> 32:04.000
 Next song.

32:05.000 --> 32:08.000
 M5? M5!

32:08.000 --> 32:10.000
 Lion Girl!

32:10.000 --> 32:12.000
 This is a new song.

32:12.000 --> 32:16.000
 Did you listen to Lion Girl?

32:18.120 --> 32:25.120
 This song is a new style that we
haven't done before.

32:25.120 --> 32:28.120
 It's a song about a strong girl.

32:28.120 --> 32:33.120
 We will never let the advertisers go.

32:33.120 --> 32:38.120
 We will keep singing this song.

32:38.120 --> 32:48.120
 We can't show you our dance yet, but
it's fun.

32:48.120 --> 32:53.120
 And you can be like this.

32:53.120 --> 32:57.120
 Please look forward to it.

32:57.120 --> 32:59.120
 You said you wouldn't let go.

32:59.120 --> 33:02.120
 You listened to it.

33:02.120 --> 33:03.120
 I did.

33:03.120 --> 33:08.120
 Some people listened to it.

33:08.120 --> 33:10.120
 Some people listened to it yesterday.

33:10.120 --> 33:16.120
 After Hito-chan's line, there are many
people who say,

33:16.120 --> 33:18.120
 「More! Johnny!」

33:18.120 --> 33:21.120
 I listened to it on earphones the other
day.

33:21.120 --> 33:25.120
 I don't know the lyrics.

33:25.120 --> 33:29.120
 Please listen to it on earphones.

33:29.120 --> 33:32.120
 Next.

33:32.120 --> 33:35.120
 The 6th song is...

33:35.120 --> 33:38.120
 「Saija of July」

33:38.120 --> 33:43.120
 All the songs are good.

33:43.120 --> 33:48.120
 There are many members who like this
song.

33:48.120 --> 33:50.120
 It's a popular song.

33:50.120 --> 33:59.120
 It's a collaboration song with Natali.

33:59.120 --> 34:06.120
 It was created by the song.

34:06.120 --> 34:14.120
 It's a song written by Okurei Sakuno.

34:14.120 --> 34:20.120
 It's a song about a summer love.

34:20.120 --> 34:27.120
 It's a song that comes straight from
the intro.

34:27.120 --> 34:30.120
 There's a point that Aki-chan likes.

34:30.120 --> 34:32.120
 Yes.

34:32.120 --> 34:34.120
 My favorite point is...

34:34.120 --> 34:40.120
 The end of the chorus and the end of
the second chorus.

34:40.120 --> 34:46.120
 The part where you say 「Ah 」 is not a
hiragana.

34:46.120 --> 34:50.120
 Look at the lyrics.

34:50.120 --> 34:53.120
 It's not a hiragana.

34:53.120 --> 34:58.120
 I think it's good to use kanji.

34:58.120 --> 35:02.120
 Please listen to it while looking at
the lyrics.

35:02.120 --> 35:06.120
 The dance is also a point.

35:06.120 --> 35:09.120
 I haven't shown you yet.

35:09.120 --> 35:11.120
 No.

35:11.120 --> 35:15.120
 It's better to enjoy the dance.

35:15.120 --> 35:17.120
 Well...

35:17.120 --> 35:21.120
 What was that?

35:21.120 --> 35:23.120
 It's a cute dance.

35:23.120 --> 35:27.120
 So please enjoy it.

35:27.120 --> 35:33.120
 Please enjoy it at the live show.

35:33.120 --> 35:42.120
 Shizuoka-chan wrote 「Bo」 before.

35:42.120 --> 35:44.120
 What is 「Bo」?

35:44.120 --> 35:46.120
 I made a mistake.

35:46.120 --> 35:48.120
 It's my part.

35:48.120 --> 35:54.120
 I drank it all.

35:54.120 --> 36:02.120
 It's a cute hint.

36:02.120 --> 36:07.120
 It's scary when you're young.

36:07.120 --> 36:11.120
 Lion girl also said this.

36:11.120 --> 36:15.120
 「Tatte ga miyurashite」

36:15.120 --> 36:17.120
 I'm embarrassed.

36:17.120 --> 36:19.120
 This is not good.

36:19.120 --> 36:23.120
 It's too detailed to be transmitted.

36:23.120 --> 36:26.120
 This is Shizuoka.

36:26.120 --> 36:30.120
 I can't hide it.

36:30.120 --> 36:34.120
 I can't hide it.

36:34.120 --> 36:38.120
 I can't control myself.

36:38.120 --> 36:41.120
 I'm embarrassed.

36:41.120 --> 36:45.120
 Next is Sakura-san.

36:45.120 --> 36:47.904
 Please look forward to the next video!

36:48.904 --> 36:51.904
 This song is provided by Aoi Yamazaki.

36:52.904 --> 37:01.904
 This song is a song that comes to my
mind when I hear it in the time of April
or farewell.

37:02.904 --> 37:12.904
 It's a song that I'll be separated from
my friends while looking back on the
memories of various schools.

37:12.904 --> 37:21.904
 But it's a song that pushes me back to
the next future.

37:22.904 --> 37:24.904
 It gives me a lot of courage.

37:25.904 --> 37:36.904
 I'm going to do my best to go down the
path I've chosen.

37:37.904 --> 37:40.904
 It's a song for those who are looking
forward to their graduation.

37:40.904 --> 37:45.904
 The choreography is also very good.

37:46.904 --> 37:52.904
 It's not just a sharp dance, but it's
also a bit flexible.

37:53.904 --> 37:57.904
 It's a song that shows a little
feminine side.

37:58.904 --> 38:00.904
 Don't switch here.

38:01.904 --> 38:03.904
 It's a special song.

38:04.904 --> 38:07.904
 I'm lonely.

38:07.904 --> 38:09.904
 Let's go to the next song.

38:10.904 --> 38:12.904
 The camera has changed.

38:13.904 --> 38:16.904
 It's a song that everyone sings in the
chorus.

38:17.904 --> 38:21.904
 It's a song that's been a hit in the
spring.

38:22.904 --> 38:24.904
 There were a lot of solos.

38:25.904 --> 38:27.904
 It's a song that's been a hit.

38:27.904 --> 38:37.904
 It's a song like this.

38:38.904 --> 38:40.904
 Let's read the chat.

38:41.904 --> 38:45.904
 The comments are fun.

38:46.904 --> 38:48.904
 Is it a special camera for spoilers?

38:48.904 --> 38:56.904
 It's a special camera for spoilers.

38:57.904 --> 38:59.904
 I'm going to say everything that comes
out.

39:02.904 --> 39:04.904
 It would be nice if you could see the
water.

39:05.904 --> 39:09.904
 I saw a comment saying that I like
Sakura.

39:10.904 --> 39:12.904
 Please write a spoiler.

39:13.904 --> 39:15.904
 You don't have to read the chat about
spoilers.

39:15.904 --> 39:17.904
 I like Sakura.

39:18.904 --> 39:20.904
 I like Haachan.

39:21.904 --> 39:23.904
 I like Lion Girl.

39:24.904 --> 39:26.904
 I'm looking at something else.

39:28.904 --> 39:30.904
 Are you on Twitter?

39:31.904 --> 39:33.904
 Please tweet.

39:34.904 --> 39:36.904
 Please tweet a lot.

39:37.904 --> 39:39.904
 Please add two.

39:39.904 --> 39:44.904
 Please add a lot of tweets.

39:45.904 --> 39:47.904
 It's a trend.

39:54.904 --> 39:58.904
 I'm graduating next spring, so I'll
listen to Sakura a lot.

39:58.904 --> 40:04.904
 I'm going to listen to Sakura's
graduation song.

40:05.904 --> 40:07.904
 Let's move on to the next song.

40:09.904 --> 40:13.904
 Please tell your friends to listen to
it.

40:15.904 --> 40:17.904
 Please tweet.

40:18.904 --> 40:20.904
 It's a funny spring.

40:20.904 --> 40:26.904
 Next, I like the dance of the song.

40:27.904 --> 40:29.904
 Please look forward to it.

40:30.904 --> 40:35.904
 Next is the victory story of Super
Akimeki Senren.

40:36.904 --> 40:42.904
 This is a song that has a power-up on
the title and song title.

40:43.904 --> 40:48.904
 This song is also a song that has Aki's
voice in it.

40:48.904 --> 40:50.904
 It's a long song.

40:51.904 --> 40:58.904
 The song was called Victory Story.

40:59.904 --> 41:05.904
 The name is also a song that will
continue to walk the path of victory.

41:06.904 --> 41:10.904
 This song is also a song that will
cheer you up.

41:10.904 --> 41:17.904
 Please listen to the new version of the
song.

41:19.904 --> 41:23.904
 Please look forward to the victory
story of Toki-kun.

41:25.904 --> 41:27.904
 Are you going to do it?

41:27.904 --> 41:33.856
 Thank you for watching.

41:39.968 --> 41:41.968
 Come here.

41:41.968 --> 41:43.968
 Come here.

41:43.968 --> 41:45.968
 I'm still young.

41:47.968 --> 41:49.968
 Come here.

41:49.968 --> 41:51.968
 Come here.

41:51.968 --> 41:53.968
 Come here.

41:55.968 --> 41:57.968
 What's going on?

41:57.968 --> 41:59.968
 You're cute.

41:59.968 --> 42:01.968
 You're cute.

42:03.968 --> 42:05.968
 You're cute.

42:05.968 --> 42:07.968
 You're good.

42:09.968 --> 42:11.968
 You're good.

42:11.968 --> 42:13.968
 You're good.

42:13.968 --> 42:15.968
 You're good.

42:15.968 --> 42:17.968
 You're fresh.

42:17.968 --> 42:19.968
 You have more friends.

42:19.968 --> 42:21.968
 Come here.

42:21.968 --> 42:23.968
 Welcome.

42:23.968 --> 42:25.968
 You're the leader.

42:25.968 --> 42:27.968
 I'm the leader.

42:29.968 --> 42:31.968
 May I listen to it?

42:31.968 --> 42:33.968
 I'll listen to it.

42:33.968 --> 42:35.968
 You're cute.

42:43.360 --> 42:47.320
 delivery store!

42:47.320 --> 42:50.320
 Also, you can discuss in this place.

42:51.380 --> 42:52.380
 Dubai Toyů

42:52.380 --> 42:54.380
 Thank you Arigato.

42:54.380 --> 42:55.232
 Yaaayee!

42:55.232 --> 42:57.232
 Yay yay yay yay!

42:57.232 --> 43:01.232
 We've performed this song many times,

43:01.232 --> 43:04.232
 but it's a song that we're really
excited about.

43:04.232 --> 43:08.232
 It's a song that you can enjoy without
thinking about anything.

43:08.232 --> 43:11.232
 This song was provided to us by

43:11.232 --> 43:15.232
 the member of the group, Nanigiri-san.

43:15.232 --> 43:20.232
 It's a song that has a lot of members
in it.

43:20.232 --> 43:25.232
 So, let's cheer up and be energetic
today!

43:25.232 --> 43:28.232
 I'm saying what I like.

43:28.232 --> 43:31.232
 Ryoshikawa-san, you like what you say.

43:31.232 --> 43:33.232
 And also,

43:33.232 --> 43:35.232
 we're eating, right?

43:35.232 --> 43:37.232
 The 21st century of Harapeko.

43:37.232 --> 43:40.232
 There are a lot of members in the
lyrics.

43:40.232 --> 43:43.232
 And not only the song,

43:43.232 --> 43:47.232
 but also the dance has a lot of
highlights.

43:47.232 --> 43:50.232
 Karumin is showing off her acrobatics.

43:50.232 --> 43:54.232
 And Julia is showing off her
throbbing...

43:54.232 --> 43:56.232
 fan!

43:56.232 --> 44:00.232
 She's showing off her throbbing fan.

44:00.232 --> 44:03.232
 And Hitoka, Haru, and Piyo are

44:03.232 --> 44:05.232
 doing something that I'm really into.

44:05.232 --> 44:06.232
 Did you notice?

44:06.232 --> 44:08.232
 It's the first time for the third
generation.

44:08.232 --> 44:11.232
 I'm the main melody.

44:11.232 --> 44:13.232
 That's right.

44:13.232 --> 44:15.232
 And who's the lowest?

44:15.232 --> 44:19.232
 I'm the lowest, and Piyo is the main.

44:19.232 --> 44:21.232
 And Takahito is...

44:21.232 --> 44:23.232
 I thought I was the main.

44:23.232 --> 44:25.232
 That's a good thing.

44:25.232 --> 44:30.232
 I thought I was the main.

44:30.232 --> 44:34.232
 I thought I was the main when I was
smiling.

44:34.232 --> 44:36.232
 I didn't expect that.

44:36.232 --> 44:39.232
 I thought,

44:39.232 --> 44:41.232
 but I didn't want to make a mistake.

44:41.232 --> 44:43.232
 So I said, yes.

44:43.232 --> 44:45.232
 It's embarrassing.

44:45.232 --> 44:48.232
 Why are you so careful?

44:48.232 --> 44:50.232
 I'm the highest?

44:50.232 --> 44:53.232
 I didn't think I was the highest.

44:53.232 --> 44:56.232
 I thought either of us was singing
higher.

44:56.232 --> 44:57.232
 No, no.

44:57.232 --> 44:59.232
 Too high.

45:02.232 --> 45:04.232
 Opera?

45:04.232 --> 45:06.232
 Center?

45:08.232 --> 45:10.232
 I laughed too much.

45:10.232 --> 45:15.232
 But there are so many good songs.

45:15.232 --> 45:18.232
 I don't know if this is a good song.

45:18.232 --> 45:20.232
 Please look forward to it.

45:23.232 --> 45:26.232
 Let's move on to the 10th song.

45:26.232 --> 45:30.232
 The 10th song is GAMUSHARA's Super
Version.

45:30.232 --> 45:35.232
 This is the first GAMUSHARA with Aki's
voice.

45:35.232 --> 45:40.232
 As the title says, it's a GAMUSHARA
song.

45:45.232 --> 45:48.232
 It's a GAMUSHARA song.

45:48.232 --> 45:53.232
 It's a song that sings about us.

45:53.232 --> 45:57.232
 We are also working hard every day.

45:57.232 --> 46:02.232
 It's a song that sings about us.

46:02.232 --> 46:07.232
 It's a song that cheers up the hearts
of GAMUSHARA.

46:07.232 --> 46:09.232
 Please listen to it.

46:09.232 --> 46:11.232
 Please listen to it.

46:13.232 --> 46:15.232
 Aki, you're not in the picture.

46:17.232 --> 46:20.232
 Let's move on to the next song.

46:20.232 --> 46:26.232
 Next is M11's Ameagari.

46:26.232 --> 46:28.232
 It's a new song.

46:28.232 --> 46:29.232
 It's Ameagari.

46:29.232 --> 46:32.232
 Did you listen to it?

46:32.336 --> 46:35.336
 Everyone, please listen to this intro.

46:38.938 --> 46:42.938
 This intro is also very cute.

46:42.938 --> 46:50.938
 It's like walking in a puddle.

46:50.938 --> 46:57.938
 I only listened to the title song of
this song.

46:57.938 --> 47:10.938
 I imagined walking in a puddle with an
umbrella.

47:10.938 --> 47:12.938
 Then the title song is called Amemari.

47:12.938 --> 47:16.938
 I thought it was a very nice song.

47:16.938 --> 47:28.938
 This song is a song that says, even if
your heart is cloudy like rain, it will
definitely be sunny, so it's okay.

47:28.938 --> 47:31.938
 It's full of very positive lyrics.

47:31.938 --> 47:34.938
 The lyrics are very cute.

47:34.938 --> 47:41.938
 It's a very cute lyrics that says, play
the rainbow piano or wear the rainbow
dress.

47:41.938 --> 47:46.938
 Please listen to a lot of lyrics and
songs and cheer up.

47:50.648 --> 47:52.648
 I'm looking at Twitter.

47:54.648 --> 47:57.648
 Hitochan part of GAMUSHADA is cool.

47:58.648 --> 47:59.648
 Thank you.

48:00.648 --> 48:02.648
 I want to play the piano with you.

48:03.648 --> 48:05.648
 Are you a person who can play the
piano?

48:06.648 --> 48:08.648
 I want to play with you.

48:09.648 --> 48:12.648
 When I hear the song, my heart becomes
clear.

48:13.648 --> 48:16.648
 I'm glad to hear that.

48:16.648 --> 48:17.648
 I'm glad to hear that.

48:18.648 --> 48:20.648
 Let's listen to the last song.

48:20.648 --> 48:22.648
 The last song is...

48:26.584 --> 48:28.584
 We love you all!

48:28.584 --> 48:32.584
 We are Seishun Heart Shaker!

48:33.584 --> 48:34.584
 We love you!

48:34.584 --> 48:38.584
 Everyone knows how we react to the
live.

48:38.584 --> 48:39.584
 What do you mean?

48:39.584 --> 48:41.584
 I don't care anymore!

48:41.584 --> 48:42.584
 We haven't seen it yet.

48:42.584 --> 48:44.584
 It's been a long time.

48:46.584 --> 48:47.584
 What's that?

48:47.584 --> 48:48.584
 It wasn't on the screen.

48:48.584 --> 48:49.584
 It was on the screen!

48:49.584 --> 48:50.584
 It was on the screen!

48:50.584 --> 48:51.584
 It was on the screen!

48:51.584 --> 48:52.584
 It was on the screen!

48:52.584 --> 48:55.584
 You're so good at it!

48:55.584 --> 48:58.584
 We are Seishun Heart Shaker!

48:58.584 --> 48:59.584
 No, we're not!

49:00.584 --> 49:01.584
 We were like this just now.

49:01.584 --> 49:04.584
 Everyone, you haven't seen us yet.

49:05.584 --> 49:07.584
 Look at us.

49:07.584 --> 49:10.584
 We're looking at the floor when it
starts.

49:13.584 --> 49:17.584
 We are Seishun Heart Shaker.

49:17.584 --> 49:18.584
 What's that?

49:22.584 --> 49:26.584
 Speaking of the song, it's a mix of
love and spirit.

49:26.584 --> 49:30.584
 Of course, it's a great song.

49:30.584 --> 49:32.584
 I'll make you laugh!

49:33.584 --> 49:35.584
 I can't remember the song.

49:36.584 --> 49:38.584
 The fans are watching.

49:38.584 --> 49:41.584
 I don't usually do this, but...

49:43.584 --> 49:46.584
 I like Heart Shaker more.

49:46.584 --> 49:47.584
 I'm going to cry.

49:47.584 --> 49:51.584
 Isn't the word Heart Shaker really
good?

49:51.584 --> 49:52.584
 It's good.

49:52.584 --> 49:53.584
 It's a heart-shaking dance.

49:53.584 --> 50:00.584
 There's a choreography where we shake
our bodies.

50:00.584 --> 50:03.584
 We say, turn it more and more.

50:03.584 --> 50:12.584
 There's a lot of choreography that we
can do together with the main dancer.

50:12.584 --> 50:15.584
 Do you do this song?

50:15.584 --> 50:19.584
 Do you do this Heart Shaker?

50:19.584 --> 50:20.584
 I don't know.

50:22.584 --> 50:23.584
 You don't know?

50:26.584 --> 50:27.584
 You don't know?

50:27.584 --> 50:28.584
 I don't know.

50:29.584 --> 50:30.584
 Do you do it?

50:30.584 --> 50:31.584
 Do you do it?

50:33.584 --> 50:35.584
 You do it, right?

50:37.584 --> 50:40.584
 You can't say that.

50:40.584 --> 50:42.584
 I'll do it.

50:43.584 --> 50:45.584
 You don't know, do you?

50:45.584 --> 50:47.584
 I said it as the leader.

50:49.584 --> 50:51.584
 I'm the leader of the leader.

50:51.584 --> 50:53.584
 I'm so nervous.

50:54.584 --> 50:56.584
 Please give me a towel.

50:57.584 --> 50:59.584
 That's how you become a leader.

51:01.584 --> 51:02.584
 I'll pull it out.

51:02.584 --> 51:05.584
 Lala Lala

51:07.584 --> 51:09.584
 Don't open it.

51:12.584 --> 51:14.584
 I'm doing it slowly.

51:14.584 --> 51:17.584
 It's fun to have so much fun.

51:18.584 --> 51:21.584
 I introduced it earlier, so I'll
introduce this.

51:22.584 --> 51:24.584
 It's in my hand.

51:24.584 --> 51:25.584
 Tissue is in my hand.

51:25.584 --> 51:27.584
 This is so fashionable.

51:27.584 --> 51:30.584
 Please hold this one by one.

51:30.584 --> 51:32.584
 There are six, so please introduce
them.

51:32.584 --> 51:34.584
 I haven't introduced Hiori yet.

51:36.584 --> 51:38.584
 Let's introduce it together.

51:44.584 --> 51:46.584
 What is Kanami's?

51:48.584 --> 51:51.584
 This is a flower everyone has.

51:51.584 --> 51:57.584
 This is a flower from Saitama Super
Arena.

51:59.112 --> 52:01.112
 The live CD is being recorded.

52:01.112 --> 52:03.112
 Yes, it's a live version of Tamawari
Kiku.

52:08.112 --> 52:10.112
 We'll see it later.

52:10.112 --> 52:12.112
 We'll introduce it later.

52:13.112 --> 52:16.112
 We'll be performing Tamawari Kiku live.

52:20.112 --> 52:21.112
 We'll see it later.

52:21.112 --> 52:27.112
 How about this side?

52:30.458 --> 52:32.458
 What is this?

52:32.458 --> 52:34.458
 I see.

52:34.458 --> 52:36.458
 I'm looking forward to it.

52:36.458 --> 52:38.458
 Please subscribe to my channel.

52:39.992 --> 52:44.992
 The sound source of the live
performance is recorded as a CD.

52:45.992 --> 52:51.992
 You can listen to it while imagining
the live performance.

52:52.992 --> 52:57.992
 It's the first time for Toki-san to
listen to the sound source of the live
performance as a CD.

53:00.992 --> 53:06.992
 If you come to the live performance,
you can listen to it while imagining the
live performance.

53:06.992 --> 53:17.992
 If you haven't come to the live
performance yet, you can listen to it
while imagining the live performance.

53:18.992 --> 53:21.992
 Please listen to it.

53:22.992 --> 53:25.992
 Next, this is the CD.

53:25.992 --> 53:27.776
 Please listen to it.

53:27.776 --> 53:40.776
 This CD is a CD that you can watch the
video of ZEPP HANEDA, which we did at
the debut live show.

53:45.690 --> 53:47.690
 I can't see it well.

53:51.690 --> 53:53.690
 If you can see it, please take a look.

53:55.690 --> 54:00.690
 There is a picture of how it was.

54:00.690 --> 54:02.690
 Please take a look.

54:02.690 --> 54:04.690
 This CD is amazing.

54:08.690 --> 54:10.690
 This is amazing, too.

54:10.690 --> 54:12.690
 This is amazing, too.

54:13.690 --> 54:15.690
 Please take a look.

54:16.690 --> 54:18.690
 What is the first one?

54:18.690 --> 54:23.690
 This is a picture of everyone holding
flowers.

54:23.690 --> 54:25.690
 This is a picture taken from above.

54:25.690 --> 54:36.690
 This is a video of the live performance
at the Saitama Super Arena.

54:36.690 --> 54:46.690
 The live performance was held at the
Saitama Super Arena.

54:46.690 --> 54:51.690
 If you haven't seen it, please take a
look.

54:51.690 --> 54:54.690
 I saw it a while ago.

54:54.690 --> 54:55.690
 What did you see?

54:55.690 --> 54:57.690
 I saw it.

54:57.690 --> 54:58.690
 What did you see?

54:59.690 --> 55:00.690
 I saw it.

55:00.690 --> 55:01.690
 What are you looking at?

55:02.690 --> 55:05.690
 I made a little arrangement.

55:05.690 --> 55:07.690
 Please take a look.

55:07.690 --> 55:09.690
 I saw it.

55:09.690 --> 55:11.690
 This is cute.

55:11.690 --> 55:13.690
 This is cute.

55:13.690 --> 55:15.690
 This is cute.

55:15.690 --> 55:16.690
 What about Julia?

55:16.690 --> 55:18.690
 This is cute.

55:20.690 --> 55:22.690
 This is Julia.

55:22.690 --> 55:26.224
 Please take a look.

55:27.224 --> 55:28.224
 It's okay.

55:29.224 --> 55:30.224
 It's okay.

55:30.224 --> 55:31.224
 Let's take a look at the intro later.

55:31.224 --> 55:32.224
 Which page?

55:35.224 --> 55:36.224
 Is there something in it?

55:37.224 --> 55:38.224
 No.

55:39.224 --> 55:40.224
 Can't we show this?

55:41.224 --> 55:42.224
 Did you put it out?

55:46.224 --> 55:47.224
 No.

55:48.224 --> 55:49.224
 Maybe there's something that's not in
it.

55:50.224 --> 55:52.224
 No, maybe I'll twist it once.

55:52.224 --> 55:54.224
 There's something that's not in it.

55:56.488 --> 55:59.488
 It's in the menu.

55:59.488 --> 56:03.488
 I see.

56:04.760 --> 56:06.760
 She's coming!

56:10.760 --> 56:11.760
 She's coming!

56:11.760 --> 56:12.760
 I see!

56:13.760 --> 56:15.760
 You're so cool!

56:15.760 --> 56:17.760
 I'm trying to make it up.

56:18.760 --> 56:20.760
 I just got it.

56:21.760 --> 56:23.760
 Some people don't know what I'm talking
about.

56:23.760 --> 56:25.760
 I'm not wrong.

56:25.760 --> 56:27.760
 You're sweating.

56:27.760 --> 56:33.760
 I'm always on Twitter.

56:33.760 --> 56:35.760
 You're always free.

56:35.760 --> 56:37.760
 You're always free.

56:39.760 --> 56:41.760
 I want to open it soon.

56:41.760 --> 56:43.760
 I have this.

56:43.760 --> 56:51.760
 This is the limited edition of the
song.

56:51.760 --> 57:06.760
 This song, DVD, and the making of the
music video of Endless.

57:06.760 --> 57:10.760
 And the booklet.

57:10.760 --> 57:12.760
 I heard that this box is famous.

57:12.760 --> 57:13.760
 Right?

57:13.760 --> 57:15.760
 It's a box!

57:15.760 --> 57:20.760
 I saw it and I thought it was a box.

57:20.760 --> 57:22.760
 I thought it was a box.

57:22.760 --> 57:24.760
 I thought it was a box.

57:25.760 --> 57:27.760
 I'll open it.

57:30.760 --> 57:32.760
 This is a good one.

57:32.760 --> 57:35.760
 You shouldn't spoil it.

57:35.760 --> 57:38.760
 I'll show you the cover.

57:40.760 --> 57:42.760
 No, no, no.

57:42.760 --> 57:44.760
 You shouldn't do that.

57:45.760 --> 57:47.760
 This is the DVD.

57:47.760 --> 57:50.760
 It looks like this.

57:50.760 --> 57:51.760
 It's small.

57:51.760 --> 57:53.760
 It looks like this.

57:54.760 --> 57:56.760
 You should put it here.

57:56.760 --> 57:58.760
 No, no, no.

57:58.760 --> 58:00.760
 You'll get scolded by adults.

58:02.760 --> 58:05.760
 This is the DVD and CD.

58:05.760 --> 58:07.760
 This is a special box.

58:08.760 --> 58:10.760
 Let's see the CD.

58:11.760 --> 58:14.760
 The people who received this will get
the booklet.

58:14.760 --> 58:16.760
 I want to open it.

58:16.760 --> 58:18.760
 There's a sign on it.

58:20.760 --> 58:21.760
 It's amazing.

58:21.760 --> 58:23.760
 You shouldn't show that.

58:23.760 --> 58:25.760
 It's great.

58:25.760 --> 58:27.760
 It's nice.

58:27.760 --> 58:29.760
 It's amazing.

58:29.760 --> 58:32.384
 This is a booklet.

58:32.384 --> 58:34.384
 It's amazing.

58:38.184 --> 58:40.184
 Bath?

58:41.184 --> 58:43.184
 That's too much.

58:45.184 --> 58:47.184
 You are a luxury man.

58:52.184 --> 58:54.184
 You are a luxury man.

58:55.184 --> 58:57.184
 It's a music video.

58:58.184 --> 59:00.184
 I see.

59:00.184 --> 59:02.184
 Bath.

59:02.184 --> 59:04.184
 I'm a man of man.

59:05.184 --> 59:07.184
 I'm a man of man.

59:08.184 --> 59:10.184
 I'm a man of man.

59:10.184 --> 59:12.184
 You are a man of man.

59:13.184 --> 59:15.184
 No one wants to see it.

59:15.184 --> 59:17.184
 I want to see it.

59:17.184 --> 59:19.184
 I'm embarrassed.

59:19.184 --> 59:21.184
 I'm embarrassed.

59:21.184 --> 59:23.184
 It's a broadcast accident.

59:23.184 --> 59:30.184
 Next is the first live of us.

59:30.184 --> 59:32.184
 It's a HANEDA KIKO KIKO version.

59:33.184 --> 59:35.184
 Listen to it.

59:36.184 --> 59:38.184
 It's not a live video.

59:38.184 --> 59:40.184
 Listen to it.

59:40.184 --> 59:42.184
 Please listen to it.

59:42.184 --> 59:44.184
 Is it free?

59:46.184 --> 59:48.184
 Is it okay?

59:48.184 --> 59:50.184
 I'm nervous.

59:50.184 --> 59:52.184
 I'm nervous.

59:52.184 --> 59:54.184
 I'm nervous.

59:55.184 --> 59:57.184
 I'm nervous.

59:57.184 --> 59:59.184
 Please listen to it.

01:00:01.110 --> 01:00:03.110
 I'm going to be scolded.

01:00:05.110 --> 01:00:07.110
 Everyone will want it.

01:00:08.110 --> 01:00:10.110
 This is the last one, the heart-
throbbing version.

01:00:11.110 --> 01:00:18.110
 All 12 songs are recorded naturally.

01:00:19.110 --> 01:00:25.110
 If you listen to all of these songs,
you'll be in the natural zone.

01:00:25.110 --> 01:00:28.110
 It's blue.

01:00:30.110 --> 01:00:34.110
 Please check out all the phones.

01:00:36.110 --> 01:00:41.110
 Now, let's move on to the broadcast
section.

01:00:42.110 --> 01:00:44.110
 It's time for the broadcast section.

01:00:45.110 --> 01:00:47.110
 Let's go to the broadcast section.

01:00:47.110 --> 01:00:55.110
 First, let's broadcast with DiverCity.

01:00:57.110 --> 01:01:01.110
 DiverCity is doing a great job.

01:01:05.110 --> 01:01:10.110
 Let's go to the natural zone.

01:01:10.110 --> 01:01:14.592
 Please look forward to the next
broadcast.

01:01:15.592 --> 01:01:17.592
 Here we go!

01:01:17.592 --> 01:01:19.592
 Super exciting channel

01:01:20.592 --> 01:01:23.592
 All Night Tokimeki Japan

01:01:23.592 --> 01:01:25.592
 It was really the best!

01:01:29.592 --> 01:01:30.592
 It's fun

01:01:31.592 --> 01:01:32.592
 It's a test

01:01:32.592 --> 01:01:34.592
 It seems like we can go to the test

01:01:34.592 --> 01:01:36.592
 This is a test

01:01:37.592 --> 01:01:39.592
 Then let's call

01:01:39.592 --> 01:01:42.592
 Next is RIVENCITY

01:01:44.592 --> 01:01:46.592
 T-shirt

01:01:46.592 --> 01:01:48.592
 Thank you!

01:01:50.104 --> 01:01:52.104
 Good evening!

01:01:55.104 --> 01:01:57.104
 Let's say hello to Suzuki-san.

01:01:57.104 --> 01:01:59.104
 Where should we look?

01:01:59.104 --> 01:02:00.104
 If we look this way?

01:02:00.104 --> 01:02:01.104
 This way.

01:02:01.104 --> 01:02:02.104
 Let's go!

01:02:02.104 --> 01:02:03.104
 To Suzuki-san's heart,

01:02:03.104 --> 01:02:04.104
 Rock on!

01:02:04.104 --> 01:02:06.104
 We are Super Doki Doki Senpai!

01:02:06.104 --> 01:02:09.104
 Thank you!

01:02:10.104 --> 01:02:11.104
 Thank you!

01:02:11.104 --> 01:02:13.104
 Oh, this!

01:02:13.104 --> 01:02:15.104
 There are a lot of people outside.

01:02:15.104 --> 01:02:17.104
 Wow!

01:02:18.272 --> 01:02:20.272
 Where are we now?

01:02:20.272 --> 01:02:22.272
 We are at the store!

01:02:22.272 --> 01:02:22.906
 We are at the store!

01:02:22.906 --> 01:02:24.906
 It's before the store, right?

01:02:24.906 --> 01:02:25.906
 Yes.

01:02:26.906 --> 01:02:27.906
 Thank you.

01:02:27.906 --> 01:02:28.906
 Thank you.

01:02:28.906 --> 01:02:30.906
 Music video is playing.

01:02:30.906 --> 01:02:32.906
 It's so big.

01:02:32.906 --> 01:02:34.906
 It's big.

01:02:34.906 --> 01:02:35.906
 Great.

01:02:35.906 --> 01:02:39.906
 And this cute jacket.

01:02:39.906 --> 01:02:40.906
 I like it.

01:02:40.906 --> 01:02:42.906
 I'm glad.

01:02:43.906 --> 01:02:44.906
 Inside the store?

01:02:44.906 --> 01:02:47.906
 They will show us inside.

01:02:49.906 --> 01:02:50.906
 Great.

01:02:50.906 --> 01:02:51.696
 Awesome.

01:02:51.696 --> 01:02:53.696
 Isn't it amazing?

01:02:57.696 --> 01:02:59.696
 It's hard to see.

01:02:59.696 --> 01:03:00.696
 It's so cute.

01:03:00.696 --> 01:03:01.696
 Look at this.

01:03:05.696 --> 01:03:13.696
 If you buy it at this store, you can
get a special receipt.

01:03:15.696 --> 01:03:17.696
 Please check it out.

01:03:17.696 --> 01:03:19.696
 It's so cute.

01:03:19.696 --> 01:03:21.696
 I'm so happy.

01:03:21.696 --> 01:03:25.696
 I'm glad to see the costume.

01:03:25.696 --> 01:03:27.696
 I'm glad to see the costume.

01:03:27.696 --> 01:03:29.696

 I'll give you this costume.

01:03:33.696 --> 01:03:35.546
 Thank you for your purchase.

01:03:35.546 --> 01:03:36.546
 I heard a lot.

01:03:36.546 --> 01:03:40.546
 By the way, which is your favorite
costume?

01:03:40.546 --> 01:03:42.546
 My favorite...

01:03:42.546 --> 01:03:43.546
 Well...

01:03:43.546 --> 01:03:45.546
 This is a very good one.

01:03:45.546 --> 01:03:48.546
 It's a white costume.

01:03:48.546 --> 01:03:49.546
 Cute.

01:03:49.546 --> 01:03:50.546
 Yes.

01:03:50.546 --> 01:03:53.546
 Thank you for giving us a lot of ideas.

01:04:00.546 --> 01:04:04.624
 Yes, I like this one.

01:04:05.624 --> 01:04:07.624
 It's cool!

01:04:07.624 --> 01:04:09.624
 It's a CD.

01:04:09.624 --> 01:04:12.624
 Wow, it's our CD!

01:04:13.624 --> 01:04:15.624
 I'm so happy!

01:04:15.624 --> 01:04:17.624
 Is this poster random?

01:04:17.624 --> 01:04:22.992
 Can I get a poster of my favorite
singer?

01:04:23.992 --> 01:04:25.992
 The poster is random.

01:04:28.992 --> 01:04:31.992
 We drew the autograph.

01:04:32.992 --> 01:04:34.992
 Thank you for your autograph.

01:04:34.992 --> 01:04:44.992

 Do you have any favorite songs?

01:05:12.248 --> 01:05:13.456
 Do you?

01:05:13.456 --> 01:05:19.456
 I like all of your songs, but I like
the one from July the most.

01:05:20.456 --> 01:05:21.456
 You're popular!

01:05:21.456 --> 01:05:23.456
 I like the one from July the most.

01:05:24.456 --> 01:05:27.456
 I like the choreography, so I hope
you'll watch it.

01:05:27.456 --> 01:05:30.456
 I hope you'll come to our concert
someday.

01:05:30.456 --> 01:05:34.906
 Please come to our concert! We'll be
waiting for you!

01:05:34.906 --> 01:05:36.906
 I'm sorry.

01:05:38.906 --> 01:05:40.906
 Time lapse.

01:05:44.906 --> 01:05:46.906
 I'm a little lonely.

01:05:47.906 --> 01:05:49.906
 Thank you for your continued support.

01:05:50.906 --> 01:05:52.906

01:05:52.906 --> 01:05:54.906

01:05:56.906 --> 01:05:58.906
 One year special show.

01:05:58.906 --> 01:06:02.352
 Thank you.

01:06:03.352 --> 01:06:07.352
 So, do you have any tweets that made
your heart flutter?

01:06:07.352 --> 01:06:08.352
 I'll check it out.

01:06:08.352 --> 01:06:10.352
 I saw a good one.

01:06:10.352 --> 01:06:14.352
 The husband is washing the dishes.

01:06:17.352 --> 01:06:22.352
 Husband, please wash the dishes for
your wife.

01:06:24.352 --> 01:06:27.352
 The world will be filled with
excitement.

01:06:27.352 --> 01:06:28.352
 Let's do it.

01:06:28.352 --> 01:06:29.352
 Let's make it peaceful.

01:06:29.352 --> 01:06:31.352
 Please wash the dishes.

01:06:33.352 --> 01:06:35.352
 It's Christmas.

01:06:35.352 --> 01:06:37.352
 Let's fight.

01:06:40.352 --> 01:06:41.352
 Do you have any tweets?

01:06:42.352 --> 01:06:43.352
 Meat.

01:06:43.352 --> 01:06:44.352
 Steak.

01:06:44.352 --> 01:06:46.352
 That's what makes my heart flutter.

01:06:46.352 --> 01:06:47.352
 Steak.

01:06:47.352 --> 01:06:48.352
 It's a video.

01:06:51.352 --> 01:06:52.352
 I'm waiting for it.

01:06:53.352 --> 01:06:55.352
 She said, I wash the dishes every day.

01:06:55.352 --> 01:06:57.352
 That's kind of you.

01:06:57.352 --> 01:06:59.352
 I'm excited.

01:06:59.352 --> 01:07:01.352
 I went to Ura-Oten.

01:07:01.352 --> 01:07:03.352
 Thank you.

01:07:04.464 --> 01:07:06.464
 It's a Tenbo by Yamiyoshi.

01:07:06.464 --> 01:07:08.464
 Thank you.

01:07:10.464 --> 01:07:12.464
 I got a message!

01:07:18.464 --> 01:07:22.464
 I'm a boyfriend who has been dating
since I was a student.

01:07:22.464 --> 01:07:24.464
 I'm going to propose to you.

01:07:24.464 --> 01:07:32.464
 Congratulations!

01:07:32.752 --> 01:07:33.752

01:07:35.696 --> 01:07:37.696
 Congratulations!

01:07:37.696 --> 01:07:39.696
 What is this?

01:07:39.696 --> 01:07:41.696
 I can't stop clapping.

01:07:45.696 --> 01:07:49.696
 I want to have a surprise wedding with
the PR staff someday.

01:07:49.696 --> 01:07:51.696
 I want to have a surprise wedding.

01:07:51.696 --> 01:07:53.696
 I want to go to the wedding.

01:07:53.696 --> 01:07:59.696
 I want to change the name of our

 I want to change the name of our
company.

01:08:01.696 --> 01:08:05.696
 I want to change the name of our
company.

01:08:05.696 --> 01:08:07.696
 It's interesting.

01:08:07.696 --> 01:08:09.696
 Hiyori is interesting today.

01:08:09.696 --> 01:08:11.696
 She is always interesting.

01:08:11.696 --> 01:08:13.696
 She is the best today.

01:08:15.696 --> 01:08:17.696
 Everyone is saying congratulations.

01:08:17.696 --> 01:08:18.696
 She is kind.

01:08:18.696 --> 01:08:20.696
 She is washing the bath.

01:08:20.696 --> 01:08:22.696
 She is very kind.

01:08:24.696 --> 01:08:26.696
 I want you to say that you are warm.

01:08:26.696 --> 01:08:28.696
 It's good.

01:08:28.696 --> 01:08:31.696
 It says that she made a new person.

01:08:33.696 --> 01:08:35.696
 I want to have another person.

01:08:35.696 --> 01:08:37.696
 I see.

01:08:37.696 --> 01:08:39.696
 Another person?

01:08:39.696 --> 01:08:41.696
 Another person?

01:08:41.696 --> 01:08:43.696
 Another person?

01:08:43.696 --> 01:08:45.696
 Another person?

01:08:45.696 --> 01:08:47.696
 It's her.

01:08:47.696 --> 01:08:49.696
 It's her.

01:08:49.696 --> 01:08:57.696
 She is doing her best in front of
Shibuya.

01:08:57.696 --> 01:09:01.696
 She is our official character.

01:09:01.696 --> 01:09:05.696
 She is doing her best.

01:09:05.696 --> 01:09:09.696
 She is doing her best for the special
event.

01:09:09.696 --> 01:09:12.696
 She is OPAV.

01:09:12.696 --> 01:09:15.696
 She is waiting for you.

01:09:15.696 --> 01:09:20.696
 She is waiting for you.

01:09:20.696 --> 01:09:22.696
 What is she holding?

01:09:22.696 --> 01:09:26.696
 What is she holding?

01:09:26.696 --> 01:09:28.696
 What is it?

01:09:28.696 --> 01:09:30.696
 It's Starbucks.

01:09:30.696 --> 01:09:32.696
 Starbucks?

01:09:32.696 --> 01:09:34.696
 It's a waiting time.

01:09:34.696 --> 01:09:36.696
 That's right.

01:09:36.696 --> 01:09:38.696
 That's right.

01:09:38.696 --> 01:09:40.696
 It's the waiting time.

01:09:40.696 --> 01:09:43.696
 There is a Cinderella time.

01:09:43.696 --> 01:09:45.696
 It's until 8pm.

01:09:45.696 --> 01:09:47.696
 It's a break time.

01:09:47.696 --> 01:09:50.696
 You can still make it in time.

01:09:50.696 --> 01:09:52.696
 Please come and see us.

01:09:52.696 --> 01:09:54.696
 Please come.

01:09:54.696 --> 01:09:56.696
 The pillars are amazing.

01:09:56.696 --> 01:09:58.696
 Please come.

01:09:58.696 --> 01:10:00.696
 It's reproduced.

01:10:00.696 --> 01:10:02.696
 It looks like it's going to be hard.

01:10:02.696 --> 01:10:04.696
 It's dangerous.

01:10:04.696 --> 01:10:06.696
 It's dangerous.

01:10:06.696 --> 01:10:08.696
 It's a bit scary.

01:10:08.696 --> 01:10:10.696
 She is breathing.

01:10:10.696 --> 01:10:13.696
 The pillars are amazing.

01:10:13.696 --> 01:10:15.696
 It's a bit scary.

01:10:15.696 --> 01:10:17.696
 It's a bit scary.

01:10:17.696 --> 01:10:19.696
 It's okay.

01:10:19.696 --> 01:10:21.696
 You can go back to your normal
position.

01:10:21.696 --> 01:10:23.696
 What is it?

01:10:23.696 --> 01:10:25.696
 What is it?

01:10:25.696 --> 01:10:27.696
 It's cute.

01:10:27.696 --> 01:10:29.696
 It's cute.

01:10:29.696 --> 01:10:31.696
 It's cute.

01:10:31.696 --> 01:10:33.344
 It's warm.

01:10:34.344 --> 01:10:37.344
 You've been doing it for a long time.

01:10:37.344 --> 01:10:40.344
 Someone has to say it.

01:10:40.344 --> 01:10:43.344
 Show me the pillar.

01:10:43.344 --> 01:10:45.344
 Show me the pillar.

01:10:45.344 --> 01:10:48.344
 It's the 26th.

01:10:48.344 --> 01:10:50.344
 It's the day of the big event.

01:10:50.344 --> 01:10:52.344
 Thank you for the announcement.

01:10:52.344 --> 01:10:54.344
 You want to see the pillar, right?

01:10:54.344 --> 01:10:56.344
 Is there a pillar?

01:10:56.344 --> 01:10:58.344
 Show me the pillar.

01:10:58.344 --> 01:11:00.344
 Can you turn right a little more?

01:11:00.344 --> 01:11:03.344
 This posture is quite warm.

01:11:06.416 --> 01:11:08.416
 I'm sleepy.

01:11:08.416 --> 01:11:09.416
 Paburi!

01:11:09.416 --> 01:11:11.416
 Paburi, do your best until the end!

01:11:11.416 --> 01:11:13.416

01:11:17.416 --> 01:11:19.416
 December 20th?

01:11:21.416 --> 01:11:26.416
 If you can make it to the 20th, please
meet up with Paburi!

01:11:26.416 --> 01:11:28.416
 Please take a picture!

01:11:28.416 --> 01:11:34.416
 Now, we'd like to do a project here.

01:11:34.416 --> 01:11:39.416

 What cake will Julia eat this
Christmas?

01:12:55.536 --> 01:12:57.536
 This is a cake.

01:12:57.536 --> 01:12:59.536
 This is a woman eating a cake.

01:13:01.536 --> 01:13:03.536
 This is a twin tail.

01:13:07.536 --> 01:13:09.536
 Next, Hitoka.

01:13:09.536 --> 01:13:15.536
 What do I prepare for Christmas?

01:13:15.536 --> 01:13:17.536
 That's the question.

01:13:17.536 --> 01:13:21.536
 Can you tell us the name of the member?

01:13:21.536 --> 01:13:23.536
 It's easy to understand.

01:13:23.536 --> 01:13:25.536
 My quiz is...

01:13:25.536 --> 01:13:31.536
 I eat paella at home every Christmas.

01:13:31.536 --> 01:13:35.536
 Which country's food is paella?

01:13:35.536 --> 01:13:37.536
 Please write the country's name.

01:13:37.536 --> 01:13:39.536
 This is a good question.

01:13:41.536 --> 01:13:43.536
 Let's move on.

01:13:43.536 --> 01:13:45.536
 Next, I'll answer.

01:13:45.536 --> 01:13:53.536
 What color was the macaron on the
Christmas cake last year?

01:13:53.536 --> 01:13:55.536
 What color was it?

01:13:55.536 --> 01:13:57.536
 It's difficult.

01:13:57.536 --> 01:14:03.536
 My birthday cake was a cheesecake tart.

01:14:03.536 --> 01:14:07.536
 It was a cheesecake tart cake with a
macaron on top.

01:14:07.536 --> 01:14:11.536
 This year, it was orange, yellow and
white.

01:14:11.536 --> 01:14:15.536
 What color was the Christmas cake last
year?

01:14:15.536 --> 01:14:17.536

01:14:17.536 --> 01:14:19.536
 Next, Hiori's quiz.

 This is Hiori's quiz.

01:14:23.536 --> 01:14:33.536
 What was the present that Hiori asked
Santa Claus for his childhood?

01:14:35.536 --> 01:14:37.536
 What do you think it is?

01:14:37.536 --> 01:14:39.536
 It's a present I asked for when I was a
kid.

01:14:39.536 --> 01:14:41.536
 How old was I?

01:14:41.536 --> 01:14:43.536
 I think I was three years old.

01:14:43.536 --> 01:14:45.536
 I see.

01:14:47.536 --> 01:14:49.536
 I got a hint.

01:14:49.536 --> 01:14:51.536
 What is it?

01:14:51.536 --> 01:14:53.536
 What is it?

01:14:53.536 --> 01:14:55.536
 It's a hint.

01:14:55.536 --> 01:14:57.536
 It's scary.

01:14:57.536 --> 01:14:59.536
 It's a hint.

01:14:59.536 --> 01:15:01.536
 It's okay.

01:15:01.536 --> 01:15:03.536
 Please do your best.

01:15:03.536 --> 01:15:05.536
 Let's read the questions one by one.

01:15:05.536 --> 01:15:10.592
 I'm going to read the question.

01:15:11.592 --> 01:15:13.592
 What day is it in the lunar calendar?

01:15:14.592 --> 01:15:18.592
 What cake are you going to eat this
Christmas?

01:15:19.592 --> 01:15:23.592
 What do I prepare for Santa every year?

01:15:27.592 --> 01:15:31.592
 I eat paella at home every Christmas.

01:15:32.592 --> 01:15:34.592
 Which country's food is paella?

01:15:34.592 --> 01:15:36.592
 I know this one.

01:15:37.592 --> 01:15:39.592
 I don't know.

01:15:40.592 --> 01:15:42.592
 I just want to know.

01:15:42.592 --> 01:15:50.592
 I'm going to eat the macaron which was
on the cake last year.

01:15:51.200 --> 01:15:58.200
 What is the Christmas present that
Hiori asked Santa Claus for?

01:15:58.200 --> 01:16:09.200
 Please write down your answer, name of
the member and the answer.

01:16:09.200 --> 01:16:12.200
 You will get a hand bell.

01:16:12.200 --> 01:16:15.200
 We will sign it.

01:16:15.200 --> 01:16:20.200
 Please sign it.

01:16:20.200 --> 01:16:23.200
 I got a purple macaron.

01:16:23.200 --> 01:16:24.200
 How is it?

01:16:24.200 --> 01:16:26.200
 I'm sorry.

01:16:26.200 --> 01:16:29.200
 Tio got a Pikachu doll.

01:16:29.200 --> 01:16:30.200
 That's close.

01:16:30.200 --> 01:16:32.200
 That's the answer.

01:16:32.200 --> 01:16:33.200
 That's close.

01:16:33.200 --> 01:16:35.200
 Purple macaron looks delicious.

01:16:35.200 --> 01:16:37.200
 Pink?

01:16:37.200 --> 01:16:41.200

01:16:43.400 --> 01:16:46.400
 I thought it was Keroro.

01:16:46.400 --> 01:16:49.400
 I thought it was Keroro.

01:16:51.400 --> 01:16:53.400
 Tadurin?

01:16:56.400 --> 01:16:59.400
 I will ask Tadurin to be a guest.

01:17:01.400 --> 01:17:03.400
 She is not here today.

01:17:03.400 --> 01:17:05.400
 She will be here.

01:17:05.400 --> 01:17:07.400
 Tadurin!

01:17:07.400 --> 01:17:09.400

01:17:29.400 --> 01:17:31.400
 Hello!

01:17:33.096 --> 01:17:35.096
 It's the last song!

01:17:36.096 --> 01:17:38.096
 Let's do a greeting to Ida-san.

01:17:39.096 --> 01:17:40.096
 I don't know what to do.

01:17:41.096 --> 01:17:43.096
 Let's do it. I'm sure you can feel it.

01:17:44.096 --> 01:17:45.096
 Ready, go!

01:17:45.096 --> 01:17:47.096

01:18:04.896 --> 01:18:06.896
 Everyone!

01:18:06.896 --> 01:18:08.896
 I wonder if there is a little...

01:18:08.896 --> 01:18:10.896
 There is a little noise.

01:18:10.896 --> 01:18:12.896
 I want to tell you with Tablin
telepathy.

01:18:12.896 --> 01:18:14.896

01:18:20.896 --> 01:18:22.896
 Yes.

01:18:22.896 --> 01:18:24.896
 I'm kidding.

01:18:24.896 --> 01:18:26.896
 Bye-bye!

01:18:54.896 --> 01:18:56.896
 Let's eat cake together!

01:18:56.896 --> 01:18:58.896
 Let's eat cake together!

01:18:58.896 --> 01:19:00.896
 You?

01:19:00.896 --> 01:19:02.896
 You?

01:19:02.896 --> 01:19:04.896
 I was looking forward to it.

01:19:04.896 --> 01:19:06.896
 I was looking forward to it.

01:19:06.896 --> 01:19:08.896
 This is next.

01:19:08.896 --> 01:19:10.896
 Next?

01:19:10.896 --> 01:19:12.896
 I'm looking forward to the cake.

01:19:12.896 --> 01:19:14.896
 I'm looking forward to the cake.

01:19:14.896 --> 01:19:16.896
 I'm looking forward to it.

01:19:16.896 --> 01:19:18.896
 I want to eat it.

01:19:18.896 --> 01:19:20.896
 Let's eat cake!

01:19:20.896 --> 01:19:22.896
 Cake!

01:19:22.896 --> 01:19:24.896
 I wonder if the answer is coming.

01:19:24.896 --> 01:19:26.896
 I've been waiting for a cake.

01:19:26.896 --> 01:19:28.896
 I wonder if the answer is coming.

01:19:28.896 --> 01:19:31.632
 I've been waiting for a cake.

01:19:32.632 --> 01:19:36.632
 I want a hand mirror that can be
signed.

01:19:36.632 --> 01:19:38.632
 I wonder if it's possible to sign it
like this.

01:19:39.632 --> 01:19:41.632
 Hito-chan, cookie.

01:19:45.632 --> 01:19:47.632
 Aki-chan, green.

01:19:49.632 --> 01:19:51.632
 Aki-chan is also quite difficult.

01:19:51.632 --> 01:19:57.632
 I'm looking forward to it. Cake, cake.

01:20:00.952 --> 01:20:02.952
 I wanted to eat spring cake.

01:20:03.952 --> 01:20:07.952
 Before eating cake, let's drink
alcohol.

01:20:08.952 --> 01:20:09.952
 Let's go.

01:20:12.952 --> 01:20:13.952
 Cake.

01:20:13.952 --> 01:20:14.952
 It's a cake.

01:20:21.978 --> 01:20:24.978
 Do you wear a belt?

01:20:24.978 --> 01:20:27.978
 Yes, I do.

01:20:35.770 --> 01:20:37.770
 I'll put it here.

01:20:39.770 --> 01:20:41.770
 The skirt is too big.

01:20:46.770 --> 01:20:47.770
 Thank you.

01:20:47.770 --> 01:20:49.770
 Staff is the priority.

01:20:53.770 --> 01:20:55.770
 Staff is the priority.

01:20:55.770 --> 01:20:57.770
 Not member.

01:20:57.770 --> 01:20:59.770
 Thank you.

01:21:10.746 --> 01:21:12.746
 Here you go.

01:21:14.746 --> 01:21:16.746
 Aki-chan.

01:21:21.746 --> 01:21:22.746
 This is great.

01:21:22.746 --> 01:21:24.746
 You have 4 members.

01:21:32.954 --> 01:21:37.954
 If you have a cake, please prepare it.

01:21:37.954 --> 01:21:39.954
 I don't know if there is a cake.

01:21:41.954 --> 01:21:43.954
 I eat a lot of cake recently.

01:21:44.954 --> 01:21:45.954
 With Aki-chan.

01:21:45.954 --> 01:21:48.320
 Please subscribe to my channel.

01:21:49.320 --> 01:21:51.320
 Let's take a picture together.

01:21:52.320 --> 01:21:54.320
 Look at this side.

01:21:55.320 --> 01:21:56.320
 Cute.

01:21:56.320 --> 01:21:59.320
 I like it. Thank you.

01:22:08.320 --> 01:22:10.320
 I'll have a cake.

01:22:10.320 --> 01:22:19.320
 I'm glad. Thank you.

01:22:20.818 --> 01:22:22.858
 Everyone!

01:22:22.978 --> 01:22:24.618
 Itadakimasu!

01:22:25.918 --> 01:22:26.918
 Bon Appetit!

01:22:27.078 --> 01:22:29.098
 R Quèr X Kahler

01:22:29.098 --> 01:22:31.358
 Took the AirPods chasing us

01:22:34.078 --> 01:22:36.118
 Now, we have AirPods

01:22:37.198 --> 01:22:37.898
 Let's go,

01:22:38.838 --> 01:22:39.296
 The footsteps we've heard

01:22:39.296 --> 01:22:44.296
 It's the moment when you eat it.

01:22:44.296 --> 01:22:46.296
 When we eat, nothing is interesting.

01:22:46.296 --> 01:22:49.296
 Let's be careful.

01:22:49.296 --> 01:22:53.296
 Let's eat.

01:22:53.296 --> 01:22:57.296
 It's great.

01:22:57.296 --> 01:23:03.296
 It's delicious.

01:23:05.256 --> 01:23:06.256
 Wow, it's hot.

01:23:06.256 --> 01:23:08.256
 It's a special way to roll it.

01:23:08.256 --> 01:23:09.256
 Are you OK?

01:23:09.256 --> 01:23:10.256
 I'm OK.

01:23:12.256 --> 01:23:13.256
 I'll eat it.

01:23:13.256 --> 01:23:15.256
 Do you want to eat this?

01:23:21.256 --> 01:23:24.256
 Julia, please look at the camera for
the sake of spring.

01:23:24.256 --> 01:23:25.256
 Talk to me.

01:23:26.256 --> 01:23:28.256
 For the sake of spring.

01:23:28.256 --> 01:23:32.752
 I'm not eating the rice gruel. I'm
eating the spring roll.

01:23:33.752 --> 01:23:35.752
 She's looking at the camera.

01:23:36.752 --> 01:23:37.752
 How is it?

01:23:38.752 --> 01:23:39.752
 Thank you!

01:23:40.752 --> 01:23:41.752
 I'm Yukako.

01:23:45.752 --> 01:23:47.752
 Can I have some of Akita's sweet red
bean?

01:23:47.752 --> 01:24:00.368
 Please subscribe to our channel.

01:24:01.368 --> 01:24:02.368
 Cute.

01:24:02.368 --> 01:24:04.368
 It's dangerous.

01:24:05.368 --> 01:24:06.368
 Strawberry is the best.

01:24:07.368 --> 01:24:09.368
 The last one was a cake?

01:24:09.368 --> 01:24:11.368
 I love you.

01:24:14.200 --> 01:24:16.200
 We are in the same age.

01:24:20.200 --> 01:24:22.200
 Don't wait for the switching.

01:24:24.200 --> 01:24:27.200
 Do you want to eat strawberry?

01:24:27.200 --> 01:24:29.200
 The back is noisy.

01:24:29.200 --> 01:24:32.200
 I won't give you.

01:24:32.200 --> 01:24:37.200
 Cute.

01:24:37.392 --> 01:24:39.392
 I'm a little embarrassed.

01:24:43.392 --> 01:24:45.392
 It's delicious.

01:24:46.392 --> 01:24:48.392
 I wonder if anyone has a cake at home.

01:24:48.392 --> 01:24:49.392
 That's right.

01:24:49.392 --> 01:24:50.392
 It's amazing.

01:24:50.392 --> 01:24:53.392
 I wonder if anyone has a birthday on
Christmas.

01:24:53.392 --> 01:24:55.392
 I think so.

01:24:55.392 --> 01:24:57.392
 I want to be announced to the north.

01:24:57.392 --> 01:24:59.392
 I want to be announced to the south.

01:25:02.248 --> 01:25:05.248
 I'm eating it, but it's okay.

01:25:06.248 --> 01:25:07.248
 I want to eat it.

01:25:07.248 --> 01:25:08.248
 Do you want it?

01:25:14.768 --> 01:25:16.768
 Cute!

01:25:16.768 --> 01:25:18.768
 I think it's dangerous.

01:25:18.768 --> 01:25:20.768
 If you put on a costume, it's like a
short cut.

01:25:20.768 --> 01:25:22.768
 That's true.

01:25:22.768 --> 01:25:24.768
 I want to go to the short cut.

01:25:26.768 --> 01:25:28.768
 Hiyorin, you're cute.

01:25:30.768 --> 01:25:32.768
 Let's go to Kaname.

01:25:32.768 --> 01:25:34.768
 I'm waiting for you.

01:25:34.768 --> 01:25:36.768
 Let's go to Kaname.

01:25:36.768 --> 01:25:38.768
 The bird is weird.

01:25:38.768 --> 01:25:44.250
 Why?

01:25:44.250 --> 01:25:47.570
 Chickens Abby&Elena

01:25:51.072 --> 01:25:54.072
 So, we did it in 5 people.

01:25:54.072 --> 01:25:56.072
 So, Koizumi-san will be the last one.

01:25:56.072 --> 01:25:57.072
 Why?

01:25:57.072 --> 01:25:59.072
 Everyone, you have to decide.

01:25:59.072 --> 01:26:01.072
 Everyone is waiting.

01:26:03.072 --> 01:26:05.072
 Why?

01:26:05.072 --> 01:26:06.072
 Haruka-chan!

01:26:07.072 --> 01:26:08.072
 This is weird.

01:26:08.072 --> 01:26:10.072
 Really weird.

01:26:14.072 --> 01:26:15.072
 Why?

01:26:15.072 --> 01:26:16.072
 I'm not going to do it.

01:26:16.072 --> 01:26:21.072
 Why? I really hate it.

01:26:21.072 --> 01:26:25.072
 I almost ate the strawberry.

01:26:25.072 --> 01:26:27.072
 I'm going to put the strawberry on it.

01:26:27.072 --> 01:26:30.256
 I'm going to put it on.

01:26:31.256 --> 01:26:33.256
 Well, then...

01:26:33.256 --> 01:26:35.256
 Are you serious?

01:26:35.256 --> 01:26:36.256
 Until you get it.

01:26:36.256 --> 01:26:39.256
 3, 2, 1, go!

01:26:39.256 --> 01:26:47.256
 Do you want it?

01:26:47.450 --> 01:26:49.450
 I'm happy.

01:26:49.450 --> 01:26:51.450
 I'm happy.

01:26:51.450 --> 01:26:53.450
 OK, that's all.

01:26:55.450 --> 01:26:57.450
 You just said, Hana.

01:26:57.450 --> 01:26:59.450
 I'm sorry.

01:27:01.450 --> 01:27:03.450
 It's long.

01:27:03.450 --> 01:27:05.450
 It was the best.

01:27:05.450 --> 01:27:07.450
 It's long.

01:27:07.450 --> 01:27:09.450
 No, no, no.

01:27:12.704 --> 01:27:14.704
 Show us the result of your practice.

01:27:14.704 --> 01:27:16.704
 I didn't practice anything.

01:27:16.704 --> 01:27:18.704
 Let's do it together.

01:27:18.704 --> 01:27:20.704
 Ready, go.

01:27:20.704 --> 01:27:22.704
 Ready, go.

01:27:22.704 --> 01:27:24.704
 OK.

01:27:24.704 --> 01:27:26.272
지고ova

01:27:26.632 --> 01:27:28.472
 The hood of that bandit who asked for
reliable decree

01:27:35.832 --> 01:27:37.552
 The cake is falling

01:27:40.012 --> 01:27:41.552
 the lemon

01:27:46.152 --> 01:27:47.552
 Took the candy

01:27:47.552 --> 01:27:49.552
 Haruka, I love you!

01:27:53.056 --> 01:27:55.056
 Thank you.

01:28:09.722 --> 01:28:11.722
 The cake is delicious.

01:28:11.722 --> 01:28:12.722
 Yes.

01:28:12.722 --> 01:28:13.722
 Delicious.

01:28:14.722 --> 01:28:16.722
 I can't stop eating it.

01:28:16.722 --> 01:28:18.722
 Tomorrow is Eve.

01:28:19.722 --> 01:28:21.722
 I bought a cheesecake.

01:28:21.722 --> 01:28:22.722
 I ate it today.

01:28:23.722 --> 01:28:24.722
 Really?

01:28:24.722 --> 01:28:25.722
 I ate it little by little.

01:28:27.722 --> 01:28:30.722
 I want to do a cake one-hole challenge.

01:28:34.722 --> 01:28:35.722
 Delicious.

01:28:35.722 --> 01:28:37.722
 Delicious.

01:28:38.728 --> 01:28:39.728
 Amazing.

01:28:40.728 --> 01:28:42.728
 Do you eat strawberry first?

01:28:42.728 --> 01:28:44.728
 I eat strawberry last.

01:28:44.728 --> 01:28:45.728
 I know.

01:28:45.728 --> 01:28:46.728
 I know.

01:28:48.728 --> 01:28:52.728
 I feel fresh when I eat strawberry
last.

01:28:53.728 --> 01:28:54.728
 I eat strawberry together.

01:28:54.728 --> 01:29:03.728
 I eat strawberry together.

01:29:04.506 --> 01:29:05.506
 Strawberry?

01:29:05.506 --> 01:29:07.506
 1, 2, 5, strawberry.

01:29:07.506 --> 01:29:08.506
 I know this!

01:29:08.506 --> 01:29:09.506
 I know this!

01:29:09.506 --> 01:29:10.506
 It's nostalgic.

01:29:10.506 --> 01:29:11.506
 Eh?

01:29:11.506 --> 01:29:12.506
 It's okay.

01:29:12.506 --> 01:29:13.506
 Stand in front of the camera.

01:29:13.506 --> 01:29:14.506
 Wait a minute.

01:29:14.506 --> 01:29:15.506
 Okay.

01:29:18.506 --> 01:29:20.506
 Thank you for the meal.

01:29:20.506 --> 01:29:21.506
 That was fast.

01:29:22.506 --> 01:29:24.506
 Hito-chan's strawberry song.

01:29:24.506 --> 01:29:26.506
 Please listen to it.

01:29:26.506 --> 01:29:28.736
 Strawberry song.

01:29:29.736 --> 01:29:30.736
 I think it's a bit too much.

01:29:30.736 --> 01:29:34.736
 Strawberry, strawberry, strawberry,
strawberry, how about one?

01:29:34.736 --> 01:29:37.736
 Thank you for the meal.

01:29:38.736 --> 01:29:39.736
 Cute.

01:29:39.736 --> 01:29:41.736
 The song is gone.

01:29:42.736 --> 01:29:43.736
 Thank you.

01:29:43.736 --> 01:29:44.736
 When is the next live?

01:29:44.736 --> 01:30:00.736
 This is... strawberry, strawberry,
strawberry, strawberry, well, 2,150
people are watching.

01:30:01.736 --> 01:30:03.736
 January 5th.

01:30:04.736 --> 01:30:05.736
 It's my birthday.

01:30:05.736 --> 01:30:06.736
 I'm telling you.

01:30:06.736 --> 01:30:08.736
 January 15th is also my birthday.

01:30:08.736 --> 01:30:09.736
 January 15th.

01:30:09.736 --> 01:30:10.736
 Oh, yeah.

01:30:10.736 --> 01:30:11.736
 It's my junior's birthday.

01:30:11.736 --> 01:30:13.736
 January 15th.

01:30:13.736 --> 01:30:15.736
 Why am I being taken?

01:30:15.736 --> 01:30:19.736
 It's scheduled to be released in two
days.

01:30:20.736 --> 01:30:22.736
 You gave us a quiz earlier.

01:30:22.736 --> 01:30:24.736
 Give us a hint.

01:30:24.736 --> 01:30:26.736
 Hint? Do I have a hint?

01:30:28.736 --> 01:30:29.736
 I don't know.

01:30:31.736 --> 01:30:34.736
 Thank you for the meal.

01:30:34.736 --> 01:30:36.736
 What kind of hint do you like?

01:30:36.736 --> 01:30:37.736
 1

01:30:39.864 --> 01:30:40.864
 One!

01:30:41.864 --> 01:30:43.864
 One is a hint?

01:30:44.864 --> 01:30:49.864
 The hint is that it's a day that
everyone is looking forward to.

01:30:50.864 --> 01:30:51.864
 Thank you.

01:30:51.864 --> 01:30:54.864
 It's a question related to Christmas.

01:30:54.864 --> 01:30:56.864
 It's almost there.

01:30:58.864 --> 01:31:01.864
 Everyone is answering correctly on
Twitter.

01:31:03.864 --> 01:31:05.864
 What about you, Juri?

01:31:05.864 --> 01:31:07.864
 My hint is...

01:31:08.864 --> 01:31:11.864
 I think it's something I like.

01:31:11.864 --> 01:31:12.864
 That's right.

01:31:13.864 --> 01:31:15.864
 I ate it last year.

01:31:16.864 --> 01:31:17.864
 That's all.

01:31:17.864 --> 01:31:19.864
 There's no one who said that.

01:31:19.864 --> 01:31:22.864
 If I say this, everyone will know.

01:31:23.864 --> 01:31:25.864
 What about Hitoka?

01:31:25.864 --> 01:31:27.864
 I have two.

01:31:30.776 --> 01:31:32.776
 I have two.

01:31:34.776 --> 01:31:36.776
 I will say one.

01:31:36.776 --> 01:31:37.776
 I don't want to say.

01:31:38.776 --> 01:31:39.776
 What should I do?

01:31:39.776 --> 01:31:40.776
 Secret?

01:31:42.776 --> 01:31:43.776
 Secret.

01:31:43.776 --> 01:31:45.776
 I will say that I have two.

01:31:45.776 --> 01:31:49.776
 If you tweet me two, it's correct.

01:31:49.776 --> 01:31:52.776
 Not one, but two.

01:31:55.008 --> 01:31:57.008
 Is this a hint for the impromptu quiz?

01:31:57.008 --> 01:31:58.008
 Yes.

01:31:59.008 --> 01:32:02.008
 My hint is yellow.

01:32:02.008 --> 01:32:05.008
 I thought it was Twitter.

01:32:06.008 --> 01:32:07.008
 Yellow.

01:32:07.008 --> 01:32:08.008
 Yellow.

01:32:09.008 --> 01:32:10.008
 Yellow.

01:32:10.008 --> 01:32:11.008
 Yellow.

01:32:13.008 --> 01:32:14.008
 I think I got it.

01:32:15.008 --> 01:32:16.008
 Yellow and red.

01:32:16.008 --> 01:32:17.008
 Yellow is good.

01:32:18.008 --> 01:32:19.008
 I got it.

01:32:19.008 --> 01:32:20.008
 Yes.

01:32:20.008 --> 01:32:24.008
 What is my color?

01:32:24.272 --> 01:32:26.272
 Oh, I see.

01:32:27.272 --> 01:32:29.272
 I can't tell you the color.

01:32:29.272 --> 01:32:30.272
 Oh!

01:32:31.272 --> 01:32:32.272
 Oh!

01:32:32.272 --> 01:32:34.272
 I can't tell you the color.

01:32:35.272 --> 01:32:36.272
 I don't know.

01:32:37.272 --> 01:32:38.272
 I don't know.

01:32:38.272 --> 01:32:39.272
 I don't know.

01:32:42.272 --> 01:32:43.272
 Hiyori-san!

01:32:44.272 --> 01:32:45.272
 I really don't know.

01:32:45.272 --> 01:32:58.272
 Hiyori's hint for a small doll is that
hint and the name starts with PO.

01:32:59.272 --> 01:33:00.272
 I told you!

01:33:02.272 --> 01:33:04.272
 The name starts with PO.

01:33:05.272 --> 01:33:07.272
 It's a small doll.

01:33:07.272 --> 01:33:13.272
 Let's call Paburi again.

01:33:14.272 --> 01:33:15.272
 Paburi!

01:33:16.272 --> 01:33:17.272
 Paburi!

01:33:18.272 --> 01:33:19.272
 Paburi!

01:33:19.272 --> 01:33:20.272
 Paburi!

01:33:21.272 --> 01:33:22.272
 Paburi!

01:33:22.272 --> 01:33:23.272
 Paburi!

01:33:23.272 --> 01:33:25.272
 Can you hear me?

01:33:25.272 --> 01:33:27.728
 Bye!

01:33:27.728 --> 01:33:29.728
 Good evening!

01:33:30.728 --> 01:33:32.728
 Good evening!

01:33:32.728 --> 01:33:34.728
 Good evening!

01:33:37.728 --> 01:33:39.728
 Everyone!

01:33:39.728 --> 01:33:41.728
 Hello! Good evening!

01:33:41.728 --> 01:33:47.728
 Thank you!

01:33:47.792 --> 01:33:51.792
 Let's talk a little more.

01:33:51.792 --> 01:33:53.792
 It's already cut off.

01:33:53.792 --> 01:33:55.792
 It's cut off.

01:33:55.792 --> 01:33:57.792
 It's quite difficult.

01:33:57.792 --> 01:33:59.792
 It's a live broadcast.

01:33:59.792 --> 01:34:03.792
 We will greet Iida-san properly
someday.

01:34:03.792 --> 01:34:06.792
 Maybe there is still a chance until 8
o'clock.

01:34:06.792 --> 01:34:08.792
 The last 15 minutes of the time limit.

01:34:08.792 --> 01:34:11.792
 We are the first to enter.

01:34:11.792 --> 01:34:14.792
 We are the second.

01:34:14.792 --> 01:34:16.792
 I'm looking forward to it.

01:34:16.792 --> 01:34:19.792
 This is a present.

01:34:21.792 --> 01:34:23.792
 I've been waiting for this.

01:34:23.792 --> 01:34:25.792
 I've been waiting for this.

01:34:25.792 --> 01:34:27.792
 I've been waiting for this.

01:34:28.792 --> 01:34:32.792
 It's a very special day.

01:34:32.792 --> 01:34:37.792
 We bought Christmas presents within the
time limit.

01:34:37.792 --> 01:34:41.792
 We haven't seen the contents yet.

01:34:41.792 --> 01:34:43.792
 What is this?

01:34:43.792 --> 01:34:46.792
 Let's shuffle.

01:34:46.792 --> 01:34:48.792
 Is it okay to take it off?

01:34:49.792 --> 01:34:52.792
 Let's go to the last minute.

01:34:52.792 --> 01:34:54.792
 What kind of feeling is good?

01:34:54.792 --> 01:34:58.528
 Please come inside.

01:34:59.528 --> 01:35:01.528
 How should I draw?

01:35:02.528 --> 01:35:03.528
 Can you do it?

01:35:03.528 --> 01:35:04.528
 Yes.

01:35:04.528 --> 01:35:05.528
 I'll draw it randomly.

01:35:05.528 --> 01:35:07.528
 Kuro will draw it too.

01:35:07.528 --> 01:35:09.528
 I heard that you can see the inside of
the dress.

01:35:09.528 --> 01:35:14.528
 So, I'll draw it according to the song.

01:35:14.528 --> 01:35:19.600
 Then, I'll draw it according to the
song.

01:35:20.600 --> 01:35:22.600
 Staff will give you a signal.

01:35:23.600 --> 01:35:25.600
 Staff will give you a signal.

01:35:26.600 --> 01:35:27.600
 Let's start.

01:35:33.600 --> 01:35:35.600
 Let's do the opposite side.

01:35:36.600 --> 01:35:38.600
 Let's do it slowly.

01:35:38.600 --> 01:35:40.600
 It's a victory story.

01:35:43.600 --> 01:35:44.600
 It's heavy.

01:35:44.600 --> 01:35:46.600
 It's light.

01:35:48.600 --> 01:35:49.600
 It's light.

01:35:49.600 --> 01:35:50.600
 It's very light.

01:35:58.048 --> 01:36:00.048
 Oh, here it comes.

01:36:00.048 --> 01:36:02.048
 This is...

01:36:07.048 --> 01:36:08.048
 It's quite long.

01:36:08.048 --> 01:36:10.048
 Let's do it in reverse.

01:36:17.048 --> 01:36:20.048
 This is our song, so let's do it again.

01:36:20.048 --> 01:36:22.048
 This song never stops.

01:36:24.856 --> 01:36:25.856
 The one you have now?

01:36:25.856 --> 01:36:26.856
 This one.

01:36:27.856 --> 01:36:28.856
 Let's open it.

01:36:28.856 --> 01:36:29.856
 Is it yours?

01:36:29.856 --> 01:36:30.856
 No, it's not.

01:36:30.856 --> 01:36:31.856
 It's not.

01:36:32.856 --> 01:36:33.856
 It's mine.

01:36:33.856 --> 01:36:34.856
 It's yours.

01:36:34.856 --> 01:36:35.856
 Mine?

01:36:35.856 --> 01:36:36.856
 One more time.

01:36:37.856 --> 01:36:38.856
 But it's...

01:36:39.856 --> 01:36:41.856
 It's going to be mine.

01:36:42.856 --> 01:36:43.856
 Should we shuffle?

01:36:43.856 --> 01:36:44.856
 Let's do it one more time.

01:36:45.856 --> 01:36:47.856
 Should we shuffle and turn it?

01:36:47.856 --> 01:36:49.856
 Please look forward to the next video!

01:36:50.304 --> 01:36:52.304
 Oh, that's it.

01:36:52.304 --> 01:36:54.304
 What?

01:36:54.304 --> 01:36:56.304
 1, 2, 3, jump!

01:36:58.304 --> 01:37:00.304
 This is fun!

01:37:00.304 --> 01:37:02.304
 It's good!

01:37:02.304 --> 01:37:04.304
 I hope this time will continue.

01:37:04.304 --> 01:37:09.304
 I hope this precious time will
continue.

01:37:11.304 --> 01:37:13.304
 It's not stopped!

01:37:13.304 --> 01:37:15.304
 Something is not stopped.

01:37:15.304 --> 01:37:19.304
 It's not stopped!

01:37:19.304 --> 01:37:22.304
 Let's start walking again.

01:37:22.304 --> 01:37:24.304
 It's not stopped!

01:37:24.304 --> 01:37:30.304
 It's not stopped!

01:37:30.304 --> 01:37:33.304
 It's a coincidence of a chance.

01:37:33.304 --> 01:37:35.304
 Who is it?

01:37:36.824 --> 01:37:38.824
 Stop!

01:37:39.824 --> 01:37:41.824
 It's not my song.

01:37:41.824 --> 01:37:42.824
 It's not my song.

01:37:42.824 --> 01:37:44.824
 It's not my song.

01:37:44.824 --> 01:37:45.824
 It's not.

01:37:45.824 --> 01:37:47.824
 It's over.

01:37:53.824 --> 01:37:55.824
 We should continue this time.

01:37:55.824 --> 01:37:57.824
 Let's go to the endless.

01:38:01.448 --> 01:38:03.448
 Let's go.

01:38:03.448 --> 01:38:06.448
 It's fun.

01:38:10.992 --> 01:38:12.992
 This one?

01:38:12.992 --> 01:38:14.992
 Not this one.

01:38:14.992 --> 01:38:16.992
 It's yours.

01:38:16.992 --> 01:38:18.992
 Let's spin one.

01:38:18.992 --> 01:38:20.992
 Spin it with your own bounce.

01:38:20.992 --> 01:38:22.992
 If you spin one, everyone gets white.

01:38:22.992 --> 01:38:24.992
 This is mine.

01:38:24.992 --> 01:38:26.992
 Let's spin the other one.

01:38:26.992 --> 01:38:28.992
 Let's spin one more.

01:38:28.992 --> 01:38:30.992
 Let's spin this one.

01:38:30.992 --> 01:38:32.992
 It's yours.

01:38:34.992 --> 01:38:36.992
 It's not fair.

01:38:36.992 --> 01:38:38.992
 Let's do it randomly.

01:38:38.992 --> 01:38:40.992
 I'll give you this one.

01:38:42.992 --> 01:38:44.992
 It's not about the round one.

01:38:44.992 --> 01:38:46.992
 This is not white.

01:38:46.992 --> 01:38:48.992
 It's mine.

01:38:48.992 --> 01:38:50.992
 Is this one OK?

01:38:50.992 --> 01:38:52.992
 The song is not finished yet.

01:38:54.992 --> 01:38:56.992
 What's this mess?

01:38:58.992 --> 01:39:00.992
 I'll give you this one.

01:39:00.992 --> 01:39:02.992
 I'll give you this one.

01:39:02.992 --> 01:39:04.992
 I'll give you this one.

01:39:04.992 --> 01:39:06.992
 I'll give you this one.

01:39:06.992 --> 01:39:08.992
 I'll give you this one.

01:39:08.992 --> 01:39:10.992
 I'll give you this one.

01:39:12.992 --> 01:39:14.992
 I'll give you this one.

01:39:14.992 --> 01:39:16.992
 I'll give you this one.

01:39:16.992 --> 01:39:18.992
 It's not mine.

01:39:18.992 --> 01:39:20.992
 It's not mine.

01:39:20.992 --> 01:39:22.992
 I got it.

01:39:22.992 --> 01:39:24.992
 I ignored the round one.

01:39:24.992 --> 01:39:26.992
 What's this?

01:39:26.992 --> 01:39:28.992
 I'm curious about the comment.

01:39:30.992 --> 01:39:32.992
 It's a mess.

01:39:32.992 --> 01:39:34.992
 I laughed.

01:39:34.992 --> 01:39:36.992
 I can't stop watching.

01:39:36.992 --> 01:39:38.992
 I can't stop watching.

01:39:38.992 --> 01:39:40.992
 Which one do you want to open?

01:39:40.992 --> 01:39:45.328
 Let's open this one.

01:39:46.328 --> 01:39:47.328
 It's cute.

01:39:49.328 --> 01:39:51.328
 What should we do? Should we say who it
is first?

01:39:51.328 --> 01:39:52.328
 Let's not say.

01:39:52.328 --> 01:39:53.328
 Let's guess.

01:39:54.328 --> 01:39:56.328
 But we might know who it is.

01:40:04.328 --> 01:40:05.328
 Ta-da!

01:40:06.328 --> 01:40:07.328
 What's inside the box?

01:40:07.328 --> 01:40:08.328
 What's this?

01:40:11.328 --> 01:40:12.328
 I think we know who it is.

01:40:12.328 --> 01:40:13.328
 Ta-da!

01:40:13.328 --> 01:40:14.328
 What's this?

01:40:14.328 --> 01:40:17.850
 What's inside the box?

01:40:17.850 --> 01:40:19.850
 So cute!

01:40:20.570 --> 01:40:22.570
 Do you know who it is?

01:40:22.570 --> 01:40:24.570
 It's Oharu.

01:40:24.570 --> 01:40:28.570
 It's the cute flower bouquet from the
first episode.

01:40:30.570 --> 01:40:32.570
 Doesn't it look like me?

01:40:35.570 --> 01:40:37.570
 It might look like you.

01:40:37.570 --> 01:40:39.570
 It's like an animal.

01:40:41.570 --> 01:40:47.570
 Kanamin said she wanted a bouquet with
her name on it.

01:40:47.570 --> 01:40:50.570
 So Oharu is here.

01:40:50.570 --> 01:40:52.570
 She's always with me.

01:40:53.570 --> 01:40:57.570
 The pink case and the chupa chups
are...

01:40:57.570 --> 01:40:59.570
 I don't usually buy them.

01:40:59.570 --> 01:41:02.570
 I thought it would be nice.

01:41:02.570 --> 01:41:04.570
 So I bought them.

01:41:05.570 --> 01:41:07.570
 Thank you.

01:41:07.570 --> 01:41:10.912
 Please subscribe to this channel.

01:41:11.912 --> 01:41:12.912
 We look alike.

01:41:14.912 --> 01:41:17.912
 I'll take you anywhere with my pet.

01:41:18.912 --> 01:41:19.912
 I'll take you to a live show.

01:41:20.912 --> 01:41:22.912
 I hope you'll put it on my costume
someday.

01:41:23.912 --> 01:41:24.912
 I'll take you to Tokikuri.

01:41:29.912 --> 01:41:30.912
 Next, Julia.

01:41:30.912 --> 01:41:33.440
 Who is it?

01:41:34.440 --> 01:41:36.440
 I saw a package.

01:41:38.440 --> 01:41:39.440
 Who is it?

01:41:42.440 --> 01:41:43.440
 What is it?

01:41:46.440 --> 01:41:48.440
 Aroma sticker for mask.

01:41:48.440 --> 01:41:55.440
 Please subscribe to this channel.

01:41:55.962 --> 01:41:57.962
 Lavender herb.

01:41:57.962 --> 01:41:59.962
 Where do you put it?

01:41:59.962 --> 01:42:01.962
 She found out.

01:42:01.962 --> 01:42:03.962
 This is from me.

01:42:05.962 --> 01:42:07.962
 This is a mask.

01:42:07.962 --> 01:42:09.962
 It's not lavender.

01:42:09.962 --> 01:42:11.962
 It's a mask sticker.

01:42:11.962 --> 01:42:13.962
 It's a mask sticker.

01:42:15.962 --> 01:42:17.962
 I forgot.

01:42:19.962 --> 01:42:23.962
 This is a mask that sterilizes the
environment.

01:42:23.962 --> 01:42:25.962
 It sterilizes the air.

01:42:25.962 --> 01:42:27.962
 You can use it as a mist.

01:42:27.962 --> 01:42:30.962
 You can use it as a mist for the air
and the mask.

01:42:30.962 --> 01:42:33.962
 It has a very nice scent.

01:42:33.962 --> 01:42:35.962
 It smells fashionable.

01:42:38.962 --> 01:42:40.962
 It sterilizes the air.

01:42:43.962 --> 01:42:44.962
 How is it?

01:42:44.962 --> 01:42:45.962
 Does it smell good?

01:42:45.962 --> 01:42:47.856
 Yes.

01:42:48.856 --> 01:42:49.856
 Thank you!

01:42:54.856 --> 01:42:55.856
 Next is Hitoka!

01:42:56.856 --> 01:42:57.856
 What is this?

01:42:58.856 --> 01:42:59.856
 There is something like this in it.

01:43:00.856 --> 01:43:01.856
 It's cute.

01:43:03.856 --> 01:43:04.856
 What is this?

01:43:08.856 --> 01:43:09.856
 You are laughing a lot.

01:43:09.856 --> 01:43:10.856
 Thank you!

01:43:14.976 --> 01:43:18.976
 I'm glad I like this chocolate.

01:43:22.976 --> 01:43:23.976
 What is this?

01:43:24.976 --> 01:43:25.976
 I'll open it.

01:43:37.976 --> 01:43:39.976
 I'm looking forward to opening it.

01:43:39.976 --> 01:43:42.976
 What is this?

01:43:44.048 --> 01:43:46.048
 What is this?

01:43:47.048 --> 01:43:49.048
 It's a picture of Aki-chan.

01:43:49.048 --> 01:43:50.048
 I was found out.

01:43:50.048 --> 01:43:52.048
 Everyone, this is Aki-chan.

01:43:53.048 --> 01:43:55.048
 The clerk is taking good care of me.

01:44:02.048 --> 01:44:04.048
 It's Pakkun-chan.

01:44:05.048 --> 01:44:07.048
 I don't know if she'll be happy.

01:44:07.048 --> 01:44:08.048
 I'm very happy.

01:44:08.048 --> 01:44:10.048
 Really? Thank you.

01:44:10.048 --> 01:44:12.048
 What is this?

01:44:13.232 --> 01:44:15.232
 There is a box inside the box.

01:44:16.232 --> 01:44:18.232
 This is a Louis Vuitton City.

01:44:19.232 --> 01:44:22.232
 It is a Louis Vuitton City and a
D-Store.

01:44:23.232 --> 01:44:25.232
 It is a Louis Vuitton City in Denmark.

01:44:26.232 --> 01:44:29.232
 I love Louis Vuitton City and I always
drink it.

01:44:30.232 --> 01:44:34.232
 The lyrics of Lion Girl also contain
the lyrics of Louis Vuitton City.

01:44:35.232 --> 01:44:41.232
 I made it a Louis Vuitton City for
everyone to drink it.

01:44:41.232 --> 01:44:46.232
 I will drink it after taking a nap.

01:44:47.232 --> 01:44:49.232
 I am glad. I like tea very much.

01:44:50.232 --> 01:44:52.232
 I was addicted to tea.

01:44:53.232 --> 01:44:54.232
 Thank you very much.

01:44:55.232 --> 01:44:58.232
 The chocolate is a bonus.

01:44:59.232 --> 01:45:01.232
 I found it at the store and brought it.

01:45:02.232 --> 01:45:03.232
 I love chocolate.

01:45:04.232 --> 01:45:05.232
 I am glad. Thank you.

01:45:08.232 --> 01:45:09.232
 It is fashionable.

01:45:09.232 --> 01:45:11.232
 Everyone is fashionable.

01:45:12.232 --> 01:45:13.232
 I will open this.

01:45:14.232 --> 01:45:15.232
 Who is this?

01:45:16.232 --> 01:45:17.232
 It is big.

01:45:18.232 --> 01:45:19.232
 It is a red bag.

01:45:20.232 --> 01:45:21.232
 Who is this?

01:45:22.232 --> 01:45:23.232
 It is a pen.

01:45:23.232 --> 01:45:26.576
 I am glad. I like it.

01:45:28.680 --> 01:45:30.680
 I can see the name.

01:45:30.680 --> 01:45:31.680
 I can see the name.

01:45:31.680 --> 01:45:35.680
 It says by Hiyori.

01:45:36.680 --> 01:45:38.680
 This is a gift for spring.

01:45:38.680 --> 01:45:40.680
 It is a gift from Hiyori.

01:45:40.680 --> 01:45:41.680
 I will open it.

01:45:41.680 --> 01:45:42.680
 What is it?

01:45:42.680 --> 01:45:43.680
 It is big.

01:45:43.680 --> 01:45:44.680
 Yes, it is.

01:45:44.680 --> 01:45:45.680
 What is it?

01:45:45.680 --> 01:45:47.680
 It is quite a lot.

01:45:48.680 --> 01:45:49.680
 What is this?

01:45:50.680 --> 01:45:51.680
 What is this?

01:45:51.680 --> 01:45:52.680
 Is it a memo?

01:45:52.680 --> 01:45:53.680
 What is it?

01:45:53.680 --> 01:45:54.680
 What is it?

01:45:54.680 --> 01:45:55.680
 Is it a tomato?

01:45:55.680 --> 01:45:56.680
 It is a tomato.

01:45:56.680 --> 01:45:57.680
 It is a tomato.

01:45:57.680 --> 01:45:58.680
 It is a tomato.

01:46:01.384 --> 01:46:03.384
 Wow!

01:46:04.384 --> 01:46:06.384
 It is cute!

01:46:06.384 --> 01:46:08.384
 It is like a room-air.

01:46:10.384 --> 01:46:12.384
 It is a chopsticks.

01:46:13.384 --> 01:46:17.384
 I wanted to buy this chocolate for
everyone.

01:46:17.384 --> 01:46:18.384
 Is that so?

01:46:18.384 --> 01:46:21.384
 It is a chocolate and a milk.

01:46:21.384 --> 01:46:22.384
 Can I open it?

01:46:22.384 --> 01:46:23.360
 Thank you.

01:46:24.360 --> 01:46:25.360
 It is cute.

01:46:25.360 --> 01:46:26.360
 It looks like a doll.

01:46:27.360 --> 01:46:28.360
 It looks like a girl.

01:46:29.360 --> 01:46:30.360
 Look!

01:46:30.360 --> 01:46:31.360
 It is cute.

01:46:35.360 --> 01:46:36.360
 Please take a picture.

01:46:36.360 --> 01:46:39.360
 This is my second time to take a
picture.

01:46:43.360 --> 01:46:45.360
 It is cute.

01:46:46.360 --> 01:46:47.360
 It is a rainbow.

01:46:47.360 --> 01:46:49.360
 Thank you.

01:46:50.440 --> 01:46:52.440
 I will take a TikTok video with this.

01:46:55.440 --> 01:46:58.440
 I am a member of staff and a senior
member.

01:46:59.440 --> 01:47:04.440
 I can't see the fun side of senior
members.

01:47:05.440 --> 01:47:06.440
 This is cute.

01:47:07.440 --> 01:47:08.440
 This is a pajama.

01:47:09.440 --> 01:47:10.440
 Thank you.

01:47:12.440 --> 01:47:14.440
 I can see the strength of the female
power.

01:47:15.440 --> 01:47:16.440
 I wanted a pajama.

01:47:16.440 --> 01:47:17.440
 This is warm.

01:47:18.440 --> 01:47:19.440
 This is warm. I am happy.

01:47:19.440 --> 01:47:20.440
 Thank you.

01:47:25.786 --> 01:47:27.786
 Who is this?

01:47:29.786 --> 01:47:31.786
 I'm going.

01:47:33.786 --> 01:47:35.786
 Wait.

01:47:35.786 --> 01:47:37.786
 This is...

01:47:37.786 --> 01:47:39.786
 What?

01:47:39.786 --> 01:47:41.786
 Kanami?

01:47:41.786 --> 01:47:43.786
 Oh, no!

01:47:45.464 --> 01:47:46.464
 I'm so happy!

01:47:47.464 --> 01:47:48.464
 Wow!

01:47:49.464 --> 01:47:52.464
 This is the one we were talking about
earlier.

01:47:53.464 --> 01:47:57.464
 I was like, huh? I bought this!

01:48:00.464 --> 01:48:01.464
 I'm so happy!

01:48:01.464 --> 01:48:02.464
 I'm so happy!

01:48:02.464 --> 01:48:03.464
 I'm so happy!

01:48:03.464 --> 01:48:07.162
 I'm so happy!

01:48:07.162 --> 01:48:09.162
 It was a little heavy.

01:48:09.162 --> 01:48:11.162
 Yeah, it was heavy.

01:48:11.162 --> 01:48:12.162
 The light.

01:48:12.162 --> 01:48:13.162
 The actress light.

01:48:13.162 --> 01:48:14.162
 The actress light.

01:48:14.162 --> 01:48:16.162
 I forgot to bring the mirror.

01:48:16.162 --> 01:48:17.162
 Oh, yeah.

01:48:17.162 --> 01:48:18.162
 You should reflect it.

01:48:18.162 --> 01:48:20.162
 Put it in the bag.

01:48:20.162 --> 01:48:24.162
 Aki-chan's makeup is better.

01:48:24.162 --> 01:48:25.162
 Yeah.

01:48:25.162 --> 01:48:28.162
 I'll bring the mirror.

01:48:28.162 --> 01:48:30.162
 Everyone uses a mirror.

01:48:30.162 --> 01:48:31.162
 I'm glad.

01:48:31.162 --> 01:48:33.162
 I'd be happy if I got this.

01:48:33.162 --> 01:48:36.162
 I don't buy it often.

01:48:36.162 --> 01:48:40.162
 I'd like to give a brave present.

01:48:40.162 --> 01:48:43.162
 There's a page in it.

01:48:43.162 --> 01:48:47.162
 You can use it later.

01:48:47.162 --> 01:48:48.162
 Oh, sorry.

01:48:48.162 --> 01:48:51.162
 I'm sorry for the pajamas.

01:48:51.162 --> 01:48:52.162
 I'm glad.

01:48:52.162 --> 01:48:54.162
 The last is Hiyori.

01:48:54.162 --> 01:48:58.162
 Who chose this present?

01:48:58.162 --> 01:49:03.162
 It was fun last year.

01:49:03.162 --> 01:49:07.162
 I'm serious this time.

01:49:07.162 --> 01:49:08.162
 This is it.

01:49:08.162 --> 01:49:10.162
 Can I say something?

01:49:10.162 --> 01:49:12.162
 It's a convenient size.

01:49:12.162 --> 01:49:14.162
 It's easy to use.

01:49:14.162 --> 01:49:15.162
 It's a convenient size.

01:49:15.162 --> 01:49:17.162
 I don't think Hiyori has much.

01:49:17.162 --> 01:49:18.162
 Really?

01:49:18.162 --> 01:49:19.162
 I'm serious.

01:49:19.162 --> 01:49:21.162
 There's no candy in it.

01:49:21.162 --> 01:49:26.162
 Last year, I bought a chocolate in the
shape of a rugby.

01:49:26.162 --> 01:49:26.672
 I'm serious.

01:49:27.672 --> 01:49:28.672
 What is it?

01:49:28.672 --> 01:49:30.672
 It's cute.

01:49:33.178 --> 01:49:35.178
 So cute!

01:49:35.178 --> 01:49:37.178
 So cute!

01:49:37.178 --> 01:49:39.178
 There's nothing in it.

01:49:39.178 --> 01:49:41.178
 There's nothing in it.

01:49:41.178 --> 01:49:43.178
 Wait a minute.

01:49:43.178 --> 01:49:45.178
 There's something in it!

01:49:45.178 --> 01:49:47.178
 There's something in it!

01:49:47.178 --> 01:49:49.178
 Fried chicken!

01:49:49.178 --> 01:49:51.178
 Open it!

01:49:51.178 --> 01:49:53.178
 She's just made a decision.

01:49:53.178 --> 01:49:55.178
 There's fried chicken in it.

01:49:55.178 --> 01:49:57.178
 It's good.

01:49:57.178 --> 01:49:59.178
 I can't eat it.

01:49:59.178 --> 01:50:01.178
 I'll open it.

01:50:01.178 --> 01:50:03.178
 I'll open it.

01:50:06.906 --> 01:50:08.906
 I'm looking forward to it.

01:50:10.906 --> 01:50:11.906
 Great!

01:50:11.906 --> 01:50:13.906
 You are good at speaking Japanese.

01:50:16.360 --> 01:50:17.360
 What is that?

01:50:18.360 --> 01:50:19.360
 What is this?

01:50:20.360 --> 01:50:21.360
 What is this?

01:50:22.360 --> 01:50:23.360
 What is that?

01:50:24.360 --> 01:50:25.360
 Open it.

01:50:26.360 --> 01:50:27.360
 Can I open it?

01:50:28.360 --> 01:50:29.360
 I got it.

01:50:30.360 --> 01:50:31.360
 This feeling is...

01:50:33.360 --> 01:50:34.360
 This feeling is...

01:50:35.360 --> 01:50:36.360
 Where is it?

01:50:38.360 --> 01:50:39.360
 I love this square.

01:50:42.360 --> 01:50:43.360
 Try to open it.

01:50:43.360 --> 01:50:44.360
 It's a low-resolution.

01:50:44.360 --> 01:50:45.360
 Low-resolution?

01:50:46.360 --> 01:50:47.360
 Low-resolution is good.

01:50:48.360 --> 01:50:49.360
 It's good.

01:50:50.360 --> 01:50:51.360
 Cute.

01:50:53.360 --> 01:50:56.360
 I ate both cake and chicken.

01:50:58.360 --> 01:50:59.360
 Thank you.

01:51:00.360 --> 01:51:01.360
 I'm glad.

01:51:01.360 --> 01:51:02.360
 It's cute.

01:51:02.360 --> 01:51:04.360
 I don't need to buy a squeeze.

01:51:04.360 --> 01:51:05.360
 Right?

01:51:06.360 --> 01:51:07.360
 You are a good girl.

01:51:08.360 --> 01:51:09.360
 Thank you.

01:51:10.360 --> 01:51:11.360
 Thank you, everyone.

01:51:11.360 --> 01:51:12.360
 Thank you.

01:51:15.032 --> 01:51:18.032
 It's fun. 965 people are watching.

01:51:18.032 --> 01:51:20.032
 Wow, amazing. We'll reach 1000 soon.

01:51:20.032 --> 01:51:21.032
 Thank you.

01:51:21.032 --> 01:51:24.032
 Shall we read some comments on Twitter?

01:51:24.032 --> 01:51:25.032
 Let's read some.

01:51:25.032 --> 01:51:27.032
 Jiria likes weird things.

01:51:27.032 --> 01:51:28.032
 No, I don't.

01:51:30.032 --> 01:51:31.032
 Cute.

01:51:32.032 --> 01:51:33.032
 Skin squeeze?

01:51:33.032 --> 01:51:35.032
 Yes, squeeze.

01:51:35.032 --> 01:51:36.032
 It's squishy.

01:51:36.032 --> 01:51:37.032
 It's soft.

01:51:37.032 --> 01:51:39.032
 Thank you.

01:51:39.568 --> 01:51:42.568
 I used to have this when I was little.

01:51:42.568 --> 01:51:43.568
 It was a squeeze.

01:51:43.568 --> 01:51:44.568
 It was popular.

01:51:44.568 --> 01:51:46.568
 Julia, your hands are in the way.

01:51:47.568 --> 01:51:49.568
 There's nothing in it.

01:51:49.568 --> 01:51:53.568
 Did you think it was an iPad?

01:51:53.568 --> 01:51:54.568
 I thought so.

01:51:54.568 --> 01:51:56.568
 It's amazing.

01:51:56.568 --> 01:51:58.568
 I thought it was a 3D printer.

01:51:58.568 --> 01:52:01.568
 I thought it was because I increased
it.

01:52:01.568 --> 01:52:03.568
 I added one zero.

01:52:03.568 --> 01:52:06.944
 I thought it was a 3D printer.

01:52:07.944 --> 01:52:09.944
 And she was a genius.

01:52:11.944 --> 01:52:13.944
 I'm so happy.

01:52:13.944 --> 01:52:15.944
 Everyone is so good at this.

01:52:20.944 --> 01:52:23.944
 Julia chose a serious one this time.

01:52:23.944 --> 01:52:26.944
 I chose a serious one.

01:52:32.282 --> 01:52:33.282
 Wow.

01:52:33.282 --> 01:52:34.282
 Are you coming?

01:52:34.282 --> 01:52:36.282
 Please give me a present too.

01:52:36.282 --> 01:52:38.282
 I'll exchange presents with my
boyfriend tomorrow.

01:52:38.282 --> 01:52:40.282
 I'll put a picture in it.

01:52:40.282 --> 01:52:41.282
 Wow.

01:52:41.282 --> 01:52:43.282
 You can do it, Kana-chan.

01:52:43.282 --> 01:52:49.282
 Okay, so earlier, Tsutaya, Chibuya
Tsutaya-san,

01:52:49.282 --> 01:52:51.282
 I'm not talking about the family,

01:52:51.282 --> 01:52:54.282
 but I'll connect you again.

01:52:54.282 --> 01:52:59.282
 Earlier, it was Sato-san from Tsutaya-
san,

01:52:59.282 --> 01:53:03.282
 but I'm going to make a call.

01:53:03.282 --> 01:53:07.282
 The video was not good,

01:53:07.282 --> 01:53:10.282
 so I'm making a call.

01:53:10.282 --> 01:53:19.450
 Let's say hello to everyone.

01:53:19.450 --> 01:53:24.750
 Students love collaboration projects.

01:53:24.750 --> 01:53:26.750
 Yes.

01:53:26.750 --> 01:53:32.750
 Good evening.

01:53:33.082 --> 01:53:35.082
 Hello?

01:53:35.082 --> 01:53:37.082
 Hello!

01:53:37.082 --> 01:53:39.082
 I'm Sato, a half voice friend of
Shibuya Star.

01:53:39.082 --> 01:53:41.082
 Sato-san!

01:53:41.082 --> 01:53:43.082
 Hello!

01:53:43.082 --> 01:53:45.082
 Please say hello first.

01:53:47.082 --> 01:53:49.082
 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6

01:53:49.082 --> 01:53:51.082
 To Sato-san's heart, rock on!

01:53:51.082 --> 01:53:53.082
 We are Super-Tekimichi-Sendai.

01:53:53.082 --> 01:53:55.082
 Thank you for your support.

01:53:55.082 --> 01:53:57.082
 Thank you.

01:53:57.082 --> 01:53:59.082
 Thank you for your support.

01:53:59.082 --> 01:54:01.082
 I'm sorry about earlier.

01:54:01.082 --> 01:54:03.082
 I'm sorry.

01:54:03.082 --> 01:54:05.082
 I'm sorry.

01:54:05.082 --> 01:54:07.082
 It's perfect now.

01:54:07.082 --> 01:54:09.082
 It's perfect.

01:54:09.082 --> 01:54:11.082
 Thank you for having Shibuya Tsutaya-
san.

01:54:11.082 --> 01:54:13.082
 Thank you.

01:54:13.082 --> 01:54:15.082
 Thank you.

01:54:15.082 --> 01:54:17.082
 It's also in the official song.

01:54:17.082 --> 01:54:19.082
 I'm so happy.

01:54:19.082 --> 01:54:21.082
 Thank you for the official song.

01:54:21.082 --> 01:54:23.082
 Thank you.

01:54:23.082 --> 01:54:25.082
 Today, we were able to

01:54:25.082 --> 01:54:27.082
 sell it

01:54:27.082 --> 01:54:29.082
 outside.

01:54:29.082 --> 01:54:31.082
 Thank you.

01:54:31.082 --> 01:54:33.082
 Thank you.

01:54:33.082 --> 01:54:35.082
 Do you have a favorite song

01:54:35.082 --> 01:54:37.082
 from Tokimeki ga Subete?

01:54:37.082 --> 01:54:40.128
 Favorite song?

01:54:40.128 --> 01:54:48.128
 Well, I think it's the official song of
the company.

01:54:53.128 --> 01:54:58.128
 By the way, there are 6 girls in the
album.

01:54:58.128 --> 01:55:02.128
 Who do you think is the cutest?

01:55:02.128 --> 01:55:04.128
 Well...

01:55:04.128 --> 01:55:07.128
 Well...

01:55:07.128 --> 01:55:10.128
 I think it's Momoka.

01:55:10.618 --> 01:55:12.618
 Yeah, that's right.

01:55:14.192 --> 01:55:16.192
 I'm sorry.

01:55:16.192 --> 01:55:18.192
 I'm sorry.

01:55:18.192 --> 01:55:20.192
 I'm sorry.

01:55:20.192 --> 01:55:22.192
 Yes.

01:55:22.192 --> 01:55:24.192
 I've decided.

01:55:24.192 --> 01:55:26.192
 Wow!

01:55:26.192 --> 01:55:28.192
 I thought it was definitely not.

01:55:28.192 --> 01:55:30.192
 Thank you very much.

01:55:30.192 --> 01:55:32.192
 It was a great spring.

01:55:32.192 --> 01:55:34.192
 It was a great spring.

01:55:34.192 --> 01:55:36.192
 Tsutaya Shibuya,

01:55:36.192 --> 01:55:38.192
 Thank you for your continued support.

01:55:38.192 --> 01:55:40.192
 Thank you for your continued support.

01:55:40.192 --> 01:55:42.192
 We will also sing

01:55:42.192 --> 01:55:44.192
 I will sing the official song.

01:55:44.192 --> 01:55:46.192
 Thank you.

01:55:46.192 --> 01:55:48.192
 I'll go play again someday.

01:55:48.192 --> 01:55:50.192
 I'll go play again someday.

01:55:50.192 --> 01:55:52.192
 Please do.

01:55:52.192 --> 01:55:54.192
 Can I have a word at the end?

01:55:54.192 --> 01:55:56.192
 Can I have a word at the end?

01:55:56.192 --> 01:55:58.192
 Anything is fine.

01:55:58.192 --> 01:56:00.192
 The product has been launched once,

01:56:00.192 --> 01:56:02.192
 and in the second stage,

01:56:02.192 --> 01:56:04.192
 We have a copy of the recommended one

01:56:04.192 --> 01:56:06.192
 We have a copy of the recommended one

01:56:06.192 --> 01:56:08.192
 We have a copy of the recommended one

01:56:08.192 --> 01:56:10.192
 We have a copy of the recommended one

01:56:10.192 --> 01:56:12.192
 We're preparing it.

01:56:12.192 --> 01:56:14.192
 We're preparing it.

01:56:14.192 --> 01:56:16.192
 We hope that all the fans will come

01:56:16.192 --> 01:56:18.192
 to the second floor of Tsutaya Shibuya.

01:56:18.192 --> 01:56:20.192
 Thank you.

01:56:20.192 --> 01:56:22.192
 Thank you.

01:56:22.192 --> 01:56:24.192
 Thank you.

01:56:24.192 --> 01:56:26.192
 Thank you!

01:56:28.442 --> 01:56:39.442
 Okay, it's time to reveal the answers
to the quiz.

01:56:39.442 --> 01:56:41.442
 I'll go first.

01:56:41.442 --> 01:56:48.442
 I asked what day is Aiken Kuma's
birthday.

01:56:48.442 --> 01:56:49.442
 The answer is...

01:56:49.442 --> 01:56:51.442
 Tokikuri!

01:56:51.442 --> 01:56:58.442
 December 26th is Aiken Kuma's birthday.

01:57:00.624 --> 01:57:07.136
 There were many correct answers. Thank
you so much.

01:57:07.136 --> 01:57:08.136
 Next, Juri.

01:57:08.136 --> 01:57:10.136
 Juri's question was,

01:57:10.136 --> 01:57:15.136
 what cake will I eat for Christmas this
year?

01:57:15.136 --> 01:57:16.136
 Juri's answer is,

01:57:16.136 --> 01:57:18.136
 ice cream cake!

01:57:18.136 --> 01:57:20.136
 Ice cream cake!

01:57:20.136 --> 01:57:21.136
 I'm glad I said that.

01:57:21.136 --> 01:57:23.136
 Juri loves ice cream.

01:57:25.136 --> 01:57:26.136
 Next,

01:57:26.136 --> 01:57:31.136
 I asked what I prepare for Christmas
every year.

01:57:31.136 --> 01:57:33.136
 I gave you two hints.

01:57:33.136 --> 01:57:35.136
 One was cookies,

01:57:35.136 --> 01:57:37.136
 and the other was milk tea.

01:57:37.136 --> 01:57:38.136
 Milk tea!

01:57:38.136 --> 01:57:40.136
 I know that.

01:57:40.136 --> 01:57:41.136
 Really?

01:57:41.136 --> 01:57:46.136
 I prepare cookies and sweet milk tea
every year.

01:57:46.136 --> 01:57:48.136
 So, I'm sure you know the answer.

01:57:48.136 --> 01:57:50.136
 I don't think so.

01:57:50.136 --> 01:57:52.136
 These two hints.

01:57:55.136 --> 01:57:57.136
 My answer is,

01:57:57.136 --> 01:58:00.136
 Spain!

01:58:00.136 --> 01:58:04.136
 I said the country of the country,

01:58:04.136 --> 01:58:06.136
 but it's Spain.

01:58:06.136 --> 01:58:07.136
 Spain.

01:58:09.136 --> 01:58:10.136
 Akita.

01:58:10.136 --> 01:58:15.136
 I asked what color macarons I eat for
Christmas last year.

01:58:15.136 --> 01:58:16.136
 The answer is,

01:58:16.136 --> 01:58:18.136
 white!

01:58:18.136 --> 01:58:20.136
 I got it right!

01:58:20.136 --> 01:58:21.136
 What?

01:58:23.136 --> 01:58:26.136
 I'll get the answer right this time.

01:58:26.136 --> 01:58:27.136
 I'm not sure.

01:58:30.136 --> 01:58:31.136
 Next,

01:58:31.136 --> 01:58:33.136
 I asked Kanta,

01:58:33.136 --> 01:58:37.136
 who has the youngest memory of Hiori.

01:58:37.136 --> 01:58:41.136
 I asked what I prepare for Christmas.

01:58:41.136 --> 01:58:44.136
 I gave you four hints.

01:58:45.136 --> 01:58:46.136
 I said,

01:58:46.136 --> 01:58:47.136
 Popo!

01:58:47.136 --> 01:58:48.136
 So cute!

01:58:48.136 --> 01:58:50.136
 I asked Popo.

01:58:50.136 --> 01:58:52.136
 I think she's about three years old.

01:58:52.136 --> 01:58:55.136
 Did I get it right?

01:58:56.136 --> 01:59:02.136
 We'll draw a lottery to get the
handbell with the correct answer.

01:59:02.136 --> 01:59:04.464
 Thank you for watching!

01:59:05.464 --> 01:59:08.464
 Please pray for us!

01:59:09.464 --> 01:59:11.464
 We'll draw the handbell later.

01:59:12.464 --> 01:59:14.464
 Let's check out Twitter.

01:59:14.464 --> 01:59:17.464
 Thank you for tweeting.

01:59:19.464 --> 01:59:24.464
 We're doing a retweet project on
Twitter.

01:59:24.464 --> 01:59:30.464
 If you haven't done it yet, please
answer the questions.

01:59:32.520 --> 01:59:34.520
 You can get a limited edition of the
album.

01:59:34.520 --> 01:59:37.520
 Yes, it's a special Christmas album.

01:59:38.520 --> 01:59:42.520
 Lastly, let's say a message to each of
you.

01:59:42.520 --> 01:59:47.520
 Please listen to the songs in the album
with gratitude.

01:59:47.520 --> 01:59:50.520
 And also, let's say your aspirations
for TokiKuri.

01:59:50.520 --> 01:59:51.520
 Kanon-san.

01:59:51.520 --> 01:59:53.520
 Thank you so much for today.

01:59:53.520 --> 01:59:57.520
 Tokimiki was able to release all the
songs.

01:59:57.520 --> 02:00:00.033
 Please listen to the songs in the
album.

02:00:01.033 --> 02:00:04.033
 We were able to release a lot of songs.

02:00:05.033 --> 02:00:10.033
 It was a day that will remain in our
memories.

02:00:11.033 --> 02:00:17.033
 Today was a fun day because we
exchanged presents.

02:00:18.033 --> 02:00:22.033
 The actual Christmas is December 26th.

02:00:22.033 --> 02:00:29.033
 Let's spend a wonderful Christmas
together.

02:00:30.033 --> 02:00:34.033
 Let's spend a good day together.

02:00:35.033 --> 02:00:38.033
 We have no ceiling in our dreams.

02:00:39.033 --> 02:00:46.033
 I hope we can make more dreams come
true.

02:00:46.033 --> 02:00:51.033
 Let's share a lot of wonderful
excitement together.

02:00:52.033 --> 02:00:54.033
 Please continue to support us.

02:00:55.033 --> 02:00:58.033
 I'm waiting for December 26th.

02:00:58.033 --> 02:01:05.033
 Please watch the live broadcast.

02:01:06.536 --> 02:01:14.536
 Today, we are so happy to be able to
celebrate the release date of our album
with so many people.

02:01:14.536 --> 02:01:25.536
 We are so happy to be able to have a
fun Christmas party and release date of
our album.

02:01:25.536 --> 02:01:35.536
 As Kanami said, we are so happy to have
so many people supporting us at the
record shop and other places.

02:01:35.536 --> 02:01:41.536
 This is the first album since we
started APEX.

02:01:41.536 --> 02:01:45.536
 It's the first time for us to release
an album.

02:01:45.536 --> 02:01:49.536
 We were wondering how it would be.

02:01:49.536 --> 02:01:55.536
 We have 12 songs including good songs.

02:01:55.536 --> 02:02:00.536
 You have been listening to our new 5
songs since yesterday.

02:02:00.536 --> 02:02:09.536
 We are looking forward to the next
album.

02:02:09.536 --> 02:02:15.536
 We are preparing to make it the best.

02:02:15.536 --> 02:02:21.536
 We will make it the best.

02:02:21.536 --> 02:02:26.536
 Let's meet on the 26th.

02:02:26.536 --> 02:02:28.536
 We will do our best.

02:02:28.536 --> 02:02:30.880
 Thank you.

02:02:31.880 --> 02:02:34.880
 Thank you for watching the live stream.

02:02:34.880 --> 02:02:38.880
 I exchanged presents, ate cakes and
drank a toast with everyone.

02:02:38.880 --> 02:02:40.880
 It was very fun.

02:02:40.880 --> 02:02:44.880
 Today is the first day of the album
release.

02:02:44.880 --> 02:02:48.880
 I'm happy to spend such a fun time.

02:02:48.880 --> 02:02:52.880
 It's the first time for me to promote
my album.

02:02:52.880 --> 02:02:59.880
 I can release an album because of the
supporters.

02:02:59.880 --> 02:03:01.880
 Thank you very much.

02:03:01.880 --> 02:03:05.880
 There are a lot of good songs.

02:03:05.880 --> 02:03:08.880
 I think you've heard it.

02:03:08.880 --> 02:03:14.880

 We're on a business trip.

02:06:25.560 --> 02:06:30.560
 So, today is the day when all the songs
of TOKIMEKI are released.

02:06:31.560 --> 02:06:34.560
 Did you enjoy it with us?

02:06:36.560 --> 02:06:38.560
 The day when the songs are released is
so gorgeous.

02:06:39.560 --> 02:06:42.560
 Last time, we rode a bus.

02:06:43.560 --> 02:06:44.560
 You're laughing a lot.

02:06:44.560 --> 02:06:50.560
 This time, we read the comments
together like a Christmas party.

02:06:51.560 --> 02:06:54.560
 I was really happy to be able to
connect with you.

02:06:55.560 --> 02:07:03.560
 We put all the TOKIMEKI in all the
songs.

02:07:03.560 --> 02:07:13.560
 I hope you enjoy listening to them and
performing them live.

02:07:14.560 --> 02:07:19.560
 We'll also perform this song after
three days.

02:07:20.560 --> 02:07:23.560
 We'll also perform the song that we eat
cake and chicken.

02:07:24.560 --> 02:07:27.560
 We're having a lot of fun.

02:07:28.560 --> 02:07:29.560
 Hiyori's forehead is getting thinner.

02:07:29.560 --> 02:07:35.560
 Your cheeks are getting thinner.

02:07:36.560 --> 02:07:44.560
 I think there are some people who are
streaming, so we're having a live show.

02:07:45.560 --> 02:07:54.560

the true feeling of TOKIMEKI.
