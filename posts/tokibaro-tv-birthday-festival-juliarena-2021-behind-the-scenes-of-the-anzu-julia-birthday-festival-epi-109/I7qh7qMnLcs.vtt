00:00.000 --> 00:04.000
 Hello, I'm Ten-ten.

00:14.000 --> 00:17.000
 Hello, I'm Chigasaki.

00:17.000 --> 00:23.000
 I'm Jigen.

00:25.032 --> 00:29.032
 Oh, the one who was just in the water
tank.

00:29.032 --> 00:30.032
 Oharu-san.

00:30.032 --> 00:32.032
 I should change my clothes.

00:32.032 --> 00:33.032
 No, you shouldn't.

00:33.032 --> 00:35.032
 Pink doesn't suit you.

00:35.032 --> 00:36.032
 It suits me!

00:36.032 --> 00:38.032
 No, it's a throbbing pink.

00:38.032 --> 00:43.032
 I like pink, but this pink doesn't suit
me.

00:43.032 --> 00:45.032
 I'm usually not like this.

00:45.032 --> 00:47.032
 No, I thought you were amazing.

00:47.032 --> 00:49.032
 It suits you. It suits you so well.

00:49.032 --> 00:51.032
 It's already perfect.

00:51.032 --> 00:54.032
 I've been wearing it for 6 years, but
it doesn't suit me.

00:54.032 --> 00:55.032
 I agree.

00:55.032 --> 00:59.904
 It's amazing.

01:00.904 --> 01:01.904
 Which one do you like?

01:01.904 --> 01:02.904
 Mine?

01:04.904 --> 01:09.904
 I had two sandwiches for lunch, but I
had one more with my manager.

01:09.904 --> 01:10.904
 I had half of it.

01:11.904 --> 01:13.904
 I was full.

01:13.904 --> 01:23.904
 Thank you for watching! Please
subscribe to our channel!

01:23.930 --> 01:25.930
 I'm not sure if I can watch it again.

01:25.930 --> 01:27.930
 Change the frame.

01:29.930 --> 01:31.930
 I'll insert the Jiria.

01:31.930 --> 01:33.930
 I can't use it.

01:35.930 --> 01:37.930
 It's like a re-use.

01:39.930 --> 01:41.930
 Ice cake.

01:41.930 --> 01:51.930
 I'm excited even though I'm not the
main character.

01:52.314 --> 01:54.314
 I think I ate it.

01:54.314 --> 01:56.314
 I think so too.

01:56.314 --> 01:58.314
 I was wondering if you ate it.

01:58.314 --> 02:00.314
 I think so too.

02:00.314 --> 02:02.314
 I don't know.

02:02.314 --> 02:04.314
 We don't eat it.

02:04.314 --> 02:06.314
 I don't know.

02:06.314 --> 02:08.314
 I think I ate it.

02:08.314 --> 02:10.314
 I think so too.

02:10.314 --> 02:20.314
 I don't know.

02:22.616 --> 02:23.616
 I want to take it home.

02:24.616 --> 02:25.616
 I want to take it home.

02:26.616 --> 02:27.616
 I want to put it in the train.

02:28.616 --> 02:29.616
 I want to put it in my head.

02:30.616 --> 02:31.616
 I want to take it home.

02:32.616 --> 02:33.616
 It's cute.

02:37.616 --> 02:38.616
 I have never put it in my head.

02:39.616 --> 02:40.616
 Buzz?

02:41.616 --> 02:42.616
 I also have Disney.

02:43.616 --> 02:44.616
 I want to buy it.

02:44.616 --> 02:46.616
 Disney is cute.

02:49.800 --> 02:51.800
 I want to hold that and make it look
like I'm holding it.

02:52.800 --> 02:53.800
 The one that you hold a lot?

02:53.800 --> 02:55.800
 It's pretty popular.

02:56.800 --> 02:59.800
 I want to hold a lot of balloons and
make it look like I'm holding it.

02:59.800 --> 03:06.800
 If you're a staff, you can put it here
and let it go.

03:06.800 --> 03:07.800
 That's how you do it.

03:09.800 --> 03:10.800
 It's like I'm holding it.

03:14.800 --> 03:16.800
 That was the knowledge of the slug.

03:16.800 --> 03:18.800
 It's been a while since I've heard
this.

03:22.208 --> 03:24.208
 Oh, from now on, Tokiboro...

03:24.208 --> 03:26.208
 I'm sorry.

03:26.208 --> 03:28.208
 Why?

03:28.208 --> 03:30.208
 So...

03:30.208 --> 03:32.208
 I'll do my best in part 2.

03:32.208 --> 03:34.208
 Bye-bye.

03:34.208 --> 03:36.208
 What are we talking about?

03:36.208 --> 03:38.208
 It's just a chat.

03:38.208 --> 03:40.208
 It's cute.

03:40.208 --> 03:42.208
 I'm scared.

03:42.896 --> 03:52.896
 This program is a program where six
people who are active to promote
Tokimeki Monito challenge various things
and raise the barometer of Tokimeki in
the world.

04:12.896 --> 04:15.896
 I will prove it to you.

04:19.520 --> 04:21.520
 How about this?

04:21.520 --> 04:23.520
 I like it.

04:23.520 --> 04:25.520
 How about this?

04:25.520 --> 04:27.520
 How about pink?

04:27.520 --> 04:29.520
 I'm TAKIMUKI Pink.

04:31.520 --> 04:33.520
 This pink color looks good on me.

04:35.520 --> 04:37.520
 I'm getting rid of my eyebrows.

04:37.520 --> 04:39.520
 I want to make it look like a twin.

04:39.520 --> 04:41.520
 How do you like it?

04:41.520 --> 04:47.520
 I've only done one hair style today.

04:50.632 --> 04:51.632
 I'm not sure if I can eat it.

04:53.632 --> 04:55.632
 I think the bento looks delicious.

04:57.632 --> 04:58.632
 I'm not sure if I can eat it.

05:03.632 --> 05:05.632
 The bento looks delicious.

05:06.632 --> 05:08.632
 I've never had it before.

05:10.632 --> 05:11.632
 I'll eat it tomorrow.

05:11.632 --> 05:16.632
 I feel like I'm going to get a pimple.

05:19.640 --> 05:21.640
 I don't know.

05:21.640 --> 05:29.640
 I feel like I'm going to get a pimple.

05:36.378 --> 05:40.378
 See you next week!

05:40.378 --> 05:42.378
 Rock, paper, scissors!

05:45.378 --> 05:48.378
 Here comes the healthy mom!

05:50.378 --> 05:52.378
 Why did you get a eye injection?

05:52.378 --> 05:54.378
 I'm not wearing sunglasses, so I can't
go out.

05:54.378 --> 05:56.378
 Oh, you're not wearing sunglasses, so
you can't go out.

05:58.378 --> 06:03.378
 I'll do my best at the Tsuriyama Seikan
Festival!

06:03.378 --> 06:05.378
 Bye bye!

06:07.760 --> 06:27.264
 Subscribe to my channel!

06:27.264 --> 06:29.264
 I was singing.

06:29.264 --> 06:30.264
 I was singing.

06:30.264 --> 06:31.264
 Hello.

06:31.264 --> 06:35.264
 The next world tour will start in less
than an hour.

06:35.264 --> 06:38.264
 I'm Julia Imai, 21 years old.

06:38.264 --> 06:44.410
 Thank you to subscribe the channel and
share on social networks.

06:44.410 --> 06:46.410
 See you!

07:02.202 --> 07:07.202
 I drank the cider of July

07:07.202 --> 07:12.202
 I can't forget that night

07:12.202 --> 07:18.202
 It hurts, it hurts, I can't help but
feel lonely

07:18.202 --> 07:21.202
 The streetlights are a little dim

07:21.202 --> 07:25.202
 I'm waiting for you, my heart is
pounding

07:25.202 --> 07:28.506
 Your voice is...

07:28.506 --> 07:30.506
 January.

07:32.506 --> 07:34.506
 I said it clearly.

07:34.506 --> 07:36.506
 It's January.

07:36.506 --> 07:39.506
 I thought I said it wrong.

07:39.506 --> 08:00.506
 It's January.

08:00.538 --> 08:05.538
 The first day of the concert was a
success!

08:06.538 --> 08:08.538
 It was amazing.

08:09.538 --> 08:10.538
 It was great.

08:12.538 --> 08:16.538
 The 2021 JuriJuri Arena will start
soon!

08:17.538 --> 08:21.538
 I was on stage alone at the solo
concert last year.

08:21.538 --> 08:23.538
 This is the second time.

08:24.538 --> 08:26.538
 The point of the costume is...

08:26.538 --> 08:33.538
 It's not something you can see all the
time, but it's a big ribbon that you can
see from behind.

08:33.538 --> 08:42.538
 When I sing solo, there is a song that
starts with a back view.

08:42.538 --> 08:47.538
 I'm sure everyone will think it's cute
when they see it.

08:47.538 --> 08:50.538
 It's my favorite point.

08:50.538 --> 08:53.538
 It's on the other side of the screen,
but...

08:53.538 --> 09:05.538
 I hope I can show you a powerful
performance to the point where I can
deliver a lot of excitement to the other
side of the screen.

09:05.538 --> 09:15.538
 Please look forward to it! I'll do my
best!

09:15.610 --> 09:19.610
 I've been cutting for 30 minutes.

09:19.610 --> 09:21.610
 I'll do my best.

09:21.610 --> 09:33.610
 Please subscribe to my channel.

09:34.824 --> 09:36.824
 Julia Lee's Birthday Party!

09:36.824 --> 09:39.824
 If you think I look good in this
costume,

09:40.824 --> 09:43.824
 and if you like Julia Lee because she
is cute,

09:44.824 --> 09:48.824
 please subscribe to my channel and
click the good button.

09:48.824 --> 09:50.824
 Bye bye!

09:50.824 --> 10:03.770
 See you next week!

10:03.770 --> 10:05.770
 What's that?

10:05.770 --> 10:07.770
 What?

10:07.770 --> 10:09.770
 I don't know.

10:09.770 --> 10:11.770
 I don't know.

10:13.770 --> 10:15.770
 It's not a person.

10:15.770 --> 10:24.770
 Kanami, Chubiya, Hitoka, Naruka, Haki,
Riori, Super Tekimeki Tenden, Rock'n!

10:35.610 --> 10:52.928
 I'm going to sing a singing song of
love and

11:22.928 --> 11:23.546
 Bye bye!

11:23.546 --> 11:28.346
 Oh, hold on, you'll do me okay

11:28.544 --> 11:30.284
 Don't cry, it's here

11:30.284 --> 11:32.124
 Don't cry, it's here

11:32.124 --> 11:33.984
 Don't cry, it's a thread

11:33.984 --> 11:35.984
 Don't cry, it's a kiss

11:35.984 --> 11:37.984
 Once you bite it, you can't let go

11:38.624 --> 11:40.624
 You can't let go

11:42.264 --> 11:44.264
 You can't let go

11:45.904 --> 11:47.904
 You can't let go

11:49.664 --> 11:51.664
 You can't let go

11:52.464 --> 11:56.104
 The lion is shaking from the wind

11:56.104 --> 11:59.464
 The lion is running today

11:59.464 --> 12:03.544
 The days I spent with you

12:03.544 --> 12:08.064
 I'm sure it's not in vain

12:08.064 --> 12:10.064
 Even if it hurts, even if it hurts

12:10.064 --> 12:14.264
 I'm going to overcome the pain

12:14.264 --> 12:20.264
 But I'm glad I didn't cry

12:20.264 --> 12:26.264
 I found the end of the road I kept
running

12:26.264 --> 12:34.264
 I want to deliver the best melody of my
life

12:34.264 --> 12:40.264
 I want to sing with all my might

12:40.264 --> 12:44.264
 I won't lose, I'll shout again and
again

12:44.264 --> 12:48.264
 I heard the best melody of my life

12:48.264 --> 12:50.264
 I'm glad I didn't cry

12:53.064 --> 12:55.064
 I'm glad I didn't cry.

12:55.064 --> 13:00.064
 The lyrics tell the story of Julia.

13:03.600 --> 13:05.600
 I'm the father.

13:05.600 --> 13:07.600
 Who is it?

13:07.600 --> 13:09.600
 I'm the father.

13:09.600 --> 13:11.600
 I'm the father.

13:11.600 --> 13:13.600
 I'm Julia's father.

13:15.600 --> 13:17.600
 I'll read it.

13:17.600 --> 13:19.600
 To the publicity staff who always
support me.

13:21.600 --> 13:23.600
 I turned 17 on the 15th of this month.

13:25.600 --> 13:27.600
 This is the third time I've been
invited to the Toki Festival.

13:27.600 --> 13:29.600
 This is the third time I've been
invited to the Toki Festival.

13:33.600 --> 13:35.600
 I've never had so many people celebrate
my birthday.

13:39.600 --> 13:41.600
 I'm so happy to receive a birthday
message.

13:43.600 --> 13:45.600
 Thank you for your support.

13:49.600 --> 13:51.600
 At the birthday party, I was alone at
the stage for the first time last year.

13:51.600 --> 13:55.600
 I was nervous at the time, but I
thought it was a lot of fun.

13:57.600 --> 13:59.600
 I was very happy to be able to do it
again this year.

14:01.600 --> 14:03.600
 In 2020, I think there were times when
you felt dark and lost confidence.

14:07.600 --> 14:09.600
 But at that time, I was supported by
the message from the publicity staff.

14:13.600 --> 14:15.600
 I'm not used to being praised.

14:17.600 --> 14:19.600
 I'm not used to being praised.

14:19.600 --> 14:21.600
 I'm happy to hear that I'm a good
dancer.

14:23.600 --> 14:25.600
 I'm happy to hear that I'm a good
dancer.

14:25.600 --> 14:27.600
 I'm happy to hear that I'm a good
dancer.

14:29.600 --> 14:31.600
 I'll do my best to overcome it.

14:35.600 --> 14:37.600
 I was like that a year ago.

14:39.600 --> 14:41.600
 I couldn't express myself at that time.

14:43.600 --> 14:45.600
 But now, the Toki Festival is a very
strong bond.

14:45.600 --> 14:47.600
 It's warm and comfortable.

14:47.600 --> 14:49.600
 I can relax and enjoy Toki Festival
activities from the bottom of my heart.

14:53.600 --> 14:55.600
 I'm grateful to the publicity staff who
made such a place.

14:59.600 --> 15:01.600
 I want to make more memories with
everyone in 2021.

15:03.600 --> 15:05.600
 I want to make everyone smile.

15:05.600 --> 15:07.600
 I want to do my best at the age of 17.

15:07.600 --> 15:09.600
 Please continue to support me.

15:09.600 --> 15:29.600
 I'm going to do my best.

15:30.632 --> 15:38.632
 Happy birthday to you! Happy birthday
to you! Happy birthday dear Jiyu!

15:39.632 --> 15:40.632
 Oh, I was surprised.

15:41.632 --> 15:43.632
 Happy birthday to you!

15:44.632 --> 15:45.632
 Thank you!

15:46.632 --> 15:47.632
 Cute!

15:48.632 --> 15:49.632
 It's a straw.

15:50.632 --> 15:51.632
 It smells good.

15:52.632 --> 15:53.632
 Cute!

15:53.632 --> 15:56.632
 How is it?

15:58.152 --> 15:59.152
 It smells like fruity.

16:00.152 --> 16:01.152
 Does it smell like fruity?

16:02.152 --> 16:03.152
 Yes, it does.

16:03.152 --> 16:04.152
 It smells different.

16:04.152 --> 16:05.152
 Try again.

16:07.152 --> 16:08.152
 It's sweet!

16:11.152 --> 16:12.152
 I see.

16:13.152 --> 16:15.152
 You guys are the ones who want to make
me say it.

16:16.152 --> 16:17.152
 It was fruity.

16:17.152 --> 16:18.152
 It's sweet!

16:18.152 --> 16:19.152
 It's sweet!

16:19.152 --> 16:20.152
 It feels good.

16:23.216 --> 16:25.216
 It matches the costume.

16:25.216 --> 16:27.216
 It's so cute.

16:27.216 --> 16:29.216
 I got a cake.

16:29.216 --> 16:31.216
 It's heavy.

16:32.216 --> 16:34.216
 Thank you.

16:34.216 --> 16:38.216
 It was cute.

16:38.554 --> 16:40.554
 I was nervous.

16:40.554 --> 16:42.554
 I'm sorry.

16:42.554 --> 16:44.554
 What was that?

16:44.554 --> 16:46.554
 When you were practicing self-
introduction?

16:46.554 --> 16:49.554
 When Julia first came on stage,

16:49.554 --> 16:51.554
 we practiced self-introduction.

16:51.554 --> 16:54.554
 We practiced shaking hands.

16:54.554 --> 16:57.554
 Julia and I shook hands once.

16:57.554 --> 17:00.554
 We did a lot of things.

17:00.554 --> 17:03.554
 Julia was so proud.

17:03.554 --> 17:06.554
 She was full of confidence on stage.

17:06.554 --> 17:08.554
 She was so confident.

17:08.554 --> 17:10.554
 Thank you.

17:10.554 --> 17:12.554
 I'm glad.

17:12.554 --> 17:14.554
 Thank you.

17:15.066 --> 17:20.066
 I'm going to bend the spoon.

17:30.066 --> 17:31.066
 It's bent.

17:32.066 --> 17:34.066
 It's bent a lot.

17:34.066 --> 17:37.066
 It's bent a little.

17:39.514 --> 17:41.514
 I'm going to start from here.

17:42.514 --> 17:43.514
 I can't do it.

17:44.514 --> 17:45.514
 You're going to fall.

17:46.514 --> 17:47.514
 I'm going to fall.

17:48.514 --> 17:50.514
 I think you can do it.

17:52.514 --> 17:53.514
 I can't do it.

17:54.514 --> 17:55.514
 You're amazing.

17:58.514 --> 17:59.514
 I can't do it.

18:01.514 --> 18:02.514
 It's MAJI.

18:04.514 --> 18:05.514
 Cool.

18:05.514 --> 18:07.514
 I'm done.

18:14.362 --> 18:17.362
 I remember the time when we met

18:17.362 --> 18:21.362
 Even if it rains, I'll smile

18:21.362 --> 18:25.362
 Look, let's go anywhere

18:25.362 --> 18:29.362
 Goodbye, goodbye, to me of yesterday

18:29.362 --> 18:33.362
 The city after the rain is sparkling

18:33.362 --> 18:36.362
 My heart is like a sunny pattern

18:36.362 --> 18:38.362
 I play the sound of a rainbow

18:38.362 --> 18:42.362
 I play the rainbow piano

18:42.362 --> 18:46.362
 Goodbye, goodbye, to me of yesterday

18:46.362 --> 18:50.362
 The city after the rain is sparkling

18:50.362 --> 18:52.362
 My heart is like a sunny pattern

18:52.362 --> 18:54.362
 I cry my tears out

18:54.362 --> 19:13.362
 I wear a rainbow dress
