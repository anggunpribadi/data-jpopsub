00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Ebichu's videos

2
00:00:08,346 --> 00:00:17,346
Now, I'm going to start the blind test
of the road of Kashiwagi Hinata.

3
00:00:18,346 --> 00:00:20,346
I'm nervous.

4
00:00:21,346 --> 00:00:25,346
There are 14 kinds of meat.

5
00:00:26,346 --> 00:00:27,346
I got it.

6
00:00:27,346 --> 00:00:29,232
Let's eat.

7
00:00:30,232 --> 00:00:36,232
Out of 14 questions, I got 10 right.

8
00:00:36,232 --> 00:00:38,232
I got more than 10 questions right.

9
00:00:38,232 --> 00:00:41,232
And the prize is a Yakiniku bento.

10
00:00:41,232 --> 00:00:48,232
I'll give it to the members of Umitube
as a reward.

11
00:00:48,232 --> 00:00:52,232
I'll do my best.

12
00:00:52,232 --> 00:00:57,232
I'll give Yakiniku bento to the members.

13
00:00:59,096 --> 00:01:00,096
I'll do my best.

14
00:01:00,096 --> 00:01:05,096
I'm nervous, but I'll do my best with
this eye mask.

15
00:01:05,096 --> 00:01:08,096
I'll put on my eye mask.

16
00:01:08,096 --> 00:01:10,096
Everyone, goodbye.

17
00:01:13,096 --> 00:01:16,096
I just thought it was orange and light
blue.

18
00:01:16,096 --> 00:01:19,096
It's noisy.

19
00:01:20,536 --> 00:01:22,536
I'm going to do it.

20
00:01:22,536 --> 00:01:24,536
It's noisy. I'm sorry.

21
00:01:24,536 --> 00:01:28,536
So, I'm going to start the Nixomelia's
road, the blind test.

22
00:01:28,536 --> 00:01:30,536
What is this?

23
00:01:30,536 --> 00:01:34,536
It would be great if I could tell by the
smell, but I can't tell at all.

24
00:01:34,536 --> 00:01:36,536
I'll eat it.

25
00:01:36,536 --> 00:01:46,536
What is this?

26
00:01:49,752 --> 00:01:50,752
What is this?

27
00:01:51,752 --> 00:01:53,752
I don't know at all.

28
00:01:54,752 --> 00:01:55,752
What should I do?

29
00:02:01,752 --> 00:02:02,752
What is this?

30
00:02:03,752 --> 00:02:04,752
Wait a minute.

31
00:02:05,752 --> 00:02:06,752
It's red.

32
00:02:07,752 --> 00:02:08,752
I know it's red.

33
00:02:08,752 --> 00:02:10,752
I know it's red.

34
00:02:16,442 --> 00:02:18,442
I should have swallowed it earlier.

35
00:02:18,442 --> 00:02:20,442
I should have tasted it a little more.

36
00:02:20,442 --> 00:02:21,442
Oh my god.

37
00:02:21,442 --> 00:02:22,442
It's gone.

38
00:02:22,442 --> 00:02:24,442
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

39
00:02:24,442 --> 00:02:26,442
Wait a minute.

40
00:02:26,442 --> 00:02:28,442
Well...

41
00:02:28,442 --> 00:02:30,442
The red one is the best.

42
00:02:34,442 --> 00:02:36,442
I don't know.

43
00:02:36,442 --> 00:02:38,442
But I should guess the order.

44
00:02:38,442 --> 00:02:43,442
Wait a minute.

45
00:02:44,484 --> 00:02:45,984
Sagari?

46
00:02:47,984 --> 00:02:49,484
Let's eat.

47
00:02:49,484 --> 00:02:50,484
Where?

48
00:03:00,058 --> 00:03:02,058
Thank you for watching.

49
00:03:13,562 --> 00:03:15,562
It's like a Kalbi.

50
00:03:15,562 --> 00:03:17,562
It's like a Kalbi.

51
00:03:19,562 --> 00:03:21,562
But which Kalbi is it?

52
00:03:21,562 --> 00:03:23,562
Which one is it?

53
00:03:29,562 --> 00:03:31,562
But...

54
00:03:33,562 --> 00:03:35,562
It's Jokalbi.

55
00:03:35,562 --> 00:03:41,562
Jokalbi.

56
00:03:44,538 --> 00:03:46,538
What is this?

57
00:03:53,298 --> 00:03:54,378
I'm wondering the taste.

58
00:03:56,118 --> 00:03:57,978
Is it Akamino Calvinsu?

59
00:03:57,978 --> 00:03:59,978
I'm going to eat it.

60
00:03:59,978 --> 00:04:13,978
I'm going to eat it.

61
00:04:14,810 --> 00:04:16,810
Hmm?

62
00:04:18,810 --> 00:04:20,810
It's good.

63
00:04:22,810 --> 00:04:24,810
Which one is it?

64
00:04:28,810 --> 00:04:30,810
What?

65
00:04:30,810 --> 00:04:32,810
Which one is it?

66
00:04:32,810 --> 00:04:34,810
It's a tongue.

67
00:04:34,810 --> 00:04:39,632
I don't know which one is which.

68
00:04:40,632 --> 00:04:42,632
I found a lot of hair.

69
00:04:45,632 --> 00:04:46,632
Jotan.

70
00:04:48,632 --> 00:04:49,632
Jotan.

71
00:04:50,632 --> 00:04:51,632
I'm sure.

72
00:04:52,632 --> 00:04:54,632
It smells different.

73
00:04:59,632 --> 00:05:00,632
Marucho.

74
00:05:00,632 --> 00:05:01,632
Marucho.

75
00:05:01,632 --> 00:05:13,632
Marucho.

76
00:05:14,266 --> 00:05:16,266
What is this?

77
00:05:26,970 --> 00:05:29,230
I know his feelings.

78
00:05:29,230 --> 00:05:31,370
She knows what I'm saying, don't you?

79
00:05:38,426 --> 00:05:40,426
It's a loin!

80
00:05:40,426 --> 00:05:42,426
loin loin

81
00:05:42,426 --> 00:05:44,426
It's loin

82
00:05:44,426 --> 00:05:58,074
Itadakimasu

83
00:05:58,074 --> 00:06:11,574
Thank you for your viewing.

84
00:06:11,674 --> 00:06:13,674
What?

85
00:06:14,674 --> 00:06:16,674
What is this?

86
00:06:16,674 --> 00:06:18,674
What is this?

87
00:06:19,674 --> 00:06:21,674
I don't know this meat

88
00:06:29,674 --> 00:06:32,674
I feel like I want to play Akami no Karu
again

89
00:06:32,674 --> 00:06:34,674
But I answered it before

90
00:06:34,674 --> 00:06:41,674
It's not this one, is it?

91
00:06:41,818 --> 00:06:45,818
Kalbi is a speciality of Japan, and
Japanese beef is a speciality of Japan.

92
00:06:45,818 --> 00:06:47,818
And Joe and Akami?

93
00:06:49,818 --> 00:06:51,818
Did I eat Akami Kalbi?

94
00:06:51,818 --> 00:06:53,818
Yes, you did.

95
00:06:53,818 --> 00:06:55,818
But it's pretty...

96
00:06:55,818 --> 00:06:57,818
It's Joe! Joe Kalbi!

97
00:06:57,818 --> 00:06:59,818
I'm sure.

98
00:06:59,818 --> 00:07:01,818
Joe Kalbi!

99
00:07:01,818 --> 00:07:03,818
Itadakimasu!

100
00:07:08,858 --> 00:07:10,858
What?

101
00:07:10,858 --> 00:07:12,858
What is this?

102
00:07:35,994 --> 00:07:37,994
Jorosu

103
00:07:37,994 --> 00:07:39,994
Jorosu

104
00:07:39,994 --> 00:07:41,994
Jorosu

105
00:07:59,194 --> 00:08:01,194
What?

106
00:08:04,194 --> 00:08:06,194
Harami?

107
00:08:06,194 --> 00:08:08,194
Chagari?

108
00:08:09,194 --> 00:08:11,194
Harami?

109
00:08:13,194 --> 00:08:15,194
Is it Jo?

110
00:08:17,194 --> 00:08:20,194
I don't know what Jo is.

111
00:08:20,194 --> 00:08:22,194
Hmm...

112
00:08:25,194 --> 00:08:27,194
Joharami?

113
00:08:27,194 --> 00:08:36,826
No derivation.

114
00:08:36,826 --> 00:08:41,826
Thank you for watching until the end.

115
00:08:46,586 --> 00:08:48,586
I'm lost.

116
00:08:53,586 --> 00:08:57,586
Is there any speciality or Japanese beef
left in Kalbi?

117
00:09:01,586 --> 00:09:02,586
I see.

118
00:09:03,586 --> 00:09:05,586
It's either one.

119
00:09:05,586 --> 00:09:07,586
Which one?

120
00:09:07,586 --> 00:09:14,586
I wonder if I bought a lot.

121
00:09:15,800 --> 00:09:19,800
I just ate it, but it was so soft and
delicious.

122
00:09:23,800 --> 00:09:24,800
Which one is it?

123
00:09:25,800 --> 00:09:26,800
Specialty.

124
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:28,800
Specialty Kalbi.

125
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:30,800
It's difficult.

126
00:09:31,800 --> 00:09:37,800
If I were a member, I would know.

127
00:09:37,800 --> 00:09:39,800
Who is the gourmet of the BBQ
restaurant?

128
00:09:39,800 --> 00:09:41,800
I think so.

129
00:09:43,744 --> 00:09:50,724
So Miyanomoto is the one who finds the
food and facts.

130
00:09:51,924 --> 00:10:00,644
And Mine will seem to look for the
traces.

131
00:10:00,644 --> 00:10:06,804
we get the other 4 dancers to help us.

132
00:10:06,804 --> 00:10:08,720
Thank you for watching.

133
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:14,720
I think Ayaba knows the most about
tapioca.

134
00:10:15,720 --> 00:10:17,720
What is the most memorable dish?

135
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:20,720
I suddenly remembered Yuasa-san.

136
00:10:21,720 --> 00:10:22,720
This.

137
00:10:23,720 --> 00:10:24,720
I remembered suddenly.

138
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:27,720
This is horumon, right?

139
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:29,720
No?

140
00:10:29,720 --> 00:10:37,720
I will eat.

141
00:10:40,250 --> 00:10:44,630
under eldest daughter

142
00:10:44,750 --> 00:10:45,790
This is a treatment of granm

143
00:10:45,830 --> 00:10:47,870
Why?

144
00:10:47,870 --> 00:10:49,950
Let's play.

145
00:10:49,950 --> 00:11:06,950
Thank you for watching!

146
00:11:07,034 --> 00:11:09,034
This is Japanese beef kalbi.

147
00:11:09,034 --> 00:11:11,034
No, it's not.

148
00:11:11,034 --> 00:11:34,106
Japanese beef kalbi.

149
00:11:39,546 --> 00:11:42,846
Next is The kavia pulled down by Watson.

150
00:11:42,846 --> 00:11:46,966
Sagari.

151
00:11:46,966 --> 00:11:48,966
Thank you for watching.

152
00:11:52,602 --> 00:11:55,042
Drive safely

153
00:11:56,222 --> 00:12:00,082
Please look forward to the next work

154
00:12:00,082 --> 00:12:01,342
Explo dat

155
00:12:01,562 --> 00:12:03,562
It was a tongue.

156
00:12:03,562 --> 00:12:05,562
I'm scared.

157
00:12:05,562 --> 00:12:07,562
I'm scared.

158
00:12:12,794 --> 00:12:14,794
I got half of it.

159
00:12:18,794 --> 00:12:20,794
No way.

160
00:12:20,794 --> 00:12:22,794
I got a lot.

161
00:12:22,794 --> 00:12:24,794
I did my best.

162
00:12:24,794 --> 00:12:26,794
Wait, I only got 6?

163
00:12:28,794 --> 00:12:30,794
I was so happy that I got 10.

164
00:12:30,794 --> 00:12:32,794
I got a lot.

165
00:12:35,432 --> 00:12:37,432
I didn't know that.

166
00:12:37,432 --> 00:12:39,432
I'm embarrassed.

167
00:12:39,432 --> 00:12:42,432
I got 6 out of 14 questions right.

168
00:12:42,432 --> 00:12:46,560
It's my first time.

169
00:12:47,560 --> 00:12:48,560
I did my best, didn't I?

170
00:12:49,560 --> 00:12:50,560
Congratulations!

171
00:12:51,560 --> 00:12:52,560
Thank you!

172
00:12:53,560 --> 00:12:58,560
I will study more about meat and try
again.

173
00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:04,560
That's all for today. I'm Nekusomurieru.

174
00:13:05,560 --> 00:13:06,560
I will continue!

175
00:13:07,560 --> 00:13:08,560
I will continue!

176
00:13:09,560 --> 00:13:10,560
Bye bye!

177
00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:13,560
That's a shame.
