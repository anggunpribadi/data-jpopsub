00:00.000 --> 00:02.000
 The next day

00:03.000 --> 00:05.000
 Good morning!

00:11.000 --> 00:13.000
 Good morning!

00:13.000 --> 00:16.000
 Good morning!

00:16.000 --> 00:25.000
 We are going to do our best!

00:28.720 --> 00:30.720
 Did you cut your hair?

00:43.152 --> 00:45.152
 Let's go.

00:45.152 --> 00:47.152
 Where?

00:47.152 --> 00:49.152
 Going to the studio.

00:49.152 --> 00:52.152
 And go to the audience and sit at the
back.

00:52.152 --> 00:54.152
 I got a Wi-Fi.

00:54.152 --> 00:56.152
 Really?

00:56.152 --> 00:58.152
 Why?

01:00.152 --> 01:02.152
 Oh, no.

01:07.152 --> 01:09.152
 Wow.

01:09.152 --> 01:11.152
 Wow.

01:11.152 --> 01:14.152
 I didn't expect this size.

01:14.152 --> 01:16.152
 Me, too.

01:16.152 --> 01:19.152
 I saw it, but I couldn't see it in the
video.

01:19.152 --> 01:22.152
 I can't see it in the video.

01:22.152 --> 01:25.152
 I can't see anything without a camera.

01:28.152 --> 01:30.152
 I was shocked.

01:30.152 --> 01:32.152
 They are going to the stage.

01:32.152 --> 01:35.152
 I don't know what to do because there
are so many cameras.

01:35.152 --> 01:37.152
 I don't know what to do.

01:37.152 --> 01:39.152
 I can't do it.

01:39.152 --> 01:41.152
 I'm going to do my best.

01:41.152 --> 01:43.152
 It's a little expensive.

01:43.152 --> 01:45.152
 I'm going to fall.

01:45.152 --> 01:47.152
 I can't do it.

01:47.152 --> 01:49.152
 I can't do it.

01:51.258 --> 01:53.258
 Great!

01:57.498 --> 02:03.498
 I was told by Hikaru this morning that
I'm bare-faced.

02:03.498 --> 02:16.498
 I usually put on makeup on Saturday and
Sunday, but today I'm going to put on
makeup, so I'm going to be bare-faced.

02:16.498 --> 02:19.498
 I was told that I was bare-faced.

02:22.498 --> 02:23.498
 I'm going in.

02:23.498 --> 02:26.498
 I'm going in.

02:27.578 --> 02:29.578
 How are you?

02:29.578 --> 02:31.578
 We are fine.

02:31.578 --> 02:32.578
 She is fine.

02:32.578 --> 02:36.578
 The manager is like that, so the
members are like that.

02:36.578 --> 02:40.578
 The manager is like that, so we are
like that.

02:40.578 --> 02:41.578
 That's right.

02:41.578 --> 02:43.578
 That's definitely true.

02:43.578 --> 02:44.578
 It's definitely true.

02:44.578 --> 02:47.376
 What else?

02:48.376 --> 02:49.376
 I want to see it.

03:03.376 --> 03:04.376
 It's over.

03:04.376 --> 03:06.376
 I'll do my best.

03:07.376 --> 03:08.376
 I'm nervous.

03:09.376 --> 03:10.376
 Something is coming.

03:10.376 --> 03:12.376
 A zombie has come.

03:16.922 --> 03:18.922
 Hey!

03:20.922 --> 03:24.922
 I've been able to realize that I'm on
your side.

03:24.922 --> 03:25.922
 What do you mean?

03:25.922 --> 03:27.922
 I've been...

03:27.922 --> 03:33.312
 I think I'm unconsciously...

03:33.312 --> 03:35.312
 I thought I was an enemy.

03:35.312 --> 03:39.312
 I don't think you're an enemy, but I
think you're playing a role.

03:39.312 --> 03:41.312
 I thought I was being watched in
lessons.

03:41.312 --> 03:45.312
 Recording was like a test.

03:45.312 --> 03:50.312
 But recently, I've been able to
recognize that everyone is a team.

03:50.312 --> 03:53.312
 I'm having fun with lessons and
singing.

03:53.312 --> 03:54.312
 I'm glad.

03:54.312 --> 03:55.312
 For the sixth year.

03:55.312 --> 03:57.312
 I think of everyone as pets.

03:57.312 --> 03:58.312
 What?

03:58.312 --> 03:59.312
 What?

03:59.312 --> 04:00.312
 I'm a dog.

04:00.312 --> 04:01.312
 I'm a dog.

04:03.800 --> 04:05.800
 He is a painter.

04:07.800 --> 04:09.800
 He is Mr. Ikezuki.

04:12.800 --> 04:13.800
 He found out.

04:13.800 --> 04:15.800
 Did you take a picture?

04:15.800 --> 04:27.642
 He is cooking now.

04:27.642 --> 04:29.642
 I can't put it in my mouth.

04:30.642 --> 04:32.642
 I cooked it.

04:34.642 --> 04:35.642
 Look at this.

04:37.642 --> 04:38.642
 Honey oil.

04:38.642 --> 04:40.642
 I also got some candy.

04:40.642 --> 04:46.384
 I'm going to drink it.

04:47.384 --> 04:49.384
 Everyone is drinking.

04:50.384 --> 04:52.384
 I'm hungry.

04:53.384 --> 04:55.384
 I only have this, so I drink this.

04:55.384 --> 04:57.384
 I'm going to drink it.

04:57.384 --> 05:11.384
 Please subscribe to my channel.

05:11.514 --> 05:15.514
 It was so cute.

05:18.514 --> 05:20.514
 I wish I could calm down.

05:20.514 --> 05:21.514
 It was good.

05:21.514 --> 05:23.514
 No, it wasn't.

05:23.514 --> 05:25.514
 It's after the song.

05:25.514 --> 05:27.514
 That's the good part.

05:27.514 --> 05:29.514
 It's cute.

05:29.514 --> 05:34.514
 It's like watching Capybara after
meeting Ariana Grande.

05:34.514 --> 05:36.514
 It's cute.

05:36.514 --> 05:37.514
 Are you praising me?

05:37.514 --> 05:38.514
 I am.

05:38.514 --> 05:41.514
 It's cute.

05:41.514 --> 05:43.514
 It's like, it's cute.

05:45.514 --> 05:47.514
 It's not.

05:49.514 --> 05:51.514
 Capybara is cute.

05:51.514 --> 05:53.514
 It's like a baby.

05:53.514 --> 05:56.514
 Capybara is cute.

05:56.514 --> 05:58.514
 It's cute.

05:58.514 --> 05:59.514
 It's Capybara.

06:02.514 --> 06:03.514
 It's a cake scene.

06:03.514 --> 06:05.514
 Wrist, ankle, waist.

06:05.514 --> 06:09.514
 It's a flower.

06:09.514 --> 06:12.514
 It's a flower.

06:12.514 --> 06:14.514
 It's a flower.

06:14.514 --> 06:15.514
 Wait a minute.

06:15.514 --> 06:16.514
 It's like a heart.

06:16.514 --> 06:18.514
 It's like a heart.

06:18.514 --> 06:20.514
 It's like a heart.

06:20.514 --> 06:22.514
 It's like a foundation.

06:22.514 --> 06:24.514
 We're going to start the show.

06:24.514 --> 06:26.514
 Thank you for your cooperation today.

06:26.514 --> 06:28.514
 Thank you for your cooperation.

06:28.514 --> 06:30.514
 Thank you for your cooperation.

06:30.514 --> 06:31.514
 Thank you for your cooperation.

06:31.514 --> 06:33.514
 Then, the last one is...

06:33.514 --> 06:37.766
 I'll be right back.

06:37.766 --> 06:42.686
 and at the other one is...

07:00.946 --> 07:06.706
 I want to have a chance.

07:06.706 --> 07:10.706
 Villagers are even closer now.

07:10.706 --> 07:13.706
 But it's not true problem.

07:13.706 --> 07:17.706
 Sorry we areловило Dust but it'd like
to tell you.

07:17.706 --> 07:18.714
 Doing brutal independent attitude can
do bad things

07:18.714 --> 07:26.654
 When we use it, such as stacking up,

07:28.154 --> 07:37.634
 we can see where each myriad drains
goes after the horse ride.

07:46.490 --> 07:49.990
 I didn't say that I would go back a
little.

07:49.990 --> 07:51.990
 But I'm going in a little.

07:51.990 --> 07:55.990
 Do you return it properly? If you don't
return it here, you'll look in a strange
direction.

07:56.990 --> 08:00.990
 And now, the two of you are a little
ahead, but it's okay.

08:00.990 --> 08:01.990
 So, 3.

08:01.990 --> 08:02.990
 3.

08:02.990 --> 08:03.490
 Eh?

08:03.490 --> 08:04.990
 No, 3.

08:04.990 --> 08:06.490
 5, 6, 7, 8.

08:06.490 --> 08:09.490
 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8.

08:09.490 --> 08:10.990
 You.

08:10.990 --> 08:11.920
 Ta-da.

08:11.920 --> 08:14.840
  pega understand

08:40.570 --> 08:43.570
 I finished the concert in various ways.

08:43.570 --> 08:49.570
 If I continue like this, it will be the
worst for me.

08:50.570 --> 08:51.570
 Thank you.

08:51.570 --> 08:52.570
 Thank you.

08:52.570 --> 08:53.570
 Is it okay?

08:53.570 --> 08:54.570
 Yes, it's okay.

08:54.570 --> 08:55.570
 Can I take a picture?

08:55.570 --> 08:56.570
 Yes.

08:56.570 --> 09:01.570
 Thank you.

09:02.600 --> 09:03.600
 Good.

09:04.600 --> 09:05.600
 Good.

09:05.600 --> 09:06.600
 Thank you.

09:06.600 --> 09:07.600
 Thank you.

09:14.682 --> 09:21.682
 I can't move.

09:21.682 --> 09:23.682
 I can't move.

09:25.682 --> 09:26.682
 That's all.

09:26.682 --> 09:27.682
 Thank you.

09:27.682 --> 09:30.682
 I can't move.

09:31.682 --> 09:32.682
 Let's go.

09:32.682 --> 09:43.682
 Go!

09:45.384 --> 09:47.384
 Nothing.

09:47.384 --> 09:48.384
 Yes!

09:49.384 --> 09:51.384
 Are you taking a picture of me?

09:52.384 --> 09:53.384
 Yes!

09:53.384 --> 09:54.384
 Which one?

09:54.384 --> 09:55.384
 This one!

09:56.384 --> 09:58.384
 And the skirt on the right.

09:58.384 --> 09:59.384
 The skirt on the right.

09:59.384 --> 10:00.384
 The skirt on the right.

10:00.384 --> 10:03.384
 What should I do?

10:03.384 --> 10:05.384
 Sing a song.

10:05.384 --> 10:06.384
 No.

10:06.384 --> 10:07.056
 If you close the door, I'll sing.

10:07.056 --> 10:10.076
 I put your name in the graph.

10:15.520 --> 10:17.520
 I'm a little nervous.

10:18.520 --> 10:20.520
 Should we do it in a line?

10:20.520 --> 10:21.520
 Yeah, let's do it in a line.

10:21.520 --> 10:22.520
 What should we do?

10:22.520 --> 10:24.520
 One hundred thousand renma.

10:25.520 --> 10:29.520
 One hundred thousand renma, I can't
lose.

10:29.520 --> 10:34.520
 I'll fight, I'll fight, I'll show you I
can do it.

10:34.520 --> 10:38.520
 I won't give up even if I fall down a
million times.

10:38.520 --> 10:43.520
 More, more, more, more, I'll aim higher
and higher.

10:43.520 --> 10:45.520
 Okay!

10:45.520 --> 10:46.520
 Everyone, laugh.

10:46.520 --> 10:49.520
 It's not perfect, but it's best to
enjoy it.

10:49.520 --> 10:52.520
 Everything that was on that stage is
correct.

10:52.520 --> 10:55.520
 If it's fun even if you make a mistake,
it's right.

10:55.520 --> 10:56.520
 That's right.

10:56.520 --> 10:57.520
 Yes.

10:57.520 --> 10:58.520
 It's a V.

11:02.520 --> 11:03.520
 It's easy.

11:05.520 --> 11:06.520
 It's easy.

11:06.520 --> 11:07.520
 I came to the right place.

11:07.520 --> 11:09.520
 I'm going to die.

11:09.520 --> 11:11.520
 One, two.

11:14.520 --> 11:16.520
 I'm going to die.

11:18.520 --> 11:20.520
 I think everyone can do it.

11:20.520 --> 11:21.520
 I think we can do it if we decide on
the flower.

11:21.520 --> 11:22.520
 That's right.

11:22.520 --> 11:25.520
 If we enjoy it in the dry out, we can
do it.

11:25.520 --> 11:26.520
 Let's do it.

11:35.520 --> 11:36.520
 I can do it.

11:36.520 --> 11:38.520
 I'm looking forward to it.

11:38.520 --> 11:39.520
 Everyone.

11:39.520 --> 11:40.520
 Urgh.

 OK

12:42.090 --> 12:44.090
 I'll leave it to you.

12:44.090 --> 12:46.090

 I'm going

13:00.090 --> 13:02.090
 Are you going?

13:02.090 --> 13:04.090
 I'm going

13:04.090 --> 13:06.090
 I'll do my best

13:06.090 --> 13:08.090

13:10.090 --> 13:12.090
 Everyone

13:12.090 --> 13:14.090
 I'm nervous

13:14.090 --> 13:16.090
 It's good, this tension

13:16.090 --> 13:18.090
 Everyone is in a hurry

13:18.090 --> 13:20.090
 I'm going

13:20.090 --> 13:22.090
 I'll do my best

14:05.858 --> 14:21.858
 B! B! B! B!

14:21.978 --> 14:26.978
 We all went around the place without
any audience.

14:26.978 --> 14:32.978
 It was too big at that time, so we
thought we couldn't get any audience.

14:32.978 --> 14:37.978
 We've never been here before, so we've
only seen the pictures.

14:37.978 --> 14:40.978
 It was a size that we didn't expect.

14:40.978 --> 14:44.978
 And the moment we got here, this
view...

14:44.978 --> 14:46.978
 It's so fun!

14:46.978 --> 14:48.978
 The view is amazing!

14:48.978 --> 14:53.978
 I thought everyone came to see us.

14:53.978 --> 14:57.978
 But it was 500 people at first, so it's
half the amount.

14:57.978 --> 14:59.978
 It's so fun!

15:09.696 --> 15:12.636
 very good

15:19.386 --> 15:21.386
 I think I know what it is.

15:21.386 --> 15:23.386
 I think so, too.

15:23.386 --> 15:25.386
 What should I look for?

15:36.386 --> 15:38.386
 I was looking for Wi-Fi.

15:38.386 --> 15:50.386
 «What are you doing, Ria?»

15:50.874 --> 15:53.874
 There was a back dancer in the back.

15:53.874 --> 15:54.874
 Oh, yeah!

15:54.874 --> 15:55.874
 I saw it!

15:55.874 --> 15:56.874
 I saw it!

15:56.874 --> 15:57.874
 I saw it!

15:57.874 --> 15:58.874
 I'm sorry.

15:58.874 --> 16:00.874
 RUN-chan was white, right?

16:00.874 --> 16:01.874
 Yes.

16:01.874 --> 16:05.874
 You know the ring that the angel put on
her head?

16:05.874 --> 16:07.874
 That was 20 yen.

16:07.874 --> 16:09.874
 20 yen?

16:09.874 --> 16:11.874
 Really?

16:11.874 --> 16:19.706
 I tried the magic.

16:20.706 --> 16:22.106
 Now now now,

16:22.106 --> 16:26.778
 Are you enjoying the last smart dress
of O-ICHIBAN LIVE?

16:26.778 --> 16:34.778
 I hope we can keep challenging
ourselves and move forward together.

16:34.778 --> 16:43.778
 We are like this, but we will continue
to work hard to become a good udon
restaurant.

16:43.778 --> 16:47.778
 I hope we can go to the udon restaurant
together.

16:47.778 --> 16:59.778
 Thank you very much for today.

16:59.962 --> 17:05.962
 Now, I will perform a new song.

17:13.050 --> 17:16.050
 Please listen.

17:16.050 --> 17:21.050
 There is a straight tomorrow.

17:30.682 --> 17:33.682
 Thank you so much, everyone!

17:37.216 --> 17:39.216
 It was good.

17:39.216 --> 17:41.216
 You sang well.

17:41.216 --> 17:43.216
 Thank you.

17:43.216 --> 17:45.216
 I only saw the peach.

17:45.216 --> 17:47.216
 What's wrong?

17:47.216 --> 17:49.216
 I cried.

17:49.216 --> 17:51.216
 What's wrong?

17:51.216 --> 17:53.216
 This hair is cute.

17:55.216 --> 17:57.216
 I was too excited.

18:01.216 --> 18:03.216
 I'm embarrassed.

18:03.216 --> 18:05.216
 It's a match.

18:05.216 --> 18:07.216
 It's a match.

18:07.216 --> 18:09.216
 It's over.

18:09.216 --> 18:13.216
 After this, I'll gather in my room and
eat cup noodles.

18:13.216 --> 18:15.216
 I'll jump on the bed.

18:15.216 --> 18:17.216
 I can't sleep.

18:17.216 --> 18:19.216
 Thank you.

18:19.216 --> 18:21.216
 Thank you.

18:21.216 --> 18:26.074
 Please subscribe to our channel.

18:26.074 --> 18:27.074
 Everyone!

18:27.074 --> 18:28.074
 You can do it, Ruma!

18:30.074 --> 18:31.074
 Everyone!

18:31.074 --> 18:32.074
 Everyone!

18:42.074 --> 18:43.074
 It's still spilling.

18:44.074 --> 18:45.074
 It's spilling!

18:45.074 --> 18:46.074
 It's spilling!

18:46.074 --> 18:47.074
 It's spilling!

18:53.074 --> 18:54.074
 Thank you very much!

18:54.074 --> 18:55.074
 Thank you!

18:55.074 --> 18:56.074
 Thank you!

18:57.434 --> 18:59.434
 See you again!

18:59.434 --> 19:01.434
 See you again!

19:03.434 --> 19:05.434
 Thank you!

19:05.434 --> 19:07.434
 Bye!
