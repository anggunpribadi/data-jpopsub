And the main project is
Performed by only two members of Rough x Rough
"Two-shot talk!"

And this time, [Yui Takanashi (pinch hitter: Sasaki) → Mirai Fujisaki]

As a pinch hitter for Yui Yui, who was absent from the recording due to poor physical condition. Foo-chan became the questioner, Her first impression of Miku-chan and episodes that only I know, She hits herself with the contents of the questionnaire she received from other members in advance.

I think you can enjoy the relaxed atmosphere between the members this time as well.
