00:00.000 --> 00:02.000
 Thank you for watching!

00:02.010 --> 00:04.010
 Good morning.

00:04.010 --> 00:06.010
 Good morning.

00:06.010 --> 00:08.010
 What's going on?

00:08.010 --> 00:10.010
 We are at a park.

00:10.010 --> 00:12.010
 It's a nice day.

00:12.010 --> 00:14.010
 It's a nice day, but it's freezing.

00:14.010 --> 00:16.010
 It's freezing.

00:16.010 --> 00:18.010
 Today,

00:18.010 --> 00:20.010
 you usually travel by car, right?

00:20.010 --> 00:22.010
 Yes.

00:22.010 --> 00:24.010
 But,

00:24.010 --> 00:26.010
 you might have to travel by bicycle.

00:26.010 --> 00:28.010
 That's going to be tough.

00:28.010 --> 00:30.010
 I don't want to.

00:30.010 --> 00:32.010
 I can't.

00:32.010 --> 00:34.010
 You can't carry a suitcase in a basket.

00:34.010 --> 00:36.010
 I thought you might have to travel by
bicycle.

00:36.010 --> 00:38.010
 Yes.

00:38.010 --> 00:40.010
 I heard that

00:40.010 --> 00:42.010
 you can't ride a bicycle.

00:42.010 --> 00:44.010
 Who?

00:44.010 --> 00:46.010
 Who can't ride a bicycle?

00:46.010 --> 00:48.010
 I can't believe it.

00:48.010 --> 00:50.010
 Who is it?

00:50.010 --> 00:52.010
 It's me.

00:52.010 --> 00:54.010
 I heard that

00:54.010 --> 00:56.010
 you can't ride a bicycle.

00:56.010 --> 00:58.010
 I heard that

00:58.010 --> 01:00.010
 when you have to ride a bicycle,

01:00.010 --> 01:02.010
 someone has to ride a bicycle

01:02.010 --> 01:04.010
 for you.

01:04.010 --> 01:06.010
 That's going to be tough.

01:06.010 --> 01:08.010
 I'm going to be a burden.

01:08.010 --> 01:10.010
 I'm going to be a burden.

01:10.010 --> 01:12.010
 That's what I heard.

01:12.010 --> 01:14.010
 So,

01:14.010 --> 01:16.010
 we are going to teach you how to ride a
bicycle.

01:16.010 --> 01:18.010
 So,

01:18.010 --> 01:20.010
 we are going to teach you

01:20.010 --> 01:22.010
 how to ride a bicycle.

01:22.010 --> 01:24.010
 I'm going to teach you seriously.

01:24.010 --> 01:26.010
 We are going to teach you

01:26.010 --> 01:28.010
 how to ride a bicycle.

01:28.010 --> 01:30.010
 Leave it to me.

01:30.010 --> 01:32.010
 I'm going to teach you.

01:32.010 --> 01:34.010
 Of course.

01:34.010 --> 01:36.010
 I'm worried because I saw you playing
basketball.

01:36.010 --> 01:38.010
 I'm worried because I saw you playing
basketball.

01:38.010 --> 01:40.010
 Don't worry.

01:40.010 --> 01:42.010
 It doesn't matter whether you have good
or bad motor skills.

01:42.010 --> 01:44.010
 It doesn't matter whether you have good
or bad motor skills.

01:44.010 --> 01:46.010
 I'm also known as

01:46.010 --> 01:48.010
 the bicycle queen.

01:48.010 --> 01:50.010
 I'm famous in the street.

01:50.010 --> 01:52.010
 I'm famous in the street.

01:52.010 --> 01:54.010
 So,

01:54.010 --> 01:56.010
 I'm going to teach you

01:56.010 --> 01:58.010
 how to ride a bicycle.

01:58.010 --> 02:00.010
 I'm going to teach you how to ride a
bicycle.

02:00.010 --> 02:02.010
 Thank you.

02:02.010 --> 02:04.010
 I hope you can ride a bicycle

02:04.010 --> 02:06.010
 and go home.

02:06.010 --> 02:08.010
 I see.

02:08.010 --> 02:10.010
 I'm looking forward to your feedback.

02:10.010 --> 02:12.010
 Leave it to me.

02:12.010 --> 02:14.010
 Let's get started.

02:14.010 --> 02:16.010
 Let's go.

02:16.010 --> 02:18.010
 Let's go.

02:18.010 --> 02:20.010
 Let's go.

02:20.010 --> 02:22.010
 Let's ride a bicycle.

02:22.010 --> 02:24.010
 I prepared a bicycle.

02:24.010 --> 02:26.010
 I brought it from the sky.

02:26.010 --> 02:28.010
 Thank you.

02:28.010 --> 02:30.010
 I don't know what you are riding.

02:30.010 --> 02:32.010
 I don't know what you are riding.

02:32.010 --> 02:34.010
 I've never seen you riding a bicycle.

02:34.010 --> 02:36.010
 I've never seen you riding a bicycle.

02:36.010 --> 02:38.010
 I think I can ride a bicycle.

02:38.010 --> 02:40.010
 I think I can ride a bicycle.

02:40.010 --> 02:42.010
 I think I can ride a bicycle.

02:42.010 --> 02:44.010
 Let's see how good you are.

02:44.010 --> 02:46.010
 Leave it to me.

02:46.010 --> 02:48.010
 I'm scared.

02:48.010 --> 02:50.010
 I can't ride a bicycle.

02:50.010 --> 02:52.010
 I'm scared.

02:54.010 --> 02:56.010
 You are not in a good posture.

02:56.010 --> 02:58.010
 I'm not in a good posture.

02:58.010 --> 03:00.010
 What's going on?

03:04.010 --> 03:06.010
 Are you okay?

03:06.010 --> 03:08.010
 Did you ride a bicycle?

03:08.010 --> 03:10.010
 Well...

03:10.010 --> 03:12.010
 Yes.

03:12.010 --> 03:14.010
 I can't ride a bicycle alone.

03:14.010 --> 03:16.010
 I can't ride a bicycle alone.

03:16.010 --> 03:18.010
 So, I'll ask you

03:18.010 --> 03:20.010
 to teach me how to ride a bicycle.

03:20.010 --> 03:22.010
 to teach me how to ride a bicycle.

03:22.010 --> 03:24.010
 I see.

03:24.010 --> 03:27.088
 I want to ride a bicycle.

03:27.748 --> 03:28.608
 Wow

03:29.608 --> 03:31.608
 Let's start the bicycle lesson!

03:31.608 --> 03:32.608
 Let's do it!

03:32.608 --> 03:33.608
 Are you ready?

03:33.608 --> 03:34.608
 Yes!

03:34.608 --> 03:35.608
 Are you ready?

03:35.608 --> 03:36.608
 Yes!

03:36.608 --> 03:38.608
 This is a matter of spirit.

03:38.608 --> 03:39.608
 Yes!

03:39.608 --> 03:41.608
 I'll imitate you.

03:41.608 --> 03:42.608
 Yes!

03:42.608 --> 03:43.608
 Wow!

03:44.608 --> 03:45.608
 Wow!

03:46.608 --> 03:47.608
 Wow!

03:48.608 --> 03:49.608
 Wow!

03:50.608 --> 03:51.608
 Wow!

03:51.608 --> 03:52.608
 Wow!

03:55.608 --> 03:56.608
 Wow!

03:56.608 --> 03:57.608
 Wow!

03:58.608 --> 03:59.608
 Wow!

03:59.608 --> 04:00.608
 Wow!

04:01.608 --> 04:02.608
 Wow!

04:02.608 --> 04:04.608
 OK. Checking is over.

04:04.608 --> 04:05.608
 Yes!

04:05.608 --> 04:06.608
 Well, then,

04:06.608 --> 04:08.608
 First, I'll imitate your fear.

04:08.608 --> 04:09.608
 I see.

04:09.608 --> 04:10.608
 You don't want to fall down.

04:10.608 --> 04:12.608
 You don't want to fall down.

04:12.608 --> 04:14.608
 In order to pay the fee,

04:14.608 --> 04:15.608
 please imitate me.

04:15.608 --> 04:16.608
 Again?

04:16.608 --> 04:17.608
 Yes!

04:17.608 --> 04:18.608
 Wow!

04:18.608 --> 04:19.608
 Wow!

04:19.608 --> 04:20.608
 Wow!

04:20.608 --> 04:21.608
 Wow!

04:21.608 --> 04:22.608
 Wow!

04:22.608 --> 04:23.608
 Watch out!

04:23.608 --> 04:24.608
 Watch out!

04:24.608 --> 04:25.608
 Watch out!

04:25.608 --> 04:26.608
 I'm sorry.

04:26.608 --> 04:28.608
 Did you pay the fee?

04:29.608 --> 04:30.608
 Yes!

04:30.608 --> 04:33.608
 Next, I'll imitate your posture.

04:33.608 --> 04:34.608
 I see.

04:34.608 --> 04:36.608
 Karen, you were standing like this.

04:36.608 --> 04:37.608
 Yes!

04:37.608 --> 04:39.608
 I'll imitate your posture.

04:39.608 --> 04:40.608
 Are you ready?

04:40.608 --> 04:41.608
 Do it at the same time.

04:41.608 --> 04:42.608
 Ready?

04:42.608 --> 04:43.608
 Peeing!

04:44.608 --> 04:45.608
 Ready?

04:45.608 --> 04:46.608
 Peeing!

04:46.608 --> 04:47.608
 Do it more.

04:47.608 --> 04:48.608
 Ready?

04:48.608 --> 04:49.608
 Peeing!

04:49.608 --> 04:50.608
 Peeing!

04:50.608 --> 04:51.608
 Do it more.

04:51.608 --> 04:52.608
 Ready?

04:52.608 --> 04:53.608
 Peeing!

04:53.608 --> 04:54.608
 OK!

04:54.608 --> 04:55.608
 I'm watching you.

04:55.608 --> 04:56.608
 I'm watching you.

04:56.608 --> 04:57.608
 I'm watching you.

04:59.608 --> 05:04.608
 Next, we have to get along with
bicycles.

05:04.608 --> 05:06.608
 We have to get along with them.

05:06.608 --> 05:07.608
 Yes, we do.

05:07.608 --> 05:09.608
 In order to get along with bicycles,

05:09.608 --> 05:11.608
 let's introduce ourselves.

05:11.608 --> 05:12.608
 I see.

05:12.608 --> 05:14.608
 How should we introduce ourselves?

05:14.608 --> 05:16.608
 First, your profile.

05:16.608 --> 05:20.608
 Name, age, birthplace, age, birthplace,
and where you were born.

05:20.608 --> 05:21.608
 And your recommendation in Tohoku.

05:21.608 --> 05:22.608
 I see.

05:22.608 --> 05:25.608
 And what kind of person you want to be
in the future.

05:25.608 --> 05:27.608
 And what kind of relationship you want
to have with bicycles.

05:27.608 --> 05:28.608
 I see.

05:28.608 --> 05:29.608
 You have a lot of things to say.

05:29.608 --> 05:30.608
 And your worries.

05:30.608 --> 05:31.608
 I see.

05:32.608 --> 05:33.608
 Let's start with your profile.

05:33.608 --> 05:34.608
 Yes.

05:34.608 --> 05:36.768
 Thank you for watching this video.

05:36.768 --> 05:40.768
 I'm 18 years old, from Miyagi
prefecture.

05:40.768 --> 05:43.768
 The sparrows of Tohoku are the eggs of
the duckweed.

05:43.768 --> 05:52.768
 I want to be in a relationship where
people support each other, regardless of
their origin.

05:52.768 --> 06:01.768
 I think that bicycles are a very easy
and familiar existence among the means
of transportation.

06:01.768 --> 06:06.768
 I want to be loved by everyone as an
idol.

06:06.768 --> 06:09.768
 What are your recent worries?

06:09.768 --> 06:15.768
 I'm worried about how to live as a
leader.

06:15.768 --> 06:16.768
 I want you to tell me.

06:16.768 --> 06:18.768
 It's heavy.

06:18.768 --> 06:25.768
 I think I can accept bicycles because
I've revealed myself.

06:25.768 --> 06:28.768
 I think you can understand the feeling
of the tire.

06:28.768 --> 06:31.768
 I want to massage the tire.

06:31.768 --> 06:33.768
 Do you want to do it?

06:33.768 --> 06:35.768
 The tire may be a little hard.

06:35.768 --> 06:37.768
 I'm going.

06:37.768 --> 06:39.768
 It's hard.

06:39.768 --> 06:41.768
 It's not hard.

06:41.768 --> 06:43.768
 The air is in the tire.

06:43.768 --> 06:45.768
 It's hard.

06:45.768 --> 06:46.768
 It's hard.

06:46.768 --> 06:47.768
 It's very hard.

06:51.768 --> 06:53.768
 It's good.

06:53.768 --> 06:54.768
 It's getting loose.

06:54.768 --> 06:56.768
 It's good.

06:56.768 --> 07:00.768
 I think I've connected with the
bicycle.

07:00.768 --> 07:01.768
 I think so, too.

07:01.768 --> 07:03.768
 I can know my partner and reveal
myself.

07:03.768 --> 07:04.768
 I like your face color.

07:04.768 --> 07:06.768
 I like your face color.

07:06.768 --> 07:09.768
 Shall we ride on the bicycle?

07:09.768 --> 07:10.768
 Yes.

07:10.768 --> 07:11.768
 Let's ride on the bicycle.

07:11.768 --> 07:18.768
 You should put your feet on the pedal.

07:18.768 --> 07:20.768
 Yes.

07:22.768 --> 07:24.768
 Look at the back of the bicycle.

07:24.768 --> 07:25.768
 Yes.

07:25.768 --> 07:26.768
 Look at the front of the bicycle.

07:26.768 --> 07:28.768
 I think I'm looking at the front of the
bicycle too much.

07:28.768 --> 07:31.768
 You should put your feet on the pedal.

07:31.768 --> 07:33.768
 You should put your feet on the pedal
as much as you can.

07:33.768 --> 07:34.768
 Yes.

07:34.768 --> 07:35.768
 Let's go.

07:35.768 --> 07:36.768
 Yes.

07:36.768 --> 07:37.768
 Ready, go!

07:40.768 --> 07:41.768
 Stop.

07:41.768 --> 07:45.768
 The direction of the bicycle changes.

07:45.768 --> 07:46.768
 I see.

07:46.768 --> 07:48.768
 I see.

07:48.768 --> 07:50.768
 Let's go again.

07:50.768 --> 07:51.768
 Yes.

07:53.768 --> 07:54.768
 Slowly.

07:54.768 --> 07:57.232
 Yes.

07:58.232 --> 07:59.232
 Wow.

08:00.232 --> 08:01.232
 Wow.

08:02.232 --> 08:03.232
 It's right. Yes.

08:04.232 --> 08:06.232
 Oh, my body is twisted.

08:07.232 --> 08:08.232
 Like this?

08:09.232 --> 08:10.232
 Let's try it again.

08:11.232 --> 08:13.232
 Can you show me how to ride it? Sure.

08:17.232 --> 08:18.232
 Let me go.

08:20.232 --> 08:21.232
 Let's go.

08:21.232 --> 08:23.232
 Go! Wow.

08:33.754 --> 08:35.754
 I'm watching you.

08:35.754 --> 08:37.754
 I'm watching you.

08:37.754 --> 08:39.754
 I'm watching you.

08:41.754 --> 08:43.754
 I see.

08:43.754 --> 08:45.754
 I think I can do it.

08:45.754 --> 08:47.754
 I feel like I'm elegant.

08:47.754 --> 08:49.754
 I see.

08:49.754 --> 09:03.754
 Please subscribe to my channel.

09:04.026 --> 09:06.026
 The pedal is always bent.

09:06.026 --> 09:07.026
 I see.

09:07.026 --> 09:08.026
 It stops.

09:08.026 --> 09:10.026
 Yes, it stops.

09:13.026 --> 09:16.026
 Let's go as you see.

09:17.026 --> 09:18.026
 Ready, go!

09:18.026 --> 09:20.768
 Please subscribe to this channel!

09:21.768 --> 09:23.768
 I can do it!

09:23.768 --> 09:24.768
 I can do it!

09:24.768 --> 09:25.768
 I can do it!

09:25.768 --> 09:26.768
 I can do it!

09:26.768 --> 09:27.768
 I can do it!

09:27.768 --> 09:28.768
 I can do it!

09:28.768 --> 09:30.768
 I have entered the camera.

09:37.768 --> 09:38.768
 Are you OK?

09:39.768 --> 09:40.768
 Are you OK?

09:41.768 --> 09:42.768
 Are you OK?

09:43.768 --> 09:45.768
 I have never seen this kind of movement
in animation.

09:45.768 --> 09:46.768
 It was amazing.

09:46.768 --> 09:47.768
 Look forward!

09:47.768 --> 09:48.768
 OK!

09:48.768 --> 09:49.768
 Look forward!

09:49.768 --> 09:50.768
 OK!

09:50.768 --> 09:52.768
 Move your hands along the path.

09:52.768 --> 09:53.768
 OK!

09:53.768 --> 09:54.768
 Look far!

09:54.768 --> 09:55.768
 OK!

09:55.768 --> 09:56.768
 It is the same as Mario Kart.

09:56.768 --> 09:57.768
 I see.

09:57.768 --> 09:58.768
 It is slanted.

09:58.768 --> 10:05.946
 Please subscribe to this channel!

10:05.946 --> 10:07.946
 Oh!

10:07.946 --> 10:09.946
 Oh!

10:09.946 --> 10:11.946
 It's OK!

10:11.946 --> 10:13.946
 Look at the distance!

10:13.946 --> 10:15.946
 OK!

10:15.946 --> 10:17.946
 Oh!

10:17.946 --> 10:19.946
 Mi-kun, try to release it!

10:23.946 --> 10:25.946
 You can do it!

10:25.946 --> 10:27.946
 You can control it by yourself!

10:29.946 --> 10:31.946
 Let's go to the edge!

10:31.946 --> 10:33.178
 Oh!

10:33.178 --> 10:35.178
 I'm not pushing the button.

10:35.178 --> 10:36.178
 Really?

10:36.178 --> 10:38.178
 Let's push it harder.

10:38.178 --> 10:39.178
 OK.

10:39.178 --> 10:40.178
 It's more stable.

10:43.178 --> 10:44.178
 Let go of Miya.

10:47.178 --> 10:48.178
 Stop.

10:55.178 --> 10:56.178
 You're great.

10:56.178 --> 10:57.178
 Great.

10:57.178 --> 10:59.178
 I'm not pushing the button.

10:59.178 --> 11:00.672
 Wow!

11:01.672 --> 11:03.672
 If you go by yourself from the
beginning, you can't do it.

11:03.672 --> 11:04.672
 Let me go.

11:04.672 --> 11:05.672
 Like this.

11:05.672 --> 11:06.672
 OK.

11:06.672 --> 11:07.672
 I'll be like this.

11:07.672 --> 11:13.672
 So, I'll go like this, as if I'm
controlling the bicycle.

11:14.672 --> 11:15.672
 I'll do what you said.

11:15.672 --> 11:16.672
 I'll ride it.

11:16.672 --> 11:17.672
 Let's go to the middle.

11:17.672 --> 11:18.672
 Thank you.

11:18.672 --> 11:22.384
 I'll go.

11:23.384 --> 11:24.384
 Yes!

11:27.384 --> 11:28.384
 Awesome!

11:31.384 --> 11:32.384
 Watch out!

11:33.384 --> 11:34.384
 Yes!

11:38.384 --> 11:39.384
 You're doing great!

11:40.384 --> 11:41.384
 Stop!

11:43.384 --> 11:44.384
 Awesome!

11:45.384 --> 11:46.384
 You did it!

11:46.384 --> 11:47.384
 Awesome!

11:49.384 --> 11:50.384
 I did it!

11:51.384 --> 11:52.384
 You're great, Kohko!

11:53.384 --> 11:54.384
 You have potential.

11:55.384 --> 11:57.384
 Thank you for teaching me.

11:58.384 --> 12:00.384
 I didn't expect you to do it so
quickly.

12:01.384 --> 12:02.384
 I was surprised.

12:02.384 --> 12:05.384
 It's a story of a sudden success.

12:05.384 --> 12:07.384
 It's a touching story.

12:08.384 --> 12:09.384
 I was surprised.

12:09.384 --> 12:12.384
 It's the most valuable video I've ever
seen.

12:12.384 --> 12:13.384
 It's amazing!

12:13.384 --> 12:14.384
 Awesome!

12:15.384 --> 12:16.384
 Awesome!

12:16.384 --> 12:18.384
 It's a touching BGM.

12:19.384 --> 12:20.384
 Thank you.

12:20.384 --> 12:21.384
 I did it!

12:21.384 --> 12:22.384
 I'm glad.

12:23.384 --> 12:26.384
 I can ride a bicycle even if I have to
direct it.

12:26.384 --> 12:27.384
 I can ride it.

12:27.384 --> 12:29.384
 Can you ride a bicycle in Shinjuku?

12:29.384 --> 12:30.384
 No.

12:30.384 --> 12:31.384
 I can't.

12:31.384 --> 12:33.384
 Then, I'll ride a bicycle with you.

12:33.384 --> 12:37.384
 I think you could ride a bicycle
because you weren't afraid.

12:37.384 --> 12:39.384
 You can't ride a bicycle if you're
afraid.

12:39.384 --> 12:40.384
 I felt good.

12:40.384 --> 12:41.384
 The wind was blowing.

12:41.384 --> 12:43.384
 It's fun.

12:45.384 --> 12:48.384
 Next time, we'll have a story of a
sudden success.

12:48.384 --> 12:51.384
 Finally, nine of us will ride a
bicycle.

12:51.384 --> 12:53.384
 I want to ride a bicycle.

12:53.384 --> 12:54.384
 I want to ride a bicycle.

12:54.384 --> 12:56.384
 We'll sing a song while riding a
bicycle.

12:56.384 --> 12:57.384
 Singing?

12:57.384 --> 12:58.384
 I'm a little dizzy.

12:59.384 --> 13:00.384
 You made us cry.

13:00.384 --> 13:01.384
 Really?

13:01.384 --> 13:02.384
 You made us cry.

13:02.384 --> 13:03.384
 There are other stories.

13:03.384 --> 13:05.384
 I'm afraid I'll get a pain.

13:05.384 --> 13:06.384
 I'm embarrassed.

13:07.384 --> 13:10.384
 It was a story of a sudden success.

13:10.384 --> 13:12.384
 I'm glad to hear that.

13:16.384 --> 13:22.384
 If you can't ride a bicycle, please
watch this video and learn how to ride a
bicycle.

13:22.384 --> 13:27.384
 If you have any trouble, please look up
how to ride a bicycle in Tohoku.

13:27.384 --> 13:31.384
 If you're in trouble, please look it
up.

13:31.384 --> 13:32.384
 Thank you very much.

13:32.384 --> 13:33.384
 Congratulations.

13:33.384 --> 13:34.384
 Thank you.

13:34.384 --> 13:35.384
 Thank you.

13:35.384 --> 13:36.384
 I'm glad.

13:36.384 --> 13:39.384
 Please try to ride a bicycle.

13:39.384 --> 13:45.440

13:46.440 --> 13:48.440

 Go!

13:51.440 --> 14:06.440
 Wow!

14:09.338 --> 14:11.338
 Bye bye!
