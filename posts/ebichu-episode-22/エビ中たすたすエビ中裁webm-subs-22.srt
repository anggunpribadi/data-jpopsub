1
00:00:00,122 --> 00:00:04,122
Ebichu Tastas has started

2
00:00:06,122 --> 00:00:10,122
Ebichu Tastas is going to be a trial for
Ebichu Tastas

3
00:00:10,122 --> 00:00:11,122
Then...

4
00:00:11,122 --> 00:00:13,122
It's a trial

5
00:00:13,122 --> 00:00:14,122
It's a trial

6
00:00:14,122 --> 00:00:16,122
What kind of trial is this?

7
00:00:16,122 --> 00:00:19,122
All the crimes of Ebichu are being
punished

8
00:00:20,122 --> 00:00:22,122
Is it guilty or innocent?

9
00:00:22,122 --> 00:00:25,122
Tonight's verdict will be given

10
00:00:25,122 --> 00:00:30,122
What's more, Matsuno is in tears

11
00:00:30,122 --> 00:00:34,122
I'm very negative about the criminal

12
00:00:34,122 --> 00:00:38,122
Ebichu Tastas has started

13
00:00:38,122 --> 00:00:42,122
It's a trial

14
00:00:42,122 --> 00:00:46,122
Ebichu Tastas has finished

15
00:00:46,122 --> 00:00:47,354
Ebichu Tastas has finished

16
00:01:17,354 --> 00:01:20,354
The 4th discussion

17
00:01:27,354 --> 00:01:29,354
Available in all the roasted seaweed
stores

18
00:01:29,354 --> 00:01:32,354
etc.

19
00:01:32,654 --> 00:01:35,354
The Privacy M intolerance

20
00:01:35,354 --> 00:01:38,354
Sponsored by the following sponsors

21
00:01:42,354 --> 00:01:44,354
It's an unexpected development

22
00:01:44,354 --> 00:01:46,354
What is this development?

23
00:01:47,354 --> 00:01:50,354
Ebichu Tastas has begun

24
00:01:52,354 --> 00:01:56,354
I will be the host today

25
00:01:56,354 --> 00:01:58,354
This time Hoshina

26
00:01:58,354 --> 00:01:59,354
Is it the second time?

27
00:01:59,354 --> 00:02:01,354
Next time after college

28
00:02:01,354 --> 00:02:03,354
I was told that at college

29
00:02:03,354 --> 00:02:06,354
I am the star of the shooting star,
Takiue

30
00:02:06,354 --> 00:02:07,354
I am Chuue

31
00:02:17,354 --> 00:02:18,354
It's long

32
00:02:18,354 --> 00:02:20,354
I don't know the ending

33
00:02:20,354 --> 00:02:23,354
Hoshina, what is the theme this time?

34
00:02:23,354 --> 00:02:27,354
This time, we will be in Ebichu

35
00:02:27,354 --> 00:02:29,354
It's a trial

36
00:02:29,354 --> 00:02:32,354
But when it comes to trials

37
00:02:32,354 --> 00:02:34,354
Everyone will be accused

38
00:02:34,354 --> 00:02:36,354
Was there an incident?

39
00:02:36,354 --> 00:02:39,354
Hoshina, do you have anything to say?

40
00:02:39,354 --> 00:02:40,354
Just now

41
00:02:40,354 --> 00:02:41,354
Just now?

42
00:02:41,354 --> 00:02:43,354
That's good

43
00:02:43,354 --> 00:02:45,354
I called my mom

44
00:02:45,354 --> 00:02:47,354
We all go to the hotel

45
00:02:47,354 --> 00:02:50,354
I asked her what to do with the bag

46
00:02:50,354 --> 00:02:52,354
Riku said it was dangerous

47
00:02:52,354 --> 00:02:54,354
I said something different is good

48
00:02:54,354 --> 00:02:56,354
She was really angry

49
00:02:56,354 --> 00:02:58,354
What?

50
00:02:58,354 --> 00:03:00,354
Nothing interesting

51
00:03:00,354 --> 00:03:02,354
I don't know what it is

52
00:03:02,354 --> 00:03:04,354
I don't know if it's dangerous

53
00:03:04,354 --> 00:03:08,354
Before that, everyone will explain

54
00:03:08,354 --> 00:03:11,354
Let's start

55
00:03:11,354 --> 00:03:13,354
It's a trial

56
00:03:13,354 --> 00:03:15,354
Everyone, it's a trial

57
00:03:15,354 --> 00:03:17,354
It's a trial

58
00:03:18,354 --> 00:03:19,354
I'm scared

59
00:03:19,354 --> 00:03:21,354
It's in the middle of the show

60
00:03:21,354 --> 00:03:24,354
It's a trial

61
00:03:24,354 --> 00:03:28,354
Even so, you should have come in earlier

62
00:03:28,962 --> 00:03:32,982
Would you use the kind of way to
surprise them?

63
00:03:33,482 --> 00:03:36,422
Sorry, more like violence.

64
00:03:42,474 --> 00:03:46,614
now we like to proceed with the тоже-
Land Viewet

65
00:03:48,694 --> 00:03:49,954
okay, Everyone

66
00:03:49,954 --> 00:03:52,114
now that I've become a Lawyer

67
00:03:52,774 --> 00:03:55,574
that you're going to listen to all of me

68
00:03:55,854 --> 00:03:59,354
i'll prove that you are not an article

69
00:03:59,594 --> 00:04:01,274
okay, then

70
00:04:01,274 --> 00:04:03,034
i'll bemann you if yourying me

71
00:04:05,314 --> 00:04:06,134
one more thing

72
00:04:06,134 --> 00:04:08,554
you should check your curriculum

73
00:04:08,554 --> 00:04:10,554
I'm not.

74
00:04:10,554 --> 00:04:16,554
In this TASTAS trial, the prosecutor is
the prosecutor and the defendant is the
defendant.

75
00:04:16,554 --> 00:04:20,554
The members are divided into multiple
groups and the defendant is the
defendant.

76
00:04:20,554 --> 00:04:23,934
The judge's

77
00:04:25,554 --> 00:04:30,554
Then, TASTAS trial, start!

78
00:04:32,554 --> 00:04:34,554
First, this!

79
00:04:34,554 --> 00:04:38,554
An impersonation of a character that
doesn't look like her.

80
00:04:38,554 --> 00:04:40,554
I know who it is.

81
00:04:40,554 --> 00:04:41,554
You know?

82
00:04:41,554 --> 00:04:42,554
I know.

83
00:04:42,554 --> 00:04:44,554
Who is this?

84
00:04:44,554 --> 00:04:47,554
Hiroto? Who do you think it is? Tell me.

85
00:04:47,554 --> 00:04:48,554
It's Hoshina-san.

86
00:04:48,554 --> 00:04:50,554
Is it Hoshina-san?

87
00:04:50,554 --> 00:04:52,554
Isn't it because she's been called
similar recently?

88
00:04:52,554 --> 00:04:54,554
I understand that she's been called
similar recently.

89
00:04:54,554 --> 00:04:57,554
First, the defendant, Hoshina Mirei,
please come forward.

90
00:04:57,554 --> 00:04:59,554
Why?

91
00:04:59,554 --> 00:05:00,554
Bye-bye.

92
00:05:00,554 --> 00:05:02,554
I think it's already this way.

93
00:05:02,554 --> 00:05:04,442
I'm sorry.

94
00:05:04,442 --> 00:05:10,442
Hoshina's impression of the impersonator
is judged

95
00:05:11,442 --> 00:05:15,442
Then, Kenji Takeue, please read the
basic information

96
00:05:15,442 --> 00:05:21,442
Hoshina Mirei is not like the
impersonator at all, but she is full of
confidence and shows her impersonation

97
00:05:21,442 --> 00:05:24,442
She confuses the people around her

98
00:05:24,442 --> 00:05:27,442
So she is based on impersonator that is
not like the impersonator

99
00:05:27,442 --> 00:05:32,442
By the way, there are also some
merchants

100
00:05:32,442 --> 00:05:36,442
Among 7 of the shrimp, 4 people are
impersonators

101
00:05:38,442 --> 00:05:40,442
I want to be the first one

102
00:05:40,442 --> 00:05:42,442
Kenji Takeu

103
00:05:42,442 --> 00:05:43,442
I want to be the first one

104
00:05:43,442 --> 00:05:46,442
Let's do the trial of that hair later

105
00:05:47,442 --> 00:05:50,442
Kenji Takeue's trial is a bit later

106
00:05:50,442 --> 00:05:54,442
Matsuno is trying to prove that she is
confused by Hoshina's impersonation

107
00:05:54,442 --> 00:06:04,442
Mirei often does impersonations of crows
and Rola

108
00:06:04,442 --> 00:06:08,442
She is not like the impersonator at all,
so I don't know how to react

109
00:06:08,442 --> 00:06:11,442
I see, you don't know

110
00:06:11,442 --> 00:06:17,442
Mirei, what are you doing?

111
00:06:18,442 --> 00:06:21,442
Is there any meaning in this statement?

112
00:06:21,442 --> 00:06:25,442
I don't want to be the impersonator that
is like the impersonator

113
00:06:25,442 --> 00:06:27,442
Please listen to me

114
00:06:27,442 --> 00:06:28,442
I will listen to you

115
00:06:28,442 --> 00:06:31,442
I always hear that you are like the
impersonator

116
00:06:31,442 --> 00:06:35,442
I think it is necessary to be like the
impersonator

117
00:06:35,442 --> 00:06:36,442
That's right

118
00:06:36,442 --> 00:06:42,442
I think it is necessary to be like the
impersonator

119
00:06:42,442 --> 00:06:43,442
That's right

120
00:06:43,442 --> 00:06:51,442
Let's do the impersonation

121
00:06:51,442 --> 00:06:58,442
Kenji Takeu is trying to prove that she
is confused by Hoshina's impersonation

122
00:07:00,442 --> 00:07:06,442
Rola, please do the impersonation of
Rola

123
00:07:06,442 --> 00:07:11,442
Rola, I want your hairstyle today too

124
00:07:11,442 --> 00:07:13,442
Thank you

125
00:07:13,442 --> 00:07:15,442
Like this

126
00:07:15,442 --> 00:07:18,442
I thought it was similar

127
00:07:18,442 --> 00:07:23,442
Do you come to this place?

128
00:07:23,442 --> 00:07:25,442
Please sit down

129
00:07:25,442 --> 00:07:28,442
How was it, Kenji?

130
00:07:28,442 --> 00:07:33,442
I thought it was not similar at all, but
it was a bit similar

131
00:07:33,442 --> 00:07:35,302
It was similar

132
00:07:35,302 --> 00:07:37,302
Just a little bit.

133
00:07:37,302 --> 00:07:40,302
But I think this is too average.

134
00:07:40,302 --> 00:07:46,302
By the way, this average imitation is
the most difficult to watch.

135
00:07:46,302 --> 00:07:48,302
That's right.

136
00:07:48,302 --> 00:07:50,302
Then I'll do something very similar.

137
00:07:50,302 --> 00:07:52,302
Another one?

138
00:07:52,302 --> 00:07:53,302
Park!

139
00:07:53,302 --> 00:07:57,302
Park? Then please show me that.

140
00:07:59,302 --> 00:08:02,302
The judge is a star with a high voice.

141
00:08:02,302 --> 00:08:05,302
Did you really study watching YouTube?

142
00:08:05,302 --> 00:08:07,302
Did you study watching YouTube?

143
00:08:07,302 --> 00:08:10,302
There should be other witnesses.

144
00:08:10,302 --> 00:08:11,302
Certainly.

145
00:08:11,302 --> 00:08:13,302
Another person who suffered damage.

146
00:08:13,302 --> 00:08:15,302
Yasumoto-san.

147
00:08:15,302 --> 00:08:19,302
Next, Yasumoto Ayaka's testimony.

148
00:08:20,302 --> 00:08:24,302
Hoshira-san, isn't this very average?

149
00:08:24,302 --> 00:08:30,302
When I first imitated Rola-san, I
honestly thought it wasn't similar.

150
00:08:30,302 --> 00:08:32,302
Please sit down!

151
00:08:32,302 --> 00:08:34,302
Please sit down!

152
00:08:34,302 --> 00:08:36,302
What are you doing?

153
00:08:36,302 --> 00:08:38,302
The witness is still talking.

154
00:08:38,302 --> 00:08:40,302
I thought it wasn't similar.

155
00:08:40,302 --> 00:08:44,302
But I thought if I said it, I would hurt
her.

156
00:08:44,302 --> 00:08:46,302
The people around me haven't said it
yet.

157
00:08:46,302 --> 00:08:48,302
So I thought I shouldn't say it's not
similar.

158
00:08:48,302 --> 00:08:50,302
I thought it was okay to say it.

159
00:08:50,302 --> 00:08:52,302
This is frustrating.

160
00:08:52,302 --> 00:08:56,302
I was beaten by Hoshira-san.

161
00:08:56,302 --> 00:08:58,302
I see.

162
00:08:58,302 --> 00:09:00,302
The witness is in a panic.

163
00:09:00,302 --> 00:09:02,302
She can't speak Japanese.

164
00:09:02,302 --> 00:09:04,302
But I think she can feel it.

165
00:09:04,302 --> 00:09:05,302
I see.

166
00:09:05,302 --> 00:09:06,302
I was so surprised.

167
00:09:06,302 --> 00:09:08,302
I didn't know if I should say it or not.

168
00:09:08,302 --> 00:09:12,302
Please go back to the witness.

169
00:09:12,302 --> 00:09:15,302
Have you seen any other impersonation?

170
00:09:15,302 --> 00:09:16,302
Hoshira-san?

171
00:09:16,302 --> 00:09:17,302
No.

172
00:09:17,302 --> 00:09:19,302
How can you do it?

173
00:09:19,302 --> 00:09:21,302
She can do anything.

174
00:09:21,302 --> 00:09:24,302
But she can't be Hoshira-san.

175
00:09:24,302 --> 00:09:25,302
I see.

176
00:09:25,302 --> 00:09:26,302
I love you.

177
00:09:26,302 --> 00:09:28,302
I love you.

178
00:09:28,302 --> 00:09:30,302
I love you.

179
00:09:30,302 --> 00:09:31,302
I see.

180
00:09:31,302 --> 00:09:35,302
Hoshina says she can do anything.

181
00:09:35,302 --> 00:09:38,302
She tried to hit Sazae-san.

182
00:09:38,302 --> 00:09:40,302
Sazae-san.

183
00:09:40,302 --> 00:09:41,302
I'm Sazae.

184
00:09:41,302 --> 00:09:43,302
Isn't it Hoshina-san?

185
00:09:43,302 --> 00:09:44,302
It's not just Hoshina-san.

186
00:09:44,302 --> 00:09:46,302
Where is Sazae-san?

187
00:09:46,302 --> 00:09:48,302
This is a mental pain.

188
00:09:48,302 --> 00:09:50,302
What is the line you just said?

189
00:09:50,302 --> 00:09:52,302
The line is Hoshina.

190
00:09:52,302 --> 00:09:54,302
It's okay.

191
00:09:54,302 --> 00:09:57,302
Next, she imitates.

192
00:09:58,302 --> 00:10:00,302
Please say, Carrie Pamyu Pamyu.

193
00:10:01,302 --> 00:10:03,302
I'm Carrie Pamyu Pamyu.

194
00:10:03,302 --> 00:10:05,302
Thank you.

195
00:10:05,302 --> 00:10:06,302
I'm Tenpatsu.

196
00:10:06,302 --> 00:10:08,302
Did you hear that?

197
00:10:08,302 --> 00:10:09,302
I'm Tenpatsu.

198
00:10:09,302 --> 00:10:11,302
Carrie Tenpatsu is so terrible.

199
00:10:11,302 --> 00:10:13,658
This is terrible.

200
00:10:13,658 --> 00:10:15,658
I just said I like you and shake hands
with you.

201
00:10:15,658 --> 00:10:17,658
I don't know.

202
00:10:17,658 --> 00:10:19,658
What are you saying?

203
00:10:19,658 --> 00:10:25,658
And then, she imitates Takeshi B and
Takeshi.

204
00:10:25,658 --> 00:10:36,658
What are you doing, Nahata?

205
00:10:36,658 --> 00:10:39,386
Oh, not you.

206
00:10:39,386 --> 00:10:42,386
That's a new pattern, Takeshi-san

207
00:10:43,386 --> 00:10:45,386
Now, the final decision

208
00:10:45,386 --> 00:10:49,386
Is Hoshina Hikoku guilty or innocent?

209
00:10:50,386 --> 00:10:52,386
Please show us your answers

210
00:10:52,386 --> 00:10:53,386
Go!

211
00:10:59,386 --> 00:11:00,386
It's the same

212
00:11:00,386 --> 00:11:03,386
Guilty 7, innocent 0

213
00:11:03,386 --> 00:11:09,386
So Hoshina Hikoku will be guilty

214
00:11:12,386 --> 00:11:14,386
Hoshina Hikoku will be

215
00:11:14,386 --> 00:11:19,386
Only be considered as a good role model
for Takeshi Beat

216
00:11:21,386 --> 00:11:24,386
Takeshi Beat, how do you feel now?

217
00:11:25,386 --> 00:11:28,386
I'm happy that I can do it

218
00:11:28,386 --> 00:11:33,386
I'm happy that I can do it

219
00:11:33,386 --> 00:11:36,386
The next basic case is

220
00:11:36,386 --> 00:11:38,386
Lose and avoid

221
00:11:40,386 --> 00:11:33,006
After this, Matsuno will appear in the

222
00:11:44,386 --> 00:11:47,386
Takiue Kenji's strict pursuit

223
00:11:48,386 --> 00:11:51,386
I'm quite negative

224
00:11:52,386 --> 00:11:55,386
Will he confess his innocence with
tears?

225
00:11:55,386 --> 00:11:58,386
Before that

226
00:11:58,386 --> 00:12:03,386
We'll show you the unreleased footage of
the last episode

227
00:12:04,386 --> 00:12:07,386
Inside the car heading to Niigata

228
00:12:07,386 --> 00:12:12,386
We're also with Ebichu

229
00:12:13,386 --> 00:12:17,386
Ebichu and Aru Aru are having a talk

230
00:12:18,386 --> 00:12:21,386
Mayama is not high tension

231
00:12:21,386 --> 00:12:23,386
Ebichu and Aru Aru

232
00:12:23,386 --> 00:12:27,386
Mayama used to be high tension

233
00:12:27,386 --> 00:12:30,386
But now he's a big sister

234
00:12:30,386 --> 00:12:32,386
He's serious

235
00:12:32,386 --> 00:12:36,386
The most exciting part is Mayama's catch
phrase

236
00:12:36,386 --> 00:12:38,386
Furthermore

237
00:12:38,386 --> 00:12:43,386
I think Mayama has a better catch phrase

238
00:12:45,386 --> 00:12:48,386
We'll think about it

239
00:12:48,386 --> 00:12:53,386
Mayama's catch phrase

240
00:12:53,386 --> 00:12:58,386
First, Mayama's catch phrase

241
00:13:01,386 --> 00:13:03,386
Go to the center

242
00:13:03,386 --> 00:13:05,386
Queen of the royal road

243
00:13:05,386 --> 00:13:12,930
Mayama's catch phrase

244
00:13:12,930 --> 00:13:13,930
Go somewhere!

245
00:13:14,530 --> 00:13:15,530
A roadside village!

246
00:13:17,050 --> 00:13:20,650
It doesn't sound like an idol at all, it
sounds like a roadside village

247
00:13:21,490 --> 00:13:26,250
Next, what is Mayama's new catchphrase
that Ju-e thought of?

248
00:13:26,810 --> 00:13:27,810
Do you like anime?

249
00:13:27,810 --> 00:13:29,930
Yes, that's right, Mayama

250
00:13:30,650 --> 00:13:36,090
Kama-yama-ya!

251
00:13:36,690 --> 00:13:37,690
What do you mean?

252
00:13:37,690 --> 00:13:39,194
What do you mean?

253
00:13:39,194 --> 00:13:41,194
I liked Dragon Ball

254
00:13:41,194 --> 00:13:44,194
It's not like the first half of the
anime

255
00:13:44,194 --> 00:13:45,194
It's still there

256
00:13:45,194 --> 00:13:47,194
The youngest

257
00:13:47,194 --> 00:13:41,194
You're being a little bit

258
00:13:51,194 --> 00:13:53,194
The last one is Takiyue Koan

259
00:13:53,194 --> 00:13:55,194
Mayama's new catchphrase

260
00:13:56,194 --> 00:13:58,194
I think it's pretty good

261
00:13:58,194 --> 00:13:59,194
I'll go

262
00:13:59,194 --> 00:14:01,194
I said it before but I like anime

263
00:14:01,194 --> 00:14:02,194
This one

264
00:14:02,194 --> 00:14:03,194
I like Nijigen

265
00:14:03,194 --> 00:14:06,194
Animation girl in Ebichu

266
00:14:06,194 --> 00:14:08,194
How is it?

267
00:14:08,194 --> 00:14:10,194
I like Nijigen

268
00:14:10,194 --> 00:14:12,194
I like Ebichu's animation

269
00:14:12,194 --> 00:14:14,194
Mayama is a third dimension

270
00:14:14,194 --> 00:14:16,194
Isn't it?

271
00:14:16,194 --> 00:14:18,194
I like anime

272
00:14:18,194 --> 00:14:20,194
I know

273
00:14:20,194 --> 00:14:22,194
I'm glad you said that

274
00:14:22,194 --> 00:14:23,194
It's true

275
00:14:24,194 --> 00:14:29,194
So the three of them thought of Mayama's
new catchphrase is

276
00:14:31,194 --> 00:14:34,194
After that, the three of them met Ebichu

277
00:14:34,194 --> 00:14:38,194
They suggested to Mayama

278
00:14:40,194 --> 00:14:43,194
Mayama is not a high tension girl

279
00:14:43,194 --> 00:14:45,194
I know

280
00:14:45,194 --> 00:14:46,194
I know

281
00:14:46,194 --> 00:14:49,194
This is my high tension

282
00:14:49,194 --> 00:14:51,194
It's low now

283
00:14:51,194 --> 00:14:52,194
It's low

284
00:14:52,194 --> 00:14:56,194
I have many experiences of why I became
like this

285
00:14:56,194 --> 00:14:59,194
I used to be like Kobayashi

286
00:14:59,194 --> 00:15:01,194
You can be like this

287
00:15:01,194 --> 00:15:03,194
I'm not like that

288
00:15:03,194 --> 00:15:05,194
Don't say like a grandma

289
00:15:05,194 --> 00:15:09,194
Mayama is busy with live show

290
00:15:09,194 --> 00:15:12,194
She gave her new catchphrase

291
00:15:12,194 --> 00:15:14,194
I'll go

292
00:15:14,194 --> 00:15:16,194
Don't be high tension

293
00:15:16,194 --> 00:15:21,194
Ka ma ya ma ya

294
00:15:27,194 --> 00:15:28,154
So fast

295
00:15:28,154 --> 00:15:30,154
I don't know what it means

296
00:15:30,154 --> 00:15:31,154
That's right

297
00:15:31,154 --> 00:15:32,154
Then

298
00:15:32,154 --> 00:15:34,154
I'll write it down

299
00:15:34,154 --> 00:15:36,154
I'll write this

300
00:15:36,154 --> 00:15:38,154
Go to the center

301
00:15:38,154 --> 00:15:40,154
Queen of the royal road

302
00:15:40,154 --> 00:15:42,154
What does it mean?

303
00:15:42,154 --> 00:15:44,154
Let's go next

304
00:15:44,154 --> 00:15:46,154
It was good

305
00:15:46,154 --> 00:15:48,154
Next

306
00:15:48,154 --> 00:15:52,154
And the last one is Takiue who is full
of confidence

307
00:15:52,154 --> 00:15:54,154
I like anime

308
00:15:54,154 --> 00:15:56,154
I'll go

309
00:15:56,154 --> 00:15:58,154
I like 2D anime

310
00:15:58,154 --> 00:16:00,154
Ebichu's animation girl

311
00:16:00,154 --> 00:16:02,154
How is it?

312
00:16:02,154 --> 00:16:04,154
Yasumoto's face

313
00:16:04,154 --> 00:16:06,154
I didn't get it

314
00:16:06,154 --> 00:16:08,154
I should have said it first

315
00:16:08,154 --> 00:16:10,154
I think I like this one

316
00:16:10,154 --> 00:16:12,154
I like Asaka

317
00:16:12,154 --> 00:16:14,154
I'll use it later

318
00:16:14,154 --> 00:16:16,154
Okay

319
00:16:16,154 --> 00:16:22,154
They will use the new catchphrase they
like

320
00:16:22,154 --> 00:16:24,154
And the opening

321
00:16:24,154 --> 00:16:26,154
Ebichu's animation girl

322
00:16:26,154 --> 00:16:28,154
Maimo

323
00:16:28,154 --> 00:16:32,154
I'll introduce myself

324
00:16:32,154 --> 00:16:36,154
Finally it's time to introduce yourself

325
00:16:36,154 --> 00:16:38,154
I'm going to do it

326
00:16:40,154 --> 00:16:42,154
Which one?

327
00:16:42,154 --> 00:16:44,154
The three people who have high
expectations

328
00:16:44,154 --> 00:16:46,154
Let's go

329
00:16:46,154 --> 00:16:48,154
Ready

330
00:16:48,154 --> 00:16:52,154
Will they?

331
00:16:52,154 --> 00:16:54,154
From the top

332
00:16:54,154 --> 00:16:56,154
Maimo

333
00:16:56,154 --> 00:16:58,010
Maimo

334
00:16:58,010 --> 00:17:03,010
The number 3, Mayama Nika, who has high
tension in the game

335
00:17:03,010 --> 00:17:05,010
Then, the last is the third

336
00:17:05,010 --> 00:17:07,010
3

337
00:17:07,010 --> 00:17:09,010
3

338
00:17:12,010 --> 00:17:15,010
It is better not to think calmly and do
not do it

339
00:17:15,010 --> 00:17:17,010
It is Mayama-sama

340
00:17:18,010 --> 00:17:23,010
After this, Matsuno will be judged by
the TASTAS trial

341
00:17:23,010 --> 00:17:28,010
Will the TASTAS trial be completed?

342
00:17:28,010 --> 00:17:31,010
The next basic case is here

343
00:17:31,010 --> 00:17:34,010
The temptation to avoid losing

344
00:17:34,010 --> 00:17:36,010
Who?

345
00:17:36,010 --> 00:17:38,010
I do not know

346
00:17:38,010 --> 00:17:43,010
Then, the defendant, Matsuno Rina,
please go to the defendant's seat

347
00:17:43,010 --> 00:17:45,010
Me?

348
00:17:45,010 --> 00:17:47,010
I'm scared

349
00:17:47,010 --> 00:17:48,010
What does that mean?

350
00:17:48,010 --> 00:17:49,010
Hurry up

351
00:17:49,010 --> 00:17:51,010
I do not know at all

352
00:17:51,010 --> 00:17:53,010
Everyone, open the way

353
00:17:55,010 --> 00:18:01,010
What is the temptation to avoid losing?

354
00:18:03,010 --> 00:18:05,010
Then, the defendant, Takiya Kenji

355
00:18:05,010 --> 00:18:08,010
Please read the basic case

356
00:18:08,010 --> 00:18:10,010
I do not know

357
00:18:10,010 --> 00:18:13,010
I will explain because everyone is not
paying attention

358
00:18:13,010 --> 00:18:17,010
The defendant, Matsuno Rina, in this
program

359
00:18:17,010 --> 00:18:20,010
Lose, that is, drawing

360
00:18:20,010 --> 00:18:23,010
When the members are reflected

361
00:18:23,010 --> 00:18:25,010
I tend to avoid

362
00:18:25,010 --> 00:18:28,010
When other members are talking

363
00:18:28,010 --> 00:18:31,010
I have an expression that my heart is
not here

364
00:18:31,010 --> 00:18:35,010
The staff is very difficult to use

365
00:18:35,010 --> 00:18:39,010
It is difficult to use the drawing of
the draw

366
00:18:39,010 --> 00:18:41,010
I am very confused

367
00:18:41,010 --> 00:18:43,010
Therefore, the defendant, Matsuno Rina

368
00:18:43,010 --> 00:18:47,010
I will compete with others for not being
too interested

369
00:18:47,010 --> 00:18:51,010
Of course, there is a testimony, but I
have a confession

370
00:18:51,010 --> 00:18:53,010
First, I will show you the evidence

371
00:18:53,010 --> 00:18:55,010
No way

372
00:18:55,010 --> 00:18:57,010
I want to see the evidence

373
00:18:57,010 --> 00:18:58,010
Please

374
00:18:58,010 --> 00:19:02,010
Is it true that Matsuno is avoiding the
drawing?

375
00:19:02,010 --> 00:19:04,010
Test with VTR

376
00:19:04,010 --> 00:19:06,010
Please look at everyone

377
00:19:06,010 --> 00:19:08,010
Please

378
00:19:08,010 --> 00:19:09,010
It's familiar

379
00:19:09,010 --> 00:19:11,010
What is the shrimp?

380
00:19:11,010 --> 00:19:13,010
I like sweet shrimp

381
00:19:13,010 --> 00:19:15,010
The members are talking

382
00:19:15,010 --> 00:19:17,010
This is the drawing

383
00:19:17,010 --> 00:19:19,010
Please pay attention

384
00:19:19,010 --> 00:19:21,010
No

385
00:19:21,010 --> 00:19:23,010
Hirota is talking

386
00:19:23,010 --> 00:19:25,010
Look down

387
00:19:25,010 --> 00:19:27,010
What is the truth?

388
00:19:27,010 --> 00:19:29,010
I did my best

389
00:19:29,010 --> 00:19:31,130
Thank you very much

390
00:19:31,130 --> 00:19:32,130
I see.

391
00:19:32,130 --> 00:19:39,130
So, as you can see, while everyone is
talking, only one person is facing down.

392
00:19:39,130 --> 00:19:40,130
No, no.

393
00:19:40,130 --> 00:19:44,130
The grass is like this, the grass at the
bottom is like this.

394
00:19:44,130 --> 00:19:49,130
Kenji, Kenji, for example, if there is a
child like that, it becomes unusable.

395
00:19:49,130 --> 00:19:51,130
That's right, it becomes very difficult
to use.

396
00:19:51,130 --> 00:19:52,130
I see.

397
00:19:52,130 --> 00:19:54,130
The viewers will look at that.

398
00:19:54,130 --> 00:19:55,130
No, no.

399
00:19:55,130 --> 00:19:56,130
What is that?

400
00:19:57,130 --> 00:19:59,130
Just thinking.

401
00:19:59,130 --> 00:20:05,130
If you don't stay still, it becomes very
difficult to use the drawing because of
you.

402
00:20:05,130 --> 00:20:10,130
I think there are many people who are
bored.

403
00:20:10,130 --> 00:20:11,130
I would like to ask them.

404
00:20:12,130 --> 00:20:15,130
Is Matsuno actually bored?

405
00:20:15,130 --> 00:20:18,130
First, Shogun Hoshinaga.

406
00:20:20,130 --> 00:20:26,130
Matsuno-san is very energetic in the
morning and afternoon.

407
00:20:26,130 --> 00:20:29,130
He is definitely very excited.

408
00:20:29,130 --> 00:20:38,130
In the afternoon, he is hungry, he wants
to eat quickly, he wants to sleep
quickly.

409
00:20:38,130 --> 00:20:40,130
He is always on the table.

410
00:20:40,130 --> 00:20:44,130
When he is waiting for the bullet train,
he is also on the table.

411
00:20:44,130 --> 00:20:47,130
When he is bored again, he is like,

412
00:20:47,130 --> 00:20:49,130
I was thinking about shrimp.

413
00:20:49,130 --> 00:20:51,130
He is thinking about shrimp.

414
00:20:51,130 --> 00:20:54,130
He is running away a lot recently.

415
00:20:54,130 --> 00:20:56,130
He is thinking about shrimp.

416
00:20:56,130 --> 00:20:58,130
It's not about shrimp.

417
00:20:58,130 --> 00:21:20,130
I'm sorry.

418
00:21:20,130 --> 00:21:29,130
I'm thinking about a lot of things
because I'm negative.

419
00:21:29,130 --> 00:21:41,130
I'm thinking about whether I was okay or
if I should say something.

420
00:21:41,130 --> 00:21:43,130
It's a development that you can't
imagine.

421
00:21:43,130 --> 00:21:45,130
What is this development?

422
00:21:45,130 --> 00:21:47,130
You're crying or laughing.

423
00:21:47,130 --> 00:21:50,130
I'm thinking about it.

424
00:21:50,130 --> 00:21:51,130
I'm sorry.

425
00:21:51,130 --> 00:21:53,130
This is the thing.

426
00:21:53,130 --> 00:21:56,130
Kenji Takiue is crying.

427
00:21:56,130 --> 00:21:58,130
I understand.

428
00:21:58,130 --> 00:22:04,922
This is a defense.

429
00:22:04,922 --> 00:22:13,922
I often watch the opening talk of TASTAZ
from the position.

430
00:22:13,922 --> 00:22:20,922
When Kenji Takiue is angry, I often look
up at the sky.

431
00:22:20,922 --> 00:22:25,922
But this is because Kenji Takiue's talk
is boring.

432
00:22:25,922 --> 00:22:26,922
Hey, wait a minute.

433
00:22:26,922 --> 00:22:27,922
EGR.

434
00:22:27,922 --> 00:22:29,922
EGR.

435
00:22:29,922 --> 00:22:34,922
Please step back.

436
00:22:34,922 --> 00:22:38,922
Kenji Takiue's talk is either
interesting or boring.

437
00:22:38,922 --> 00:22:39,922
It's boring.

438
00:22:39,922 --> 00:22:40,922
EGR.

439
00:22:40,922 --> 00:22:42,922
Please step back.

440
00:22:42,922 --> 00:22:45,922
My girlfriend is angry.

441
00:22:45,922 --> 00:22:48,922
You are the one who is angry.

442
00:22:48,922 --> 00:22:51,922
The trial is over.

443
00:22:51,922 --> 00:22:56,922
Then, I will explain the flow of the
story.

444
00:22:56,922 --> 00:23:04,922
The reason why the TASTAZ is angry is
because Kenji Takiue's talk is boring.

445
00:23:04,922 --> 00:23:10,922
The verdict is that Kenji Takiue is
innocent if he thinks it's interesting.

446
00:23:10,922 --> 00:23:13,922
If you think it's not interesting, you
are guilty.

447
00:23:13,922 --> 00:23:15,922
What is that?

448
00:23:15,922 --> 00:23:17,922
Isn't that strange?

449
00:23:17,922 --> 00:23:18,922
It's strange.

450
00:23:18,922 --> 00:23:28,922
Then, the verdict is that Kenji Takiue
is guilty or innocent.

451
00:23:28,922 --> 00:23:29,922
Then, I will explain the flow of the
story.

452
00:23:29,922 --> 00:23:31,922
Let's start.

453
00:23:31,922 --> 00:23:35,922
EGR.

454
00:23:35,922 --> 00:23:37,922
This is strange.

455
00:23:37,922 --> 00:23:39,922
What did you think, Hirota?

456
00:23:39,922 --> 00:23:42,922
It's interesting that it's not
interesting.

457
00:23:42,922 --> 00:23:46,922
That's it.

458
00:23:46,922 --> 00:23:50,922
Kenji Takiue is guilty because he is
guilty.

459
00:23:50,922 --> 00:23:52,922
Why?

460
00:23:52,922 --> 00:23:54,922
Why?

461
00:23:54,922 --> 00:23:55,922
What is that?

462
00:23:55,922 --> 00:23:56,922
It's not a slap.

463
00:23:56,922 --> 00:24:08,922
Then, I will explain the story of Kenji
Takiue to the defendant.

464
00:24:08,922 --> 00:24:11,922
EGR.

465
00:24:11,922 --> 00:24:13,922
Great.

466
00:24:13,922 --> 00:24:19,922
Then, the verdict is that Kenji Takiue
is innocent.

467
00:24:19,922 --> 00:24:23,922
Kenji Takiue was not interesting, so it
looked like that.

468
00:24:23,922 --> 00:24:34,922
Then, I will add the trial to EGR.

469
00:24:34,922 --> 00:24:39,922
Hoshina's impersonation was too novel.

470
00:24:39,922 --> 00:24:42,922
Next time, we will talk about the second
round of EGR plus trial.

471
00:24:42,922 --> 00:24:46,922
Who will be the next defendant?

472
00:24:46,922 --> 00:24:48,922
Kenji Takiue.

473
00:24:48,922 --> 00:24:50,922
Next, Nakayama.

474
00:24:50,922 --> 00:24:52,922
Next, Nakayama.

475
00:24:52,922 --> 00:24:56,922
Next, TASTAS trial.

476
00:24:56,922 --> 00:24:58,922
Next, TASTAS trial.

477
00:24:58,922 --> 00:25:01,922
Next, TASTAS trial.

478
00:25:01,922 --> 00:25:06,922
What is the trial?

479
00:25:06,922 --> 00:25:09,922
What is the trial?

480
00:25:09,922 --> 00:25:16,922
This program was provided by the sponsor
you are watching.

481
00:25:16,922 --> 00:25:20,922
Don't give yourself that chance.

482
00:25:20,922 --> 00:25:24,922
What is this?

483
00:25:24,922 --> 00:25:27,922
I don't want to hear that.

484
00:25:27,922 --> 00:25:30,221
I don't want to hear that.
