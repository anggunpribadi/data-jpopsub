1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,000
This time, I'm going to do what I want
to do as MC of Ebichu and Nakayama Riko

2
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:13,000
Ebichu and Nakayama Riko's special
edition

3
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:16,000
Nakayama Riko thought about a project

4
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
Then

5
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:23,546
etc.

6
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:23,546
reality of the

7
00:00:23,546 --> 00:00:27,546
Silence, silent show

8
00:00:27,546 --> 00:00:29,546
However

9
00:00:35,546 --> 00:00:38,546
This time, they suddenly start running

10
00:00:38,546 --> 00:00:40,546
Everything is in a hurry

11
00:00:40,546 --> 00:00:43,546
The sequence of unexpected situations

12
00:00:43,546 --> 00:00:53,546
Nagayama Tastasu Start!

13
00:01:13,546 --> 00:01:18,546
What is it?

14
00:01:18,546 --> 00:01:22,546
What is it?

15
00:01:22,546 --> 00:01:26,546
What is it?

16
00:01:26,546 --> 00:01:30,546
What is it?

17
00:01:32,546 --> 00:01:35,546
Add various things to private Ebisu
Middle School!

18
00:01:35,546 --> 00:01:38,546
Ebisu Tastasu!

19
00:01:38,546 --> 00:01:44,546
This program is provided by the sponsor
you see

20
00:01:54,546 --> 00:01:57,546
It started! Ebisu Tastasu!

21
00:01:57,546 --> 00:01:57,818
Thank you for watching!

22
00:01:57,818 --> 00:01:58,818
Yay!

23
00:01:59,318 --> 00:02:03,818
Today, I, Nakayama, will be the one to
do the daily work

24
00:02:03,818 --> 00:02:05,318
Yes, I want to do my best

25
00:02:05,318 --> 00:02:07,818
This time, Nakayama will do the daily
work

26
00:02:07,818 --> 00:02:08,818
This is the second time

27
00:02:08,818 --> 00:02:11,818
This is the second time since the second
barbecue

28
00:02:11,818 --> 00:02:13,318
You didn't do anything during the
barbecue, right?

29
00:02:13,318 --> 00:02:14,818
Yes, I didn't do anything

30
00:02:14,818 --> 00:02:17,318
This time, I'm really worried

31
00:02:17,318 --> 00:02:20,318
No, we are more worried

32
00:02:20,818 --> 00:02:25,318
By the way, what are you going to do
today in this outfit?

33
00:02:25,318 --> 00:02:29,818
This time, I'm going to do the shrimp-
chewing plus Nakayama Riko

34
00:02:29,818 --> 00:02:31,318
Oh, I see

35
00:02:31,318 --> 00:02:36,318
I'm going to do the daily work as the MC

36
00:02:36,318 --> 00:02:39,818
I'm going to do the shrimp-chewing plus

37
00:02:39,818 --> 00:02:41,818
It's a revolution

38
00:02:41,818 --> 00:02:43,318
Yes, it's a revolution

39
00:02:43,318 --> 00:02:44,818
It's a revolution

40
00:02:44,818 --> 00:02:46,318
It's a big adventure

41
00:02:46,318 --> 00:02:47,318
It's a big adventure

42
00:02:47,318 --> 00:02:50,818
If you don't do it properly as the MC,
you will be in trouble

43
00:02:50,818 --> 00:02:52,318
Do your best

44
00:02:52,318 --> 00:02:53,318
Do your best, Riko

45
00:02:53,318 --> 00:02:55,318
I'm not doing my best

46
00:02:56,318 --> 00:03:02,318
This time, we are going to do the
special episode that MC Nakayama really
thought about

47
00:03:02,318 --> 00:03:04,818
What is Nakayama?

48
00:03:04,818 --> 00:03:04,298
Nakayama, you will do the 1% of the

49
00:03:04,318 --> 00:02:56,778
1% of the

50
00:03:07,318 --> 00:03:08,318
1% of the

51
00:03:08,318 --> 00:03:09,318
1% of the

52
00:03:09,318 --> 00:03:10,318
1% of the

53
00:03:10,318 --> 00:03:11,318
1% of the

54
00:03:13,318 --> 00:03:17,318
Nakayama always exceeds our expectations

55
00:03:17,318 --> 00:03:20,318
I'm sure a new plan will be born

56
00:03:20,318 --> 00:03:24,318
What do you want to do first, Nakayama?

57
00:03:24,318 --> 00:03:26,318
Something easy

58
00:03:26,318 --> 00:03:28,318
Something easy?

59
00:03:28,318 --> 00:03:29,318
What is that?

60
00:03:29,318 --> 00:03:31,318
I'm not doing anything

61
00:03:31,318 --> 00:03:33,318
For example, what should I do?

62
00:03:33,318 --> 00:03:35,318
Just stand like this?

63
00:03:35,318 --> 00:03:36,318
Yes

64
00:03:36,318 --> 00:03:37,318
Just stand like this?

65
00:03:37,318 --> 00:03:38,318
Yes

66
00:03:39,318 --> 00:03:42,318
What a declaration that she is not doing
anything

67
00:03:42,318 --> 00:03:50,318
This time, the staff had a meeting with
Nakayama in advance

68
00:03:50,318 --> 00:03:55,898
What do you want to do if it was a show
that was only for Riko Nakayama?

69
00:03:55,898 --> 00:04:00,898
I can't speak at all

70
00:04:02,898 --> 00:04:05,898
Nakayama's plan started with a light
heart

71
00:04:05,898 --> 00:04:08,898
I can't believe it's going to be like
this

72
00:04:09,898 --> 00:04:11,898
Can I stand up like this?

73
00:04:11,898 --> 00:04:13,898
I want to sit down too

74
00:04:13,898 --> 00:04:15,898
Sit here

75
00:04:15,898 --> 00:04:17,898
This is a good idea

76
00:04:17,898 --> 00:04:19,898
The members will get along with it

77
00:04:19,898 --> 00:04:21,898
Don't talk about anything

78
00:04:21,898 --> 00:04:25,898
Rikuo wants to sit down first

79
00:04:25,898 --> 00:04:27,898
You can sit down

80
00:04:27,898 --> 00:04:29,898
Good night

81
00:04:29,898 --> 00:04:31,898
Start

82
00:04:31,898 --> 00:04:33,898
I can't speak

83
00:04:33,898 --> 00:04:35,898
I spoke

84
00:04:37,898 --> 00:04:39,898
This is not good

85
00:04:39,898 --> 00:04:45,898
The TV reaction is definitely NG in
Nakayama's plan

86
00:04:45,898 --> 00:04:47,898
You can't speak

87
00:04:47,898 --> 00:04:49,898
Please do it again

88
00:04:49,898 --> 00:04:51,898
Start

89
00:05:08,570 --> 00:05:10,570
Thank you for watching.

90
00:05:21,434 --> 00:05:23,434
Let's change the location

91
00:05:30,434 --> 00:05:31,434
This is fun

92
00:05:31,434 --> 00:05:33,434
Nakayama, is this okay?

93
00:05:33,434 --> 00:05:35,434
It's okay, it's the next one

94
00:05:35,434 --> 00:05:37,434
Is it okay?

95
00:05:37,434 --> 00:05:38,434
It's over

96
00:05:38,434 --> 00:05:40,434
It seems that the plan is over

97
00:05:40,434 --> 00:05:42,434
The plan is over

98
00:05:42,434 --> 00:05:44,434
Is this okay?

99
00:05:44,434 --> 00:05:46,434
Is it okay for the treedaka?

100
00:05:46,434 --> 00:05:48,434
I don't mind if you cut this part

101
00:05:48,434 --> 00:05:50,434
Cut it?

102
00:05:50,434 --> 00:05:52,434
It's cut?

103
00:05:52,434 --> 00:05:54,434
It's time to be patient before the next
corner

104
00:05:54,434 --> 00:05:56,434
Patience?

105
00:05:56,434 --> 00:05:58,434
Why do you have a camera?

106
00:05:58,434 --> 00:06:00,434
It's a story that you should do it at
the school

107
00:06:00,434 --> 00:06:02,434
You just messed up your clothes

108
00:06:02,434 --> 00:06:04,434
It's not something to do at the start

109
00:06:04,434 --> 00:06:06,434
Let's go to the next one

110
00:06:06,434 --> 00:06:09,434
Is there anything else you want to do?

111
00:06:11,434 --> 00:06:13,434
I want to do it while running

112
00:06:13,434 --> 00:06:15,434
While running?

113
00:06:15,434 --> 00:06:17,434
Wait a minute

114
00:06:17,434 --> 00:06:19,434
You want to do other program's songs
during the program?

115
00:06:19,434 --> 00:06:21,434
I want to do it

116
00:06:21,434 --> 00:06:26,434
Nakayama said this at the previous
meeting

117
00:06:26,434 --> 00:06:30,434
I want to run in a big place

118
00:06:30,434 --> 00:06:33,434
I want to do missions

119
00:06:36,434 --> 00:06:38,434
It's not a program that Nakayama thought
of

120
00:06:38,434 --> 00:06:41,434
It's something that she just wanted to
do

121
00:06:42,434 --> 00:06:44,434
Nakayama Riko presents

122
00:06:44,434 --> 00:06:49,434
Playing hide and seek while running

123
00:06:49,434 --> 00:06:51,434
I want to decide the rules

124
00:06:51,434 --> 00:06:53,434
Let's divide the teams

125
00:06:53,434 --> 00:06:55,434
There are many people

126
00:06:55,434 --> 00:06:57,434
You can divide as you like

127
00:06:57,434 --> 00:07:01,434
Rika, Ai, Ai, Rina, Nankaho, one person

128
00:07:01,434 --> 00:07:03,434
I see

129
00:07:03,434 --> 00:07:05,434
Let's divide the teams

130
00:07:05,434 --> 00:07:07,434
The one who said it just now is the one
in the back

131
00:07:07,434 --> 00:07:10,434
Rika is over there

132
00:07:10,434 --> 00:07:14,434
Mirei is over there

133
00:07:14,434 --> 00:07:16,434
I see

134
00:07:16,434 --> 00:07:18,434
Kabu is fast

135
00:07:20,434 --> 00:07:23,434
Playing hide and seek during running is
divided into two teams

136
00:07:23,434 --> 00:07:25,434
First, Mayama team

137
00:07:25,434 --> 00:07:27,434
Second, Nakayama team

138
00:07:29,434 --> 00:07:31,434
When everyone is caught, it's over

139
00:07:33,434 --> 00:07:35,434
This is a half-time

140
00:07:35,434 --> 00:07:40,434
There are 3 people in total

141
00:07:40,434 --> 00:07:43,434
By the way, we have a mission

142
00:07:43,434 --> 00:07:45,434
It's like running

143
00:07:45,434 --> 00:07:50,434
Playing hide and seek during running is
this kindergarten

144
00:07:50,434 --> 00:07:56,034
2 floors, 2 floors, and a close-up view

145
00:07:56,034 --> 00:07:58,034
There are three areas in each area.

146
00:08:00,034 --> 00:08:05,034
Each area has items that are necessary
for the mission clear.

147
00:08:07,034 --> 00:08:11,034
These are the Nakayama stamps.

148
00:08:12,034 --> 00:08:17,034
If you can find the stamps without being
caught by the hunter, you have cleared
the mission.

149
00:08:19,034 --> 00:08:21,034
The time limit is 10 minutes.

150
00:08:21,034 --> 00:08:26,034
The hunter will be released in 30
seconds.

151
00:08:26,034 --> 00:08:33,034
If you can escape to the end or clear
the mission, you will get a luxurious
item.

152
00:08:33,034 --> 00:08:35,034
Luxurious item?

153
00:08:35,034 --> 00:08:37,034
Did you think about this?

154
00:08:37,034 --> 00:08:38,034
Yes, I thought about it.

155
00:08:38,034 --> 00:08:40,034
Is it cucumber?

156
00:08:40,034 --> 00:08:41,034
Cucumber?

157
00:08:41,034 --> 00:08:42,034
It's not decided yet.

158
00:08:42,034 --> 00:08:45,034
Even if it's cucumber, it's only
cucumber.

159
00:08:45,034 --> 00:08:47,034
What else is there?

160
00:08:47,034 --> 00:08:51,034
The first is the Mayama team.

161
00:08:54,034 --> 00:08:55,034
Ready!

162
00:08:55,034 --> 00:08:57,034
No, no, no!

163
00:08:57,034 --> 00:08:59,034
It's a 4-man battle.

164
00:08:59,034 --> 00:09:00,034
No, no, no!

165
00:09:00,034 --> 00:09:02,034
I'm going to get caught in 10 minutes.

166
00:09:02,034 --> 00:09:04,034
I'm going to get caught right away.

167
00:09:04,034 --> 00:09:06,034
Stand up!

168
00:09:06,034 --> 00:09:08,034
Stand up!

169
00:09:08,034 --> 00:09:13,034
Oh, I'm scared.

170
00:09:13,082 --> 00:09:17,082
Koba and Hirota move to the second floor
to hide

171
00:09:19,082 --> 00:09:22,082
Mayama and Matsu run in the first floor

172
00:09:23,082 --> 00:09:28,082
They don't catch up with the cameras in
the serious dash

173
00:09:29,082 --> 00:09:31,082
Let's take a break here

174
00:09:32,082 --> 00:09:34,082
We still have time

175
00:09:35,082 --> 00:09:37,082
Now it's time for the hunter

176
00:09:37,082 --> 00:09:42,082
Who will be the first to escape?

177
00:09:44,082 --> 00:09:46,082
Oh no, what should I do?

178
00:09:51,082 --> 00:09:54,082
The runners are screaming out of
excitement

179
00:09:54,082 --> 00:10:02,082
The hunter has moved

180
00:10:13,082 --> 00:10:15,082
I caught you

181
00:10:15,082 --> 00:10:17,082
Why?

182
00:10:17,082 --> 00:10:18,650
To be continued

183
00:10:18,650 --> 00:10:24,650
Just one minute, without any chance,
Kobayashi is secured

184
00:10:24,650 --> 00:10:30,650
The remaining three runners are still in
the game

185
00:10:30,650 --> 00:10:34,650
Right next to Kobayashi

186
00:10:34,650 --> 00:10:37,650
I'm going to get caught

187
00:10:37,650 --> 00:10:42,650
Hirota escaped from the hunter

188
00:10:42,650 --> 00:10:44,650
He disappeared

189
00:10:44,650 --> 00:10:49,650
He's in danger

190
00:10:49,650 --> 00:10:51,650
He's moving

191
00:10:51,650 --> 00:10:58,650
I'm going to get caught

192
00:10:58,650 --> 00:11:00,890
I'm going to get caught

193
00:11:00,890 --> 00:11:01,890
I'm sorry

194
00:11:03,390 --> 00:11:06,390
They hide themselves in the warehouse

195
00:11:08,890 --> 00:11:10,890
Let me rest for a while

196
00:11:11,890 --> 00:11:13,890
I'll take some time

197
00:11:14,390 --> 00:11:16,390
Is it a strategy or a big one?

198
00:11:16,890 --> 00:11:19,890
They decided to hide until the time
comes

199
00:11:21,390 --> 00:11:22,890
Good luck!

200
00:11:23,390 --> 00:11:25,390
That was cool

201
00:11:25,390 --> 00:11:31,390
I don't know that I'm caught

202
00:11:31,390 --> 00:11:33,390
It's hard for the cameraman

203
00:11:33,390 --> 00:11:35,390
Mayama is running there

204
00:11:35,890 --> 00:11:37,890
At that time

205
00:11:39,890 --> 00:11:41,890
Did you find it?

206
00:11:42,890 --> 00:11:46,890
They are looking for the mission stamp

207
00:11:47,390 --> 00:11:49,390
There

208
00:11:49,390 --> 00:11:52,390
The mission stamp is hidden in the
warehouse

209
00:11:52,890 --> 00:11:55,390
The hunter is sneaking

210
00:11:58,390 --> 00:12:02,390
I found it

211
00:12:12,390 --> 00:12:14,390
I can't do it

212
00:12:14,390 --> 00:12:19,390
I found it

213
00:12:19,390 --> 00:12:21,722
Please wait

214
00:12:21,722 --> 00:12:27,722
On the second floor, Mayama's appearance
is also in the library

215
00:12:34,970 --> 00:12:38,970
Found the mission's cry-stamp

216
00:12:39,970 --> 00:12:42,970
But the hunter's evil hand

217
00:12:43,970 --> 00:12:44,970
No!

218
00:12:44,970 --> 00:12:45,970
Found it!

219
00:12:46,970 --> 00:12:47,970
Found it!

220
00:12:49,970 --> 00:12:50,970
Don't come!

221
00:12:51,970 --> 00:12:52,970
Don't come!

222
00:12:52,970 --> 00:13:04,970
The hunter's evil hand

223
00:13:09,818 --> 00:13:11,818
She managed to overcome it

224
00:13:11,818 --> 00:13:13,818
Oh no, I'm scared

225
00:13:15,818 --> 00:13:19,818
Mayama is scared of the hunter

226
00:13:19,818 --> 00:13:21,818
It's about time

227
00:13:21,818 --> 00:13:23,818
Nakayama-san, let's add a hunter

228
00:13:23,818 --> 00:13:25,818
One more hunter, please

229
00:13:26,818 --> 00:13:28,818
The hunter appears

230
00:13:32,818 --> 00:13:34,818
The hunter has appeared from somewhere

231
00:13:34,818 --> 00:13:39,578
The hunter is scared of the hunter

232
00:13:39,578 --> 00:13:45,578
Now there are two hunters. Will the
remaining three escape?

233
00:13:46,578 --> 00:13:48,578
At that time, in the gym...

234
00:13:51,578 --> 00:13:53,578
I'm tired.

235
00:13:54,578 --> 00:13:58,578
Mayama is trapped alone at the limit of
physical strength.

236
00:13:58,578 --> 00:14:00,578
And...

237
00:14:00,578 --> 00:14:03,578
Mayama. Mayama. Mayama.

238
00:14:03,578 --> 00:14:04,578
Mayama.

239
00:14:04,578 --> 00:14:09,578
What will Hirota do in the warehouse in
the back?

240
00:14:13,578 --> 00:14:16,578
Don't worry. Just a little.

241
00:14:16,578 --> 00:14:18,578
Don't go out now.

242
00:14:18,578 --> 00:14:21,146
I won't help you.

243
00:14:21,146 --> 00:14:25,906
He's TaKu bunched up by his creative
nature

244
00:14:25,906 --> 00:14:30,666
Meanwhile, BANN to spend some 강아

245
00:14:31,546 --> 00:14:34,206
Where is it?

246
00:14:34,206 --> 00:14:37,706
How will grant them approval?

247
00:14:44,378 --> 00:14:46,378
I found you!

248
00:14:49,378 --> 00:14:52,378
Will he become a hunter's prey?

249
00:14:52,378 --> 00:15:04,346
Can he escape?

250
00:15:04,346 --> 00:15:08,346
Can he escape the hunter's pursuit?

251
00:15:19,034 --> 00:15:22,034
Matsuno was the first one to get the
power

252
00:15:23,034 --> 00:15:25,034
I'm stuck

253
00:15:25,034 --> 00:15:27,034
How is it?

254
00:15:27,034 --> 00:15:28,034
Two more

255
00:15:28,034 --> 00:15:30,034
She's ready to go

256
00:15:33,034 --> 00:15:35,034
I'm so tired

257
00:15:35,034 --> 00:15:40,634
I'm so tired

258
00:15:40,634 --> 00:15:43,634
4 minutes left

259
00:15:43,634 --> 00:15:47,634
Can the two runners escape?

260
00:15:47,634 --> 00:15:51,634
Aika is caught

261
00:15:51,634 --> 00:15:53,634
Hirotaro is not here

262
00:15:53,634 --> 00:15:56,634
He can't run so he is hiding

263
00:15:56,634 --> 00:15:58,634
I'm not good at running

264
00:15:58,634 --> 00:16:01,634
I'm hiding from the distance

265
00:16:01,634 --> 00:16:02,634
I see

266
00:16:02,634 --> 00:16:04,634
Scary

267
00:16:04,634 --> 00:16:08,634
Hoshina's prediction is correct

268
00:16:08,634 --> 00:16:13,634
Abandon the mission and continue to
escape

269
00:16:13,634 --> 00:16:16,634
Mayama is

270
00:16:16,634 --> 00:16:25,466
Hoshina is

271
00:16:25,466 --> 00:16:28,466
Mission's Yamastampu was discovered

272
00:16:28,466 --> 00:16:41,594
Now he has two stamps

273
00:16:41,594 --> 00:16:44,594
3 minutes left

274
00:16:44,594 --> 00:16:47,594
The 3rd hunter is here

275
00:16:47,594 --> 00:16:50,594
He's chasing the runner

276
00:16:50,594 --> 00:16:53,594
I'm scared of the runner

277
00:16:53,594 --> 00:16:56,762
I can't see him, so I'm chasing him

278
00:16:56,762 --> 00:17:02,762
Hunter Ogata is in the atmosphere where
Mayama is spilling his guts

279
00:17:05,762 --> 00:17:07,762
I can feel it

280
00:17:07,762 --> 00:17:09,762
I can feel it very well

281
00:17:09,762 --> 00:17:19,226
I found you!

282
00:17:19,226 --> 00:17:23,226
He runs to the second floor, but...

283
00:17:23,226 --> 00:17:34,682
He runs to the second floor, but...

284
00:17:34,682 --> 00:17:37,482
Kayama, in great trouble

285
00:17:50,482 --> 00:17:51,482
Stop!

286
00:17:52,282 --> 00:17:54,782
...but to be Les Tian that seems to give
up,

287
00:17:54,782 --> 00:17:56,474
Thanks for watching!

288
00:17:56,474 --> 00:17:58,814
Mayama saves it clear

289
00:18:03,174 --> 00:18:04,174
And

290
00:18:06,434 --> 00:18:08,194
Mayama매amafatu

291
00:18:09,754 --> 00:18:11,594
So he saves the camera

292
00:18:11,594 --> 00:18:15,574
The decisive circle is less driving
Sikakki

293
00:18:16,034 --> 00:18:19,294
Take the sword

294
00:18:26,314 --> 00:18:28,674
slips

295
00:18:28,674 --> 00:18:31,802
Again and again...

296
00:18:31,802 --> 00:19:00,522
They were four at last there Six Rentai

297
00:18:56,282 --> 00:19:00,522
The Blank m truly

298
00:19:00,522 --> 00:19:02,522
Three hunters.

299
00:19:02,522 --> 00:19:04,522
They are in a dangerous trap.

300
00:19:04,522 --> 00:19:24,522
They are in a dangerous trap.

301
00:19:25,178 --> 00:19:30,758
Two hunters are waiting for you

302
00:19:34,970 --> 00:19:39,970
Hirota was the last one to escape

303
00:19:39,970 --> 00:19:41,970
I won

304
00:19:43,970 --> 00:19:46,970
The running record is 9 minutes 29
seconds

305
00:19:46,970 --> 00:19:49,970
They couldn't escape

306
00:19:50,970 --> 00:19:53,970
They escaped for 9 minutes

307
00:19:53,970 --> 00:19:55,970
Amazing

308
00:19:55,970 --> 00:19:57,970
Amazing

309
00:19:57,970 --> 00:19:59,970
Nagayama is coming

310
00:19:59,970 --> 00:20:01,970
Nagayama

311
00:20:01,970 --> 00:20:04,970
Amazing

312
00:20:04,970 --> 00:20:06,970
Who did it?

313
00:20:06,970 --> 00:20:08,970
In the middle of the war

314
00:20:08,970 --> 00:20:14,970
Nagayama was collecting only two mission
stamps

315
00:20:14,970 --> 00:20:18,970
Will they get the luxurious items?

316
00:20:18,970 --> 00:20:20,970
This is not Nagayama

317
00:20:20,970 --> 00:20:22,970
It's Nagayama

318
00:20:22,970 --> 00:20:24,970
Look at this

319
00:20:24,970 --> 00:20:26,970
Look at the inside

320
00:20:26,970 --> 00:20:28,970
Look at the inside

321
00:20:28,970 --> 00:20:30,970
A bug

322
00:20:30,970 --> 00:20:32,970
Really?

323
00:20:32,970 --> 00:20:34,970
This is a bug

324
00:20:34,970 --> 00:20:36,970
This is a bug

325
00:20:36,970 --> 00:20:40,970
There is also a trap stamp

326
00:20:40,970 --> 00:20:43,970
This is annoying

327
00:20:45,970 --> 00:20:48,970
If you press the button, everyone will
die

328
00:20:48,970 --> 00:20:50,970
It's like a monster

329
00:20:50,970 --> 00:20:53,970
People react in a moment

330
00:20:53,970 --> 00:20:56,970
They are like predators

331
00:20:56,970 --> 00:20:59,970
They were excellent hunters

332
00:20:59,970 --> 00:21:01,970
I will run again

333
00:21:01,970 --> 00:21:03,970
You can do it

334
00:21:05,970 --> 00:21:09,970
Nagayama team's challenge

335
00:21:11,970 --> 00:21:13,970
Nagayama, you are next

336
00:21:13,970 --> 00:21:15,970
I was looking forward to it

337
00:21:15,970 --> 00:21:17,970
I was happy to see it

338
00:21:17,970 --> 00:21:19,970
You are just a viewer

339
00:21:19,970 --> 00:21:21,970
It's your turn

340
00:21:21,970 --> 00:21:25,970
The second half starts

341
00:21:25,970 --> 00:21:29,970
I'm going to be a hunter

342
00:21:33,970 --> 00:21:36,970
While the hunters are coming out

343
00:21:36,970 --> 00:21:39,970
The members are looking for a safe place

344
00:21:39,970 --> 00:21:49,970
Nagayama team's challenge

345
00:21:51,002 --> 00:21:53,002
The big guy is very scary.

346
00:21:53,002 --> 00:21:55,002
He looks like a pervert.

347
00:21:58,002 --> 00:22:03,002
The hunter is released.

348
00:22:08,002 --> 00:22:11,002
Hoshina is looking for a safe place.

349
00:22:14,002 --> 00:22:16,002
I don't know.

350
00:22:17,002 --> 00:22:19,002
I don't know what to say.

351
00:22:19,002 --> 00:22:21,002
I don't know what to say.

352
00:22:29,002 --> 00:22:31,002
Where are you hiding?

353
00:22:31,002 --> 00:22:40,250
The idol is serious about the locker.

354
00:22:40,250 --> 00:22:42,250
Who is the most likely to escape?

355
00:22:42,250 --> 00:22:44,250
Mirei-chan

356
00:22:44,250 --> 00:22:46,250
Mirei-chan seems to be tired

357
00:22:46,250 --> 00:22:48,250
Hinata and Sebasikko

358
00:22:48,250 --> 00:22:50,250
I think so

359
00:22:50,250 --> 00:22:52,250
Hinata and Sebasikko are good at using
wisdom

360
00:22:52,250 --> 00:22:54,250
One minute from the beginning

361
00:22:54,250 --> 00:22:58,250
No one can be found yet

362
00:22:58,250 --> 00:23:00,250
Hunter type

363
00:23:00,250 --> 00:23:08,250
The one who is hiding right next to him
is

364
00:23:08,250 --> 00:23:10,250
Scary

365
00:23:14,250 --> 00:23:16,250
Scary

366
00:23:16,250 --> 00:23:18,250
Run

367
00:23:22,250 --> 00:23:24,250
The one who is hiding right next to him
is

368
00:23:24,250 --> 00:23:24,698
Scary

369
00:23:24,698 --> 00:23:29,698
The hunter's presence is not enough to
catch the eye.

370
00:23:29,698 --> 00:23:33,698
At the moment, Yasumoto and Hoshina are
in the gym.

371
00:23:33,698 --> 00:23:35,698
Kashiwagi is in the library.

372
00:23:35,698 --> 00:23:41,698
And this time, Nakayama is in the second
floor hall.

373
00:23:41,698 --> 00:23:47,698
The hunter is in the second floor hall.

374
00:23:47,698 --> 00:23:50,906
Nakayama is in the second floor hall.

375
00:23:50,906 --> 00:23:54,906
