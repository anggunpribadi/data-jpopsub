2
00:00:02,202 --> 00:00:07,202
We have a problem!

3
00:00:07,202 --> 00:00:09,202
What is it?

4
00:00:09,202 --> 00:00:11,202
We have a problem!

5
00:00:11,202 --> 00:00:23,202
Today, we have three people who can
solve our problems!

6
00:00:23,202 --> 00:00:26,202
It's so beautiful!

7
00:00:26,202 --> 00:00:27,202
It's shining!

8
00:00:27,202 --> 00:00:29,202
Look at this!

9
00:00:29,202 --> 00:00:32,202
We've come this far.

10
00:00:32,202 --> 00:00:34,202
We've walked a lot.

11
00:00:34,202 --> 00:00:35,202
I'm tired.

12
00:00:35,202 --> 00:00:37,202
I want to stretch.

13
00:00:37,202 --> 00:00:39,202
Me too.

14
00:00:39,202 --> 00:00:45,202
The teacher is here!

15
00:00:45,202 --> 00:00:47,202
Let's call her!

16
00:00:47,202 --> 00:00:49,202
Ms. Asakura!

17
00:00:49,202 --> 00:00:50,560
Hello!

18
00:00:50,560 --> 00:00:52,560
Hello! Nice to meet you!

19
00:00:52,560 --> 00:00:54,560
Nice to meet you!

20
00:00:54,560 --> 00:00:56,560
Nice to meet you!

21
00:00:56,560 --> 00:00:58,560
Nice to meet you!

22
00:00:58,560 --> 00:01:00,560
This is our first collaboration.

23
00:01:00,560 --> 00:01:02,560
Really?

24
00:01:02,560 --> 00:01:03,560
Yes!

25
00:01:03,560 --> 00:01:05,560
I'm sorry, but I'm a little nervous.

26
00:01:05,560 --> 00:01:07,560
Wow!

27
00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:09,560
Hello!

28
00:01:09,560 --> 00:01:13,560
Today, we're going to help you with your
problems.

29
00:01:13,560 --> 00:01:15,560
Nice to meet you!

30
00:01:15,560 --> 00:01:17,560
Let's make it soft!

31
00:01:17,560 --> 00:01:19,560
I'm so happy!

32
00:01:19,560 --> 00:01:21,560
I'm going to be a complete person!

33
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:26,560
I'm Karen Tachibana. Nice to meet you!

34
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:28,560
Nice to meet you!

35
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:30,560
I'm Karen. Nice to meet you!

36
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:32,560
Nice to meet you!

37
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:35,560
I'd like to ask you a question.

38
00:01:35,560 --> 00:01:39,560
I've been wearing a cat-like collar all
the time.

39
00:01:39,560 --> 00:01:41,560
My neck is a smartphone neck.

40
00:01:41,560 --> 00:01:43,560
It's a roll-shaped collar.

41
00:01:43,560 --> 00:01:45,560
That's right.

42
00:01:45,560 --> 00:01:49,560
I've been doing this for a long time.

43
00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:53,560
It's like a stretch that sticks to the
shoulder blades.

44
00:01:53,560 --> 00:01:55,560
I've never stuck to it.

45
00:01:55,560 --> 00:01:59,560
I've tried this kind of thing.

46
00:01:59,560 --> 00:02:01,560
I don't know much about it.

47
00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:07,560
I'd like to have a stretch that can
improve it.

48
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:09,560
I see.

49
00:02:09,560 --> 00:02:15,560
Do you study a lot when you're a
student?

50
00:02:15,560 --> 00:02:17,560
Or do you watch a lot of smartphones?

51
00:02:17,560 --> 00:02:19,560
I think it's a smartphone.

52
00:02:19,560 --> 00:02:22,560
I heard that my luggage is very heavy.

53
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:25,560
I'm wearing a Boston bag today.

54
00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:27,560
I don't think it's that far.

55
00:02:27,560 --> 00:02:34,560
I don't know much about it, but I think
it's because my luggage is heavy.

56
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:36,560
But I'm sure I have a smartphone.

57
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:38,560
I'll look at it.

58
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:40,560
Do you usually hold it in your right
hand?

59
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:42,560
Yes, I do.

60
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:44,560
Which one is the Boston bag?

61
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:46,560
Right.

62
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:47,560
I see.

63
00:02:47,560 --> 00:02:49,560
The right side of the paddle is rolled
up.

64
00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:50,560
I see.

65
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:52,560
There's a cat-like collar.

66
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:53,560
I see.

67
00:02:53,560 --> 00:02:56,560
I don't care about it that much.

68
00:02:56,560 --> 00:02:59,560
I'm going to do some intense training.

69
00:02:59,560 --> 00:03:02,560
I think my shoulders will hurt.

70
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:05,560
Let's solve that problem with a stretch.

71
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:06,560
Really?

72
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:10,560
Do you know a little about Tawaku?

73
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:14,560
I'm a big fan of him.

74
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:15,560
Really?

75
00:03:15,560 --> 00:03:20,560
I happened to watch his YouTube video
about half a year ago.

76
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:26,560
I was watching a video of people making
a phone call in the middle of a big
city.

77
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:29,560
I thought it was really interesting.

78
00:03:29,560 --> 00:03:32,560
I was watching a video of the army.

79
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:36,560
I happened to hear this story.

80
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:38,560
I was happy to hear it alone.

81
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:40,560
Really?

82
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:43,560
I was excited to see who was coming.

83
00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:45,560
Three men came.

84
00:03:45,560 --> 00:03:46,560
Really?

85
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:49,560
I'm glad I'm a YouTuber.

86
00:03:51,560 --> 00:03:53,560
Really?

87
00:03:53,560 --> 00:03:54,560
It's funny.

88
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:56,560
Let's do our best today.

89
00:03:56,560 --> 00:03:58,560
It's a tough day.

90
00:03:58,560 --> 00:03:59,560
That's right.

91
00:03:59,560 --> 00:04:03,560
You're an idol, so you'll be fine.

92
00:04:03,560 --> 00:04:05,560
I have to do my best.

93
00:04:05,560 --> 00:04:07,560
I've prepared a lot.

94
00:04:07,560 --> 00:04:12,128
Thank you for your continued support.

95
00:04:12,128 --> 00:04:13,728
Thank you for your continued support.

96
00:04:13,728 --> 00:04:16,728
Hello, I'm FUJITANI MIU.

97
00:04:16,728 --> 00:04:18,728
Please call me NAKKI.

98
00:04:18,728 --> 00:04:20,728
Nice to meet you.

99
00:04:20,728 --> 00:04:22,728
I have a question.

100
00:04:22,728 --> 00:04:26,728
I hold the microphone with my left hand.

101
00:04:26,728 --> 00:04:30,728
My left hand is very cold.

102
00:04:30,728 --> 00:04:32,728
What should I do?

103
00:04:32,728 --> 00:04:34,728
I see.

104
00:04:34,728 --> 00:04:36,728
Only your left hand?

105
00:04:36,728 --> 00:04:38,728
I have a problem with my right hand.

106
00:04:38,728 --> 00:04:43,728
I feel very tight. I want to lower my
hand.

107
00:04:43,728 --> 00:04:48,728
I hold the microphone with my left hand.

108
00:04:48,728 --> 00:04:50,728
Which part of your body is tight?

109
00:04:50,728 --> 00:04:51,728
My elbow?

110
00:04:51,728 --> 00:04:53,728
I don't know.

111
00:04:53,728 --> 00:04:55,728
I hold the microphone with my left hand.

112
00:04:55,728 --> 00:04:57,728
I see.

113
00:04:57,728 --> 00:05:00,728
Muscle strength is important.

114
00:05:00,728 --> 00:05:03,728
The microphone is heavy.

115
00:05:03,728 --> 00:05:05,728
Yes, it is.

116
00:05:05,728 --> 00:05:10,728
Muscle strength is important, but it is
difficult to enter the stage if your
body is stiff.

117
00:05:10,728 --> 00:05:11,728
Is your body stiff?

118
00:05:11,728 --> 00:05:13,728
Yes, it is.

119
00:05:13,728 --> 00:05:15,728
It's stiff.

120
00:05:15,728 --> 00:05:16,728
It's stiff.

121
00:05:16,728 --> 00:05:18,728
Can you do a banzai?

122
00:05:18,728 --> 00:05:19,728
Yes, I can.

123
00:05:19,728 --> 00:05:20,728
Can you go further?

124
00:05:20,728 --> 00:05:23,728
I'm good at it.

125
00:05:23,728 --> 00:05:26,728
You are good at it.

126
00:05:26,728 --> 00:05:28,728
Am I good at it?

127
00:05:28,728 --> 00:05:30,728
You are not good at it.

128
00:05:30,728 --> 00:05:31,728
I'm not good at it.

129
00:05:31,728 --> 00:05:33,728
I'm frustrated.

130
00:05:33,728 --> 00:05:37,728
Do you have any other problems?

131
00:05:37,728 --> 00:05:40,728
I watch my smartphone too much.

132
00:05:40,728 --> 00:05:42,728
My neck and shoulders hurt.

133
00:05:42,728 --> 00:05:44,464
Thank you for your viewing.

134
00:05:44,464 --> 00:05:46,464
I watch your videos a lot.

135
00:05:46,464 --> 00:05:48,464
Yes, I watch your videos a lot.

136
00:05:48,464 --> 00:05:51,456
Please subscribe to my channel.

137
00:05:51,456 --> 00:05:53,456
Look over there.

138
00:05:59,456 --> 00:06:01,456
Your head is in front of you.

139
00:06:01,456 --> 00:06:03,456
No, my neck.

140
00:06:05,456 --> 00:06:09,456
Your neck is long, so your head is in
front of you.

141
00:06:09,456 --> 00:06:11,456
No, my neck.

142
00:06:11,456 --> 00:06:13,456
Your neck is long, so your neck is
called a straight neck.

143
00:06:13,456 --> 00:06:15,456
Straight neck.

144
00:06:17,456 --> 00:06:19,456
It's a lot of pressure on your neck.

145
00:06:19,456 --> 00:06:23,456
You need a lot of muscle strength.

146
00:06:23,456 --> 00:06:25,456
I see.

147
00:06:25,456 --> 00:06:27,456
Even if your body is stiff, it's a lot
of pressure.

148
00:06:27,456 --> 00:06:33,456
Today, let's do a good stretch around
the neck, the biceps, and the arms.

149
00:06:33,456 --> 00:06:37,024
Thank you very much.

150
00:06:37,024 --> 00:06:38,024
Thank you very much.

151
00:06:40,024 --> 00:06:41,024
I'm Kichita Shinju.

152
00:06:42,024 --> 00:06:43,024
Please call me Shinju-chan.

153
00:06:44,024 --> 00:06:46,024
I'm looking forward to working with you.

154
00:06:48,024 --> 00:06:51,024
My problem is that my body is stiff.

155
00:06:53,024 --> 00:06:55,024
But I don't care about that today.

156
00:06:57,024 --> 00:07:00,024
I want to surprise them.

157
00:07:01,024 --> 00:07:05,024
Ogata-re-san, would you please cooperate
with me?

158
00:07:05,024 --> 00:07:06,024
Let's do it.

159
00:07:09,024 --> 00:07:10,024
Thank you very much.

160
00:07:10,024 --> 00:07:12,024
How do you want me to do it?

161
00:07:15,024 --> 00:07:19,024
She really believes in anything.

162
00:07:20,024 --> 00:07:23,024
She's pure, so she really believes in
anything.

163
00:07:24,024 --> 00:07:26,024
I'll show you a stretching that doesn't
work.

164
00:07:28,024 --> 00:07:32,024
It's a stretch, but it doesn't work.

165
00:07:32,024 --> 00:07:35,024
That's it.

166
00:07:37,024 --> 00:07:39,024
I was going to do about 10 of them
today.

167
00:07:40,024 --> 00:07:44,024
I heard your worries and did about three
of them.

168
00:07:46,024 --> 00:07:47,024
It's completely different.

169
00:07:47,024 --> 00:07:48,024
It's a strange feeling.

170
00:07:49,024 --> 00:07:50,024
It's the best.

171
00:07:50,024 --> 00:07:51,024
What about the last one?

172
00:07:52,024 --> 00:07:54,024
I have something I want to do last.

173
00:07:55,024 --> 00:07:57,024
I like manga.

174
00:07:58,024 --> 00:08:00,024
I always do girls.

175
00:08:00,024 --> 00:08:02,024
I like girls, too.

176
00:08:02,024 --> 00:08:03,024
Let's do it.

177
00:08:04,024 --> 00:08:05,024
Which one do you want to do?

178
00:08:06,024 --> 00:08:07,024
I got it.

179
00:08:08,024 --> 00:08:09,024
That's great.

180
00:08:10,024 --> 00:08:13,024
Let's do this together.

181
00:08:14,024 --> 00:08:17,024
I'll do it normally, so please decide.

182
00:08:17,024 --> 00:08:19,024
Please stop for 30 seconds.

183
00:08:20,024 --> 00:08:21,024
Let's do it.

184
00:08:21,024 --> 00:08:22,024
Please.

185
00:08:22,024 --> 00:08:23,024
I hope it works.

186
00:08:24,024 --> 00:08:25,024
I can do it.

187
00:08:25,024 --> 00:08:27,024
I'm good at lying.

188
00:08:27,024 --> 00:08:29,024
It looks delicious.

189
00:08:32,544 --> 00:08:34,336
Yay!

190
00:08:34,336 --> 00:08:38,596
So, let's start the stretching!

191
00:08:38,596 --> 00:08:40,596
Thank you for your time!

192
00:08:40,596 --> 00:08:42,596
Thank you!

193
00:08:42,596 --> 00:08:49,856
So, let's check your body's hardness.

194
00:08:49,856 --> 00:08:54,556
First, check your body's hardness.

195
00:08:54,556 --> 00:08:59,476
Open your legs and stretch your knees.

196
00:08:59,476 --> 00:09:02,476
Can you reach your right hand?

197
00:09:02,476 --> 00:09:04,476
Please try it!

198
00:09:04,476 --> 00:09:08,476
Let's do it together!

199
00:09:08,476 --> 00:09:12,476
Oh, it's hard!

200
00:09:12,476 --> 00:09:14,476
Karen is...

201
00:09:14,476 --> 00:09:16,476
Well, well, well...

202
00:09:16,476 --> 00:09:18,476
Shinji and Lucky are...

203
00:09:18,476 --> 00:09:20,476
Lucky!

204
00:09:20,476 --> 00:09:22,476
Lucky is...

205
00:09:22,476 --> 00:09:24,476
Okay, let's go back.

206
00:09:24,476 --> 00:09:26,476
Well, okay, it's hard.

207
00:09:26,476 --> 00:09:28,476
It's hard.

208
00:09:28,476 --> 00:09:30,476
Let's check the second one.

209
00:09:30,476 --> 00:09:35,476
First, keep your legs shoulder-width
apart and put your right elbow in front
of your chest.

210
00:09:35,476 --> 00:09:37,476
That's right.

211
00:09:37,476 --> 00:09:40,476
Raise your left elbow up.

212
00:09:40,476 --> 00:09:42,476
Your face is facing forward.

213
00:09:42,476 --> 00:09:48,476
If your elbow is higher than your nose,
it's okay.

214
00:09:48,476 --> 00:09:50,476
Should I lower my nose?

215
00:09:50,476 --> 00:09:52,476
You can't lower your nose.

216
00:09:52,476 --> 00:09:54,476
I think it's better to raise my nose.

217
00:09:54,476 --> 00:09:56,476
Shinji is...

218
00:09:56,476 --> 00:09:58,476
Okay.

219
00:09:58,476 --> 00:10:00,476
Oh, my God!

220
00:10:00,476 --> 00:10:02,476
Is this human?

221
00:10:02,476 --> 00:10:04,476
I don't know.

222
00:10:04,476 --> 00:10:06,476
Wow!

223
00:10:06,476 --> 00:10:08,476
Karen is amazing.

224
00:10:08,476 --> 00:10:10,476
It's pretty hard.

225
00:10:10,476 --> 00:10:12,476
Oh, my God!

226
00:10:12,476 --> 00:10:14,476
It's not human.

227
00:10:14,476 --> 00:10:16,476
It's a cat shape, but it's a roll.

228
00:10:16,476 --> 00:10:18,476
Oh, my God!

229
00:10:18,476 --> 00:10:20,476
It's a roll.

230
00:10:20,476 --> 00:10:22,476
It's a roll.

231
00:10:22,476 --> 00:10:24,476
It's hard.

232
00:10:24,476 --> 00:10:26,476
The last one is a return.

233
00:10:26,476 --> 00:10:30,476
Put your hips on the edge of the mat.

234
00:10:30,476 --> 00:10:34,476
Then, open your legs as much as you can.

235
00:10:34,476 --> 00:10:36,476
If your legs fit in the mat, it's okay.

236
00:10:36,476 --> 00:10:38,476
Good luck!

237
00:10:38,476 --> 00:10:40,476
This is suspicious.

238
00:10:40,476 --> 00:10:42,476
How is it?

239
00:10:42,476 --> 00:10:48,476
Put your hands in front of you, put your
chest out, and see if you can sit down.

240
00:10:48,476 --> 00:10:50,476
Please tell me if this is easy.

241
00:10:50,476 --> 00:10:52,476
How is it, everyone?

242
00:10:52,476 --> 00:10:54,476
It's easy.

243
00:10:54,476 --> 00:10:56,476
It's hard.

244
00:10:56,476 --> 00:10:58,476
It's hard.

245
00:10:58,476 --> 00:11:00,476
Thank you. Let's get back to the
starting position.

246
00:11:00,476 --> 00:11:04,476
You guys are pretty hard.

247
00:11:04,476 --> 00:11:08,476
We're going to do 10 stretches.

248
00:11:08,476 --> 00:11:10,476
It's getting harder and harder.

249
00:11:10,476 --> 00:11:12,476
Let's do our best.

250
00:11:12,476 --> 00:11:16,476
First of all, please sit down and look
up.

251
00:11:16,476 --> 00:11:18,476
Yes.

252
00:11:18,476 --> 00:11:22,476
If you learn from the front, you'll be
able to put your arms together.

253
00:11:22,476 --> 00:11:24,476
Bend your knees slightly.

254
00:11:24,476 --> 00:11:28,476
Let's do it with all your might.

255
00:11:28,476 --> 00:11:32,476
Put your hands out in front of you.

256
00:11:32,476 --> 00:11:34,476
Then your back will stretch.

257
00:11:34,476 --> 00:11:36,476
I'm so nervous.

258
00:11:36,476 --> 00:11:42,476
Stretch your elbows and keep them
straight for 30 seconds.

259
00:11:42,476 --> 00:11:46,476
If the middle of your back stretches,
it's okay.

260
00:11:46,476 --> 00:11:48,476
My chest hurts.

261
00:11:48,476 --> 00:11:52,476
Then bend your elbows slightly.

262
00:11:52,476 --> 00:11:54,476
Okay, let's go back.

263
00:11:54,476 --> 00:11:56,476
It's warm.

264
00:11:56,476 --> 00:12:00,476
The collarbone is not moving much.

265
00:12:00,476 --> 00:12:02,476
If this area is hard, this stretch will
hurt.

266
00:12:02,476 --> 00:12:06,476
I think that's why it's connected to the
tiredness of your arms.

267
00:12:06,476 --> 00:12:08,476
I see. It's amazing.

268
00:12:08,476 --> 00:12:10,476
It suits you.

269
00:12:10,476 --> 00:12:12,476
It's an order made.

270
00:12:12,476 --> 00:12:14,476
Let's move on to the second one.

271
00:12:14,476 --> 00:12:16,476
The second one is four times as much.

272
00:12:16,476 --> 00:12:20,476
When you're ready, put one leg on the
right foot.

273
00:12:20,476 --> 00:12:22,476
Put your right foot forward.

274
00:12:22,476 --> 00:12:24,476
I'm not a human.

275
00:12:24,476 --> 00:12:26,476
Put your right foot forward.

276
00:12:26,476 --> 00:12:30,476
Put your left foot behind you.

277
00:12:30,476 --> 00:12:34,476
Move your back to the floor.

278
00:12:34,476 --> 00:12:36,476
It's my first time doing this.

279
00:12:36,476 --> 00:12:38,476
Then your right hip will stretch.

280
00:12:38,476 --> 00:12:42,476
Keep it for 30 seconds.

281
00:12:42,476 --> 00:12:44,476
Start.

282
00:12:44,476 --> 00:12:46,476
Relax your core muscles.

283
00:12:47,712 --> 00:12:58,072
One of the key points of taking an
instructor class is that they mindlessly
refer to their own hash.

284
00:12:58,874 --> 00:13:00,874
It hurts!

285
00:13:00,874 --> 00:13:02,874
Does it hurt?

286
00:13:02,874 --> 00:13:05,874
Yes, okay, let's do the other side.

287
00:13:05,874 --> 00:13:08,874
Left foot forward,

288
00:13:08,874 --> 00:13:10,874
both elbows are bent,

289
00:13:10,874 --> 00:13:12,874
and take 30 seconds.

290
00:13:12,874 --> 00:13:13,874
Start!

291
00:13:13,874 --> 00:13:15,874
Okay, let's go back.

292
00:13:16,874 --> 00:13:19,874
This time, we'll do the stretching on
the back of the thighs.

293
00:13:19,874 --> 00:13:21,874
Stretch both feet.

294
00:13:21,874 --> 00:13:23,874
After stretching,

295
00:13:23,874 --> 00:13:25,874
hold your hand at the tip of your toes.

296
00:13:25,874 --> 00:13:29,874
If you can't reach it, hold it at the
tip of your toes.

297
00:13:29,874 --> 00:13:31,874
Bring it as far as you can,

298
00:13:31,874 --> 00:13:33,874
and take 30 seconds.

299
00:13:33,874 --> 00:13:36,448
Start!

300
00:13:36,448 --> 00:13:38,448
Stretch the back of your thighs.

301
00:13:40,096 --> 00:13:42,096
I feel like I'm listening.

302
00:13:42,096 --> 00:13:44,096
Good.

303
00:13:44,096 --> 00:13:46,096
It's stretching, isn't it?

304
00:13:46,096 --> 00:13:48,096
It's stretching.

305
00:13:48,096 --> 00:13:50,096
Okay, let's go back.

306
00:13:50,096 --> 00:13:52,096
Next, we'll do the back of your thighs.

307
00:13:52,096 --> 00:13:54,096
Let's do this in the same direction as
me.

308
00:13:54,096 --> 00:13:56,096
I'll explain how to do it.

309
00:13:56,096 --> 00:14:02,096
If you lie down, put your hands behind
your head.

310
00:14:02,096 --> 00:14:04,096
Okay.

311
00:14:04,096 --> 00:14:06,096
Bend your legs like this.

312
00:14:06,096 --> 00:14:10,096
Bend your legs like this.

313
00:14:10,096 --> 00:14:12,096
Good.

314
00:14:12,096 --> 00:14:14,096
Like this.

315
00:14:14,096 --> 00:14:17,096
Keep your legs like this.

316
00:14:17,096 --> 00:14:19,096
Can you keep it?

317
00:14:19,096 --> 00:14:21,096
What are you talking about?

318
00:14:21,096 --> 00:14:23,096
Keep it for 30 seconds.

319
00:14:23,096 --> 00:14:25,096
Start!

320
00:14:25,096 --> 00:14:27,936
I'm about to get a cramp.

321
00:14:27,936 --> 00:14:29,936
What?

322
00:14:29,936 --> 00:14:31,936
I don't want to do it.

323
00:14:31,936 --> 00:14:33,936
No!

324
00:14:33,936 --> 00:14:37,936
OK, let's start with standing.

325
00:14:37,936 --> 00:14:39,936
Have you been doing it for a while?

326
00:14:39,936 --> 00:14:41,936
Yes.

327
00:14:41,936 --> 00:14:43,936
I'm getting a cramp.

328
00:14:43,936 --> 00:14:46,936
Next, let's do arm exercises.

329
00:14:46,936 --> 00:14:48,936
Bend your knees slightly.

330
00:14:48,936 --> 00:14:51,936
It's like squatting.

331
00:14:51,936 --> 00:14:54,936
Put your palms in front of you.

332
00:14:54,936 --> 00:14:59,936
Pull your fingertips towards you.

333
00:14:59,936 --> 00:15:01,936
It hurts!

334
00:15:01,936 --> 00:15:03,936
Keep it for 30 seconds.

335
00:15:03,936 --> 00:15:05,936
It's working!

336
00:15:05,936 --> 00:15:11,952
I'll do this all the time when I'm on a
date.

337
00:15:11,952 --> 00:15:13,952
It's amazing. It hurts.

338
00:15:13,952 --> 00:15:14,952
It hurts.

339
00:15:14,952 --> 00:15:15,952
This part is stretching.

340
00:15:15,952 --> 00:15:16,952
That's right.

341
00:15:16,952 --> 00:15:19,952
Is there a reason why you bend your
knees like this?

342
00:15:19,952 --> 00:15:21,952
It's easier to stretch if you bend your
knees.

343
00:15:21,952 --> 00:15:22,952
Oh, really?

344
00:15:22,952 --> 00:15:23,952
Oh, that's true.

345
00:15:23,952 --> 00:15:24,952
Oh, that's true.

346
00:15:24,952 --> 00:15:25,952
Oh, that's true.

347
00:15:25,952 --> 00:15:26,952
That's great.

348
00:15:26,952 --> 00:15:27,952
Okay.

349
00:15:27,952 --> 00:15:29,952
Next, we're going to do it one by one.

350
00:15:29,952 --> 00:15:34,952
I said lucky, but if you have a
microphone, your hands will get tired.

351
00:15:34,952 --> 00:15:42,952
I'm going to stretch my index finger and
middle finger, which are especially hard
to stretch.

352
00:15:42,952 --> 00:15:43,952
GALPIECE

353
00:15:43,952 --> 00:15:44,952
Cute.

354
00:15:44,952 --> 00:15:45,952
I'll do this for 30 seconds.

355
00:15:45,952 --> 00:15:46,952
GALPIECE

356
00:15:46,952 --> 00:15:47,952
Cute.

357
00:15:47,952 --> 00:15:48,952
GALPIECE is popular.

358
00:15:48,952 --> 00:15:51,456
GALPIECE

359
00:15:51,456 --> 00:15:54,456
It's working. It's working.

360
00:15:54,456 --> 00:15:55,456
It's working.

361
00:15:55,456 --> 00:15:57,456
It's working.

362
00:15:57,456 --> 00:15:59,456
It's fun.

363
00:15:59,456 --> 00:16:01,456
It's fun.

364
00:16:01,456 --> 00:16:04,456
There are four left.

365
00:16:04,456 --> 00:16:06,456
Three is the face.

366
00:16:06,456 --> 00:16:09,456
It's a pretty small face.

367
00:16:09,456 --> 00:16:13,456
First of all, it's a little
embarrassing.

368
00:16:13,456 --> 00:16:17,664
I'm going to do my best to make the
lower lip look good.

369
00:16:17,664 --> 00:16:19,664
That's all.

370
00:16:19,664 --> 00:16:21,664
Keep this for 30 seconds.

371
00:16:21,664 --> 00:16:23,664
Let's go.

372
00:16:23,664 --> 00:16:26,800
Start!

373
00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:29,800
You can open your mouth and talk.

374
00:16:29,800 --> 00:16:31,800
Your lips will come forward.

375
00:16:31,800 --> 00:16:33,800
Where does this work?

376
00:16:33,800 --> 00:16:35,800
Around the neck.

377
00:16:35,800 --> 00:16:37,800
Around the chin.

378
00:16:37,800 --> 00:16:40,800
It's a straight line that works on the
face line.

379
00:16:43,800 --> 00:16:45,800
Under the chin.

380
00:16:45,800 --> 00:16:47,800
The more you put it out, the more it
works.

381
00:16:47,800 --> 00:16:49,800
If it doesn't work, the soup is not
enough.

382
00:16:49,800 --> 00:16:50,800
It's not enough.

383
00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:51,800
I'm putting it out a lot.

384
00:16:51,800 --> 00:16:53,800
I'm putting it out a lot.

385
00:16:53,800 --> 00:16:55,552
I'm putting it out a lot.

386
00:16:55,552 --> 00:16:57,552
I'm tired.

387
00:16:57,552 --> 00:16:59,552
Okay.

388
00:16:59,552 --> 00:17:01,552
I'm tired.

389
00:17:01,552 --> 00:17:05,552
Next, I'm going to fix the weight around
the eyes.

390
00:17:05,552 --> 00:17:09,552
I often have heavy eyelids in the
morning.

391
00:17:09,552 --> 00:17:11,552
I'm going to fix that.

392
00:17:11,552 --> 00:17:15,552
Push the little bit above the eyes with
your fingers.

393
00:17:15,552 --> 00:17:17,552
Then raise it up.

394
00:17:17,552 --> 00:17:21,552
Pull your chin and raise your hand up.

395
00:17:21,552 --> 00:17:25,552
It's like looking at the front.

396
00:17:25,552 --> 00:17:27,552
Keep it for 30 seconds.

397
00:17:27,552 --> 00:17:29,856
Cut.

398
00:17:29,856 --> 00:17:34,856
Please try to make your eyes bigger.

399
00:17:36,816 --> 00:17:38,216
Yes, that's right.

400
00:17:38,216 --> 00:17:41,516
You can't look at the white part of your
eyes,

401
00:17:41,516 --> 00:17:44,816
but you can look at the upper part of
your eyes.

402
00:17:44,816 --> 00:17:48,516
You can see the swelling around your
eyes.

403
00:17:48,516 --> 00:17:49,916
Hahaha.

404
00:17:49,916 --> 00:17:51,816
It's hard.

405
00:17:51,816 --> 00:17:53,816
Okay, that's good.

406
00:17:53,816 --> 00:17:54,616
It's not bad.

407
00:17:54,616 --> 00:17:56,016
Wow.

408
00:17:56,016 --> 00:17:56,716
Wow.

409
00:17:56,716 --> 00:17:58,216
It's so light.

410
00:17:58,216 --> 00:17:59,916
It's easy to see.

411
00:17:59,916 --> 00:18:00,716
It's easy to see.

412
00:18:00,716 --> 00:18:03,616
Now, let's look at the upper part of
your eyes.

413
00:18:03,616 --> 00:18:10,716
The eyebrows are important for the size
of your eyes and facial expression.

414
00:18:10,716 --> 00:18:12,216
Please pinch your eyebrows.

415
00:18:12,216 --> 00:18:13,316
Okay.

416
00:18:13,316 --> 00:18:16,216
Please pinch your upper and lower
eyebrows and pull them out.

417
00:18:16,216 --> 00:18:17,216
Like this?

418
00:18:17,216 --> 00:18:21,216
Make your eyes bigger and keep them for
30 seconds.

419
00:18:21,216 --> 00:18:22,944
Start!

420
00:18:22,944 --> 00:18:24,944
Make your eyes bigger and keep them for
30 seconds.

421
00:18:25,944 --> 00:18:26,944
Wow, good!

422
00:18:27,944 --> 00:18:29,944
You are good at it!

423
00:18:30,944 --> 00:18:32,944
I'm enjoying it!

424
00:18:32,944 --> 00:18:34,944
Pull your eyes like this.

425
00:18:34,944 --> 00:18:36,944
Okay, it's done.

426
00:18:37,944 --> 00:18:39,944
This is the last stretch.

427
00:18:39,944 --> 00:18:41,944
Let's do our best!

428
00:18:41,944 --> 00:18:44,944
Put your left hand out like this.

429
00:18:44,944 --> 00:18:46,944
Put your right hip in.

430
00:18:46,944 --> 00:18:48,944
Keep them for 30 seconds.

431
00:18:48,944 --> 00:18:52,640
開始!

432
00:18:52,640 --> 00:18:54,640
How do you feel?

433
00:18:54,640 --> 00:18:56,640
Is this the side of the belly?

434
00:18:56,640 --> 00:18:58,640
Yes, it is.

435
00:18:58,640 --> 00:19:00,640
And around the arm.

436
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:02,640
The side of the left side.

437
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:04,640
And the inner thigh.

438
00:19:04,640 --> 00:19:06,800
I think it's a

439
00:19:06,800 --> 00:19:08,800
Yes, it's okay.

440
00:19:08,800 --> 00:19:10,800
Wow!

441
00:19:10,800 --> 00:19:12,800
So I did all 10.

442
00:19:12,800 --> 00:19:14,800
How was it?

443
00:19:14,800 --> 00:19:16,800
It was really light.

444
00:19:16,800 --> 00:19:18,800
The eyes are really easy to open.

445
00:19:18,800 --> 00:19:20,800
Really?

446
00:19:20,800 --> 00:19:22,800
I can go anywhere.

447
00:19:22,800 --> 00:19:24,800
I've never done this before.

448
00:19:24,800 --> 00:19:26,800
I've done a lot of moves.

449
00:19:26,800 --> 00:19:28,800
Which one was your favorite?

450
00:19:28,800 --> 00:19:30,800
From all the stages?

451
00:19:30,800 --> 00:19:32,800
The eyes were really easy to open.

452
00:19:32,800 --> 00:19:34,800
Yes, it was.

453
00:19:34,800 --> 00:19:36,800
This one?

454
00:19:36,800 --> 00:19:38,800
Yes, this one.

455
00:19:38,800 --> 00:19:40,800
It was cute.

456
00:19:40,800 --> 00:19:42,800
It was easy to move.

457
00:19:42,800 --> 00:19:44,800
It was fun.

458
00:19:44,800 --> 00:19:46,800
I can't show it in the park.

459
00:19:46,800 --> 00:19:48,800
How about you, Emi?

460
00:19:48,800 --> 00:19:50,800
I didn't ask you.

461
00:19:50,800 --> 00:19:52,800
Why?

462
00:19:52,800 --> 00:19:54,800
Why?

463
00:19:54,800 --> 00:19:56,800
Well,

464
00:19:56,800 --> 00:19:58,800
I was doing a stretch

465
00:19:58,800 --> 00:20:00,800
that was not effective at all.

466
00:20:00,800 --> 00:20:02,800
It was a prank.

467
00:20:02,800 --> 00:20:04,800
Yay!

468
00:20:04,800 --> 00:20:06,800
What?

469
00:20:06,800 --> 00:20:08,800
What?

470
00:20:08,800 --> 00:20:10,800
Who did you do it for?

471
00:20:10,800 --> 00:20:12,800
This one?

472
00:20:12,800 --> 00:20:14,800
What?

473
00:20:14,800 --> 00:20:16,800
What?

474
00:20:16,800 --> 00:20:18,800
Where?

475
00:20:18,800 --> 00:20:20,800
I heard it.

476
00:20:20,800 --> 00:20:22,800
Really?

477
00:20:22,800 --> 00:20:24,800
I heard it.

478
00:20:24,800 --> 00:20:26,800
Try it.

479
00:20:26,800 --> 00:20:28,800
I heard it.

480
00:20:28,800 --> 00:20:30,800
Really?

481
00:20:30,800 --> 00:20:32,800
It was a lie.

482
00:20:32,800 --> 00:20:34,800
Really?

483
00:20:34,800 --> 00:20:36,800
It was a lie?

484
00:20:36,800 --> 00:20:38,800
No, it wasn't.

485
00:20:38,800 --> 00:20:40,800
I really opened my eyes.

486
00:20:40,800 --> 00:20:42,800
Really?

487
00:20:42,800 --> 00:20:44,800
I'm embarrassed.

488
00:20:44,800 --> 00:20:46,800
Why?

489
00:20:46,800 --> 00:20:48,800
I'm embarrassed.

490
00:20:48,800 --> 00:20:50,800
Where did you think it was a lie?

491
00:20:50,800 --> 00:20:52,800
In the gym?

492
00:20:52,800 --> 00:20:54,800
What?

493
00:20:54,800 --> 00:20:56,800
This one?

494
00:20:56,800 --> 00:20:58,800
This one?

495
00:20:58,800 --> 00:21:00,800
I didn't hear that

496
00:21:00,800 --> 00:21:02,800
I was doing it wrong.

497
00:21:02,800 --> 00:21:04,800
Really?

498
00:21:04,800 --> 00:21:06,800
The last one?

499
00:21:06,800 --> 00:21:08,800
The last one?

500
00:21:08,800 --> 00:21:10,800
The last one?

501
00:21:10,800 --> 00:21:12,800
This one?

502
00:21:12,800 --> 00:21:14,800
I've never seen it.

503
00:21:14,800 --> 00:21:16,800
It was effective.

504
00:21:16,800 --> 00:21:18,800
It was the fourth one.

505
00:21:18,800 --> 00:21:20,800
The first one?

506
00:21:20,800 --> 00:21:22,800
From this one.

507
00:21:22,800 --> 00:21:24,800
I couldn't do it at all.

508
00:21:24,800 --> 00:21:26,800
I couldn't do it.

509
00:21:26,800 --> 00:21:28,800
I couldn't do it because it didn't work.

510
00:21:28,800 --> 00:21:30,800
I couldn't do it because I didn't have a
good feeling.

511
00:21:30,800 --> 00:21:32,800
I couldn't do it because I didn't have a
good feeling.

512
00:21:32,800 --> 00:21:34,800
That's right.

513
00:21:34,800 --> 00:21:36,800
It was amazing.

514
00:21:36,800 --> 00:21:38,800
It was really good.

515
00:21:38,800 --> 00:21:40,800
You were telling me something.

516
00:21:40,800 --> 00:21:42,800
Even if I ask you a question that's hard
to answer,

517
00:21:42,800 --> 00:21:44,800
you always answer it.

518
00:21:44,800 --> 00:21:46,800
I didn't doubt it at all.

519
00:21:46,800 --> 00:21:48,800
It was amazing.

520
00:21:48,800 --> 00:21:50,800
Really?

521
00:21:50,800 --> 00:21:52,800
You knew it was a new challenge?

522
00:21:52,800 --> 00:21:54,800
I said I wanted to do it.

523
00:21:54,800 --> 00:21:56,800
I was asked to cooperate this time.

524
00:21:56,800 --> 00:21:58,800
I see.

525
00:21:58,800 --> 00:22:00,800
I succeeded.

526
00:22:00,800 --> 00:22:02,800
I was surprised.

527
00:22:02,800 --> 00:22:04,800
I was surprised.

528
00:22:04,800 --> 00:22:06,800
I didn't know it was a collaboration.

529
00:22:06,800 --> 00:22:08,800
We're both pure.

530
00:22:08,800 --> 00:22:10,800
That's right.

531
00:22:10,800 --> 00:22:12,800
I didn't expect it to be a
collaboration.

532
00:22:12,800 --> 00:22:14,800
I didn't expect it to be a
collaboration.

533
00:22:14,800 --> 00:22:16,800
You're kind.

534
00:22:16,800 --> 00:22:18,800
I'm sorry I didn't ask you.

535
00:22:18,800 --> 00:22:20,800
But the first one was really good.

536
00:22:20,800 --> 00:22:22,800
I was listening to the recital.

537
00:22:22,800 --> 00:22:24,800
I was listening to the recital.

538
00:22:24,800 --> 00:22:26,800
I'm sorry, but I'm glad.

539
00:22:26,800 --> 00:22:28,800
But it was fun.

540
00:22:28,800 --> 00:22:30,800
I'm glad.

541
00:22:30,800 --> 00:22:32,800
Is this the end?

542
00:22:32,800 --> 00:22:34,800
Is this the end?

543
00:22:34,800 --> 00:22:36,800
But...

544
00:22:36,800 --> 00:22:38,800
From the fourth one,

545
00:22:38,800 --> 00:22:40,800
It was a prank.

546
00:22:40,800 --> 00:22:42,800
The first one was real.

547
00:22:42,800 --> 00:22:44,800
Everyone, check your shoulders.

548
00:22:44,800 --> 00:22:46,800
Check your shoulders.

549
00:22:46,800 --> 00:22:48,800
I hope you can do it together.

550
00:22:48,800 --> 00:22:50,800
I hope you can do it together.

551
00:22:50,800 --> 00:22:52,800
Thank you for watching.

552
00:22:52,800 --> 00:22:54,800
Thank you very much.

553
00:22:54,800 --> 00:22:56,800
Thank you very much.

554
00:22:56,800 --> 00:22:58,800
Please try it.

555
00:22:58,800 --> 00:23:02,800
Bye.
