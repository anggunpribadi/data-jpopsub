WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:02.000
 Now, it's started!

00:02.000 --> 00:05.000
 Tsukimeki Barometer, Joushou TV!

00:05.000 --> 00:07.000
 Yeah!

00:07.000 --> 00:09.000
 I'm so happy!

00:09.000 --> 00:14.000
 So, what are we doing this week?

00:14.000 --> 00:15.000
 Nami-tan!

00:15.000 --> 00:16.000
 Nami-tan!

00:16.000 --> 00:20.000
 This week, I've thought of something
recently.

00:20.000 --> 00:21.000
 Oh, what is it?

00:21.000 --> 00:34.000
 We want to be the person who can give
everyone a smile and courage by saying
the best words in any situation and any
place.

00:34.000 --> 00:36.000
 I've never thought of that.

00:36.000 --> 00:38.000
 I'm so excited!

00:38.000 --> 00:42.000
 This time, we're going to do this!

00:42.000 --> 00:43.000
 Yes!

00:43.000 --> 00:47.000
 The next is the word game!

00:47.000 --> 00:50.000
 Yeah!

00:50.000 --> 00:52.000
 It's important to say the best words.

00:52.000 --> 00:54.000
 It's important to say the best words.

00:54.000 --> 00:55.000
 Yes!

00:55.000 --> 01:03.000
 So, we've already said the best words
in any situation.

01:03.000 --> 01:05.000
 How do you feel?

01:05.000 --> 01:08.000
 I'm looking forward to seeing
everyone's.

01:08.000 --> 01:11.000
 I don't want to see myself.

01:11.000 --> 01:13.000
 I agree.

01:13.000 --> 01:18.000
 We're going to make a decision and
decide the winner of the Grand Prix.

01:18.000 --> 01:19.000
 Yes!

01:19.000 --> 01:26.000
 But, we have to give ourselves a score
to be fair to the winner of the Grand
Prix.

01:26.000 --> 01:27.000
 I see.

01:27.000 --> 01:28.000
 Yes.

01:28.000 --> 01:30.208
 Other members?

01:30.868 --> 01:32.868
 We are the Daisy's.

01:32.868 --> 01:35.608
 …No, wait…

01:37.968 --> 01:41.968
 This program is brought to you by
members who work to promote something
exciting

01:41.968 --> 02:11.448
 and challenge new things with their own
style.

02:14.744 --> 02:20.744
 The first challenge is to pick up the
handkerchiefs and say a word.

02:21.744 --> 02:25.744
 We'll see who can say the most.

02:26.744 --> 02:28.744
 The order is important.

02:32.744 --> 02:36.744
 The first person to show their
handkerchiefs will be the standard.

02:36.744 --> 02:39.744
 It's a difficult challenge.

02:40.744 --> 02:42.744
 Let's decide the order of rock-paper-
scissors.

02:42.744 --> 02:47.744
 Rock-paper-scissors

02:49.888 --> 02:52.688
 Tune in, tune in, to the happy ending

02:52.688 --> 02:54.688
 I knew it, I knew it, it's not going to
happen

02:55.896 --> 02:57.896
 Let's start with Julia.

02:57.896 --> 02:59.896
 What kind of situation is it?

03:00.896 --> 03:03.896
 Julia's situation is a situation where
she says,

03:04.896 --> 03:08.896
 Oh, I said it.

03:10.896 --> 03:14.896
 It's a common situation in the past.

03:15.896 --> 03:16.896
 Let's start.

03:17.896 --> 03:18.896
 Let's start.

03:18.896 --> 03:20.896
 Julia, please show us your real acting.

03:20.896 --> 03:21.896
 Yes.

03:21.896 --> 03:23.896
 Let's start.

03:29.978 --> 03:33.978
 I'm sorry, I dropped this.

03:36.978 --> 03:39.978
 You are a wonderful person.

03:39.978 --> 03:43.978
 I heard that you are in love.

03:45.978 --> 03:48.978
 Can I drop it next?

03:48.978 --> 03:55.616
 I'm in love with you.

03:56.616 --> 03:58.616
 You are good at this kind of thing.

04:01.616 --> 04:02.616
 Why don't you have confidence?

04:04.616 --> 04:05.616
 Because I'm a beginner.

04:05.616 --> 04:08.616
 Wow! You are good at this kind of
thing.

04:11.968 --> 04:13.968
 I'm going to start with Kanami.

04:13.968 --> 04:14.968
 5 points!

04:15.968 --> 04:16.968
 4 points!

04:16.968 --> 04:17.968
 5 points!

04:17.968 --> 04:18.968
 4 points!

04:18.968 --> 04:19.968
 5 points!

04:19.968 --> 04:20.968
 Wow!

04:20.968 --> 04:21.968
 It changed a lot.

04:21.968 --> 04:22.968
 Amazing!

04:22.968 --> 04:23.968
 Amazing!

04:23.968 --> 04:24.968
 Amazing!

04:25.968 --> 04:27.968
 I'm getting excited.

04:27.968 --> 04:28.968
 I'm getting excited.

04:28.968 --> 04:33.968
 I felt like something was missing.

04:35.752 --> 04:36.752
 I was like a tsunami.

04:37.752 --> 04:38.752
 Oh, I dropped a coin.

04:39.752 --> 04:40.752
 I dropped a coin.

04:43.752 --> 04:45.752
 I was like, can I drop it next?

04:46.752 --> 04:48.752
 I was like, can I drop it on purpose?

04:50.752 --> 04:52.752
 And I was like, can I drop it on the
coin?

04:52.752 --> 05:00.752
 I think I was able to sing this song in
a good way.

05:04.768 --> 05:06.768
 That's amazing.

05:06.768 --> 05:10.768
 So, Juri's score is 23!

05:12.768 --> 05:14.768
 That's the best score!

05:14.768 --> 05:15.768
 Right?

05:17.768 --> 05:19.768
 Next is Koki.

05:19.768 --> 05:21.768
 I'm a little nervous.

05:24.768 --> 05:25.768
 What's the situation?

05:25.768 --> 05:26.768
 The situation is...

05:26.768 --> 05:28.768
 A matching handkerchief!

05:30.768 --> 05:32.768
 VTR, start!

05:32.768 --> 05:35.768
 Juri 0-2 Koki

05:38.362 --> 05:42.362
 I dropped my handkerchief.

05:42.362 --> 05:44.362
 Let's play together.

05:53.362 --> 05:54.362
 Cute!

05:54.362 --> 05:56.362
 So funny!!!

06:00.656 --> 06:02.656
 I'll tell you the origin of the word.

06:03.656 --> 06:04.656
 Where is it from?

06:05.656 --> 06:07.656
 I thought it was from the word,
Guttekuru.

06:13.656 --> 06:17.656
 Please write your name on the chat.

06:23.656 --> 06:24.656
 I'll announce the score.

06:24.656 --> 06:25.656
 4 points.

06:26.656 --> 06:27.656
 3 points.

06:27.656 --> 06:28.784
 Thank you for your viewing.

06:29.784 --> 06:30.784
 4 points!

06:34.784 --> 06:38.784
 If I had another towel, I would have
got 5 points.

06:40.784 --> 06:42.784
 You are like a judge.

06:42.784 --> 06:52.784
 I laughed a lot.

06:52.784 --> 06:58.784
 I laughed a lot.

07:00.784 --> 07:04.784
 I was so cute.

07:05.784 --> 07:08.784
 I want you to do it in the anime.

07:08.784 --> 07:13.784
 I think you are good at setting.

07:14.784 --> 07:16.784
 You are wearing a suit.

07:17.784 --> 07:19.784
 You are young.

07:22.784 --> 07:27.784
 I want you to appear in my delusion.

07:27.784 --> 07:28.784
 Thank you.

07:30.784 --> 07:32.784
 Aki-chan got 17 points.

07:32.784 --> 07:34.784
 I got 17 points.

07:37.784 --> 07:40.784
 I am looking forward to it.

07:41.784 --> 07:43.784
 Let's use the fan.

07:44.784 --> 07:46.784
 The title is...

07:47.784 --> 07:51.784
 Don't forget to turn on the fan.

07:51.784 --> 07:57.784
 Let's start the virtual game.

08:02.042 --> 08:04.042
 Oh, excuse me.

08:05.042 --> 08:08.042
 Did you drop a gold handkerchief?

08:09.042 --> 08:11.042
 Or a silver handkerchief?

08:12.042 --> 08:17.042
 Or this pink handkerchief?

08:18.042 --> 08:19.042
 You are so lucky.

08:20.042 --> 08:23.042
 I will give you this pink handkerchief.

08:23.042 --> 08:31.042
 You are lucky from today.

08:31.834 --> 08:33.834
 That was great!

08:37.528 --> 08:38.528
 Here we go.

08:38.528 --> 08:39.528
 2 points!

08:39.528 --> 08:40.528
 1 point!

08:40.528 --> 08:41.528
 1 point!

08:41.528 --> 08:42.528
 3 points!

08:42.528 --> 08:43.528
 2 points!

08:44.528 --> 08:45.528
 So kind!

08:46.528 --> 08:48.528
 You're close to being a beginner.

08:48.528 --> 08:50.528
 I'm close to being a beginner.

08:51.528 --> 08:53.528
 By the way, what's the name of the
lake?

08:53.528 --> 08:54.528
 Lake?

08:55.528 --> 08:56.528
 Lake.

08:56.528 --> 08:57.528
 Lake.

08:58.528 --> 08:59.528
 Wow, that's amazing.

08:59.528 --> 09:00.528
 I have no idea.

09:01.528 --> 09:02.528
 I was wrong.

09:02.528 --> 09:05.528
 I said a famous line.

09:06.528 --> 09:09.528
 I've already looked it up.

09:10.528 --> 09:16.528
 I put a gold axe in the lake.

09:16.528 --> 09:19.528
 I put it in the lake.

09:19.528 --> 09:22.528
 And I made a cute smile.

09:23.528 --> 09:27.528
 I didn't have a gold handkerchief.

09:28.528 --> 09:29.528
 I didn't have a gold handkerchief.

09:29.528 --> 09:31.528
 I didn't have a pink handkerchief.

09:31.528 --> 09:34.528
 I didn't know the world view.

09:35.528 --> 09:37.528
 I didn't have a point.

09:37.528 --> 09:39.528
 I didn't know.

09:40.528 --> 09:42.528
 I'm sure you've heard this line.

09:43.528 --> 09:45.528
 I'm sure you've heard this line.

09:45.528 --> 09:50.528
 I thought I'd get something if I didn't
make a cute face.

09:54.528 --> 09:56.528
 I made a cute face.

09:56.528 --> 09:58.528
 I made a cute face.

09:58.528 --> 10:01.528
 I made a cute face.

10:01.528 --> 10:06.528
 I wanted to make a cute face at the
end.

10:07.528 --> 10:09.528
 I forced myself to make a cute face.

10:14.528 --> 10:15.528
 I'm sorry. I only gave you a point.

10:15.528 --> 10:16.528
 Thank you.

10:16.528 --> 10:17.528
 But, I gave you a point.

10:17.528 --> 10:18.528
 Yes.

10:18.528 --> 10:19.528
 Thank you.

10:19.528 --> 10:27.528
 I made a cute face at the end.

10:27.528 --> 10:30.528
 I thought that was a plus point.

10:30.528 --> 10:36.528
 And, I've never experienced a gold
handkerchief.

10:37.528 --> 10:43.528
 I thought that I'd have a good
experience if I appeared in the real
world.

10:43.528 --> 10:46.528
 I gave you a point.

10:46.528 --> 10:49.528
 You did well.

10:49.528 --> 10:51.528
 I got a good experience.

10:55.528 --> 10:58.528
 Your two hands look like Yuki Oharu's.

11:00.528 --> 11:01.528
 I agree.

11:01.528 --> 11:03.528
 I'll give you a point.

11:03.528 --> 11:11.968
 Oharu got 9 points.

11:12.968 --> 11:16.968
 The fourth person is me.

11:17.968 --> 11:19.968
 I'm Kanamin.

11:20.968 --> 11:21.968
 I'm...

11:25.968 --> 11:31.968
 I'm a senior at the same company.

11:31.968 --> 11:33.968
 But I have a junior.

11:34.968 --> 11:36.968
 So you're a junior.

11:36.968 --> 11:38.968
 I'm a senior at the same company.

11:39.968 --> 11:41.968
 I like you.

11:42.968 --> 11:44.968
 I think you'll be watching me.

11:45.968 --> 11:47.968
 I'm a senior at the same company.

11:48.968 --> 11:50.968
 I'm a senior at the same company.

11:50.968 --> 11:56.250
 I'm a junior at the same company.

11:56.250 --> 11:59.250
 Ah, excuse me. I dropped it.

12:00.250 --> 12:05.250
 Could you pick up my handkerchief and
my heart?

12:08.250 --> 12:09.250
 I see.

12:11.250 --> 12:13.250
 What is this feeling?

12:13.250 --> 12:14.250
 I wonder what it is.

12:18.250 --> 12:22.250
 Well, everyone, what do you think?

12:22.250 --> 12:23.984
 I love you.

12:24.984 --> 12:25.984
 3 points.

12:25.984 --> 12:26.984
 3 points.

12:26.984 --> 12:27.984
 3 points.

12:27.984 --> 12:28.984
 3 points.

12:30.984 --> 12:36.984
 I think she was quite bold.

12:38.984 --> 12:41.984
 I want to ask you again.

12:41.984 --> 12:45.984
 I think it's like a manga title.

12:45.984 --> 12:46.984
 That's right.

12:46.984 --> 12:57.984
 I think it's cute because it's
overlapped with the title of the manga.

12:57.984 --> 13:03.984
 Yes, so the score is 14 points.

13:03.984 --> 13:05.984
 14 points is a lot.

13:05.984 --> 13:07.984
 14 points is amazing.

13:07.984 --> 13:09.984
 Next, Kana.

13:09.984 --> 13:13.984
 Yes, next, I'm very similar to various
things.

13:13.984 --> 13:16.984
 Kana is good.

13:16.984 --> 13:19.984
 I'm not good at it.

13:19.984 --> 13:21.984
 I'm not good at it.

13:21.984 --> 13:24.984
 I'm just making a bad impression.

13:24.984 --> 13:27.984
 I'm the same as Chonba Karami.

13:27.984 --> 13:34.984
 I'm the same as her, but I have a
senior who I'm interested in.

13:34.984 --> 13:40.984
 I can't be brave at all and I can't
always speak.

13:40.984 --> 13:44.984
 I dropped my handkerchief and I did my
best.

13:44.984 --> 13:46.984
 I'm the one who said I did my best.

13:46.984 --> 13:47.984
 I see.

13:47.984 --> 13:49.984
 I'm a little bad.

13:49.984 --> 13:50.984
 I'm not good at it.

13:50.984 --> 13:51.984
 I'm not good at it.

13:51.984 --> 13:52.984
 I'm not good at it.

13:52.984 --> 13:56.984
 But I did my best, so please watch the
video.

13:56.984 --> 14:02.714
 Please watch the video.

14:02.714 --> 14:07.714
 Senpai, I dropped my handkerchief.

14:07.714 --> 14:12.714
 This handkerchief is also very cute.

14:12.714 --> 14:17.714
 If you don't mind, can I have the same
one?

14:17.714 --> 14:19.714
 Hmm...

14:23.714 --> 14:25.714
 It's cute.

14:25.714 --> 14:26.714
 I like it.

14:26.714 --> 14:28.144
 I'm happy.

14:29.144 --> 14:31.144
 I think it's the world.

14:31.144 --> 14:33.144
 I wanted to match.

14:33.144 --> 14:36.144
 But I couldn't say that I wanted to
match.

14:36.144 --> 14:38.144
 Matching is a high level.

14:38.144 --> 14:40.144
 I couldn't say that I wanted to match,
but I wanted to match.

14:40.144 --> 14:42.144
 That's why I wrote the same thing.

14:42.144 --> 14:43.144
 I see.

14:43.144 --> 14:47.144
 It's like a girl who's usually light-
hearted has a lot of courage.

14:47.144 --> 14:49.144
 Where do you want to match with me?

14:49.144 --> 14:51.144
 I want to match.

14:52.144 --> 14:53.144
 Aki-chan, do you want to match?

14:53.144 --> 14:54.144
 We're matching.

14:54.144 --> 14:55.144
 Oh, I see.

14:55.144 --> 14:59.144
 Aki-chan, you're not a girl who's
usually light-hearted.

14:59.144 --> 15:00.144
 I'm sorry.

15:00.144 --> 15:01.144
 I'm sorry.

15:01.144 --> 15:02.144
 I'm sorry.

15:02.144 --> 15:08.272
 Thank you for watching.

15:08.272 --> 15:10.272
 I'll go.

15:10.272 --> 15:11.272
 2 points.

15:11.272 --> 15:12.272
 4 points.

15:13.272 --> 15:14.272
 4 points.

15:14.272 --> 15:15.272
 4 points.

15:15.272 --> 15:16.272
 4 points.

15:16.272 --> 15:17.272
 3 points.

15:19.272 --> 15:25.272
 I thought it was good when Yusha-chan
gave me 17 points.

15:25.272 --> 15:33.272
 I was able to get in to the top 10.

15:34.760 --> 15:35.760
 Thank you.

15:37.760 --> 15:46.760
 I also felt like I saw a feminine side
of Hitoka.

15:47.760 --> 15:50.760
 I was glad to see that.

15:51.760 --> 15:52.760
 I'm glad.

15:52.760 --> 16:01.760
 I think the men's side is cute, but I
got minus 2 points.

16:02.760 --> 16:05.760
 I thought it was a horse, not a cat.

16:06.760 --> 16:11.760
 I thought it was a horse, but I got
minus 2 points.

16:12.760 --> 16:13.760
 I see.

16:14.760 --> 16:15.760
 Julia is good.

16:16.760 --> 16:17.760
 Hitoka got 19 points.

16:17.760 --> 16:18.760
 I got minus 2 points.

16:20.760 --> 16:21.760
 The last one.

16:22.760 --> 16:23.760
 Yui.

16:24.760 --> 16:35.760
 Yui's situation is a fashionable girl
who is going to a shopping mall.

16:38.760 --> 16:40.760
 Let's see the video.

16:40.760 --> 16:46.042
 Yui's situation is a fashionable girl
who is going to a shopping mall.

16:46.042 --> 16:48.042
 Um...

16:48.042 --> 16:51.042
 I dropped this.

16:51.042 --> 16:55.042
 I'm in the movie theater.

16:55.042 --> 16:59.042
 I'm playing a movie called Happy Yellow
Handkerchief.

16:59.042 --> 17:04.042
 Do you want to see it and have a love
like Hanatawa?

17:08.042 --> 17:10.042
 I'm so happy.

17:10.042 --> 17:12.634
 Thank you for watching.

17:12.634 --> 17:14.634
 I'm a man.

17:14.634 --> 17:16.634
 No, I'm not.

17:16.634 --> 17:18.634
 I didn't know that.

17:18.634 --> 17:20.634
 Until I saw everyone,

17:20.634 --> 17:26.634
 I only had the concept of a man.

17:26.634 --> 17:28.634
 Did you say you were a man?

17:28.634 --> 17:30.634
 Yes.

17:30.634 --> 17:35.634
 I didn't have the concept of playing a
role of a woman.

17:35.634 --> 17:37.634
 I saw everyone and thought,

17:37.634 --> 17:42.634
 Everyone is playing the role of a
woman.

17:43.802 --> 17:45.802
 Let's go!

17:45.802 --> 17:47.802
 Here we go!

17:47.802 --> 17:48.802
 3 points!

17:48.802 --> 17:49.802
 2 points!

17:49.802 --> 17:50.802
 1 point!

17:52.802 --> 17:54.802
 You're quite a talker.

17:55.802 --> 17:57.802
 I've seen you in movies 3 times.

17:57.802 --> 17:59.802
 I thought you were a really good
talker.

18:00.802 --> 18:02.802
 We've met before.

18:02.802 --> 18:06.802
 I've seen you in movies before and
recently.

18:06.802 --> 18:14.802
 I'm sorry to say this but I was a bit
scared when you suddenly came to me.

18:14.802 --> 18:16.802
 So I'll give you a minus point.

18:17.802 --> 18:21.802
 You were in a dangerous situation.

18:21.802 --> 18:23.802
 I was a bit scared.

18:23.802 --> 18:24.802
 I was a bit...

18:24.802 --> 18:26.802
 You're a talker.

18:27.802 --> 18:28.802
 I'll give you a point.

18:29.802 --> 18:32.802
 You were cool so I'll give you a point.

18:32.802 --> 18:35.802
 But I was a bit scared.

18:35.802 --> 18:37.802
 You had a kind smile.

18:38.802 --> 18:40.802
 I was a bit scared.

18:40.802 --> 18:41.802
 You got used to it.

18:41.802 --> 18:42.802
 Aki-chan, what about you?

18:42.802 --> 18:43.802
 I'll give you a point.

18:44.802 --> 18:48.802
 You were so cute when you appeared.

18:48.802 --> 18:51.802
 I felt like I was going to die.

18:52.802 --> 18:55.802
 I thought you were a talker.

18:55.802 --> 19:01.802
 And you were a bit cute when you did
the wave.

19:01.802 --> 19:02.802
 Thank you.

19:02.802 --> 19:03.802
 I'll give you a point.

19:05.802 --> 19:09.802
 So, 9 people got 12 points.

19:12.802 --> 19:14.802
 I was able to get rid of the genie.

19:16.802 --> 19:17.802
 It's not over yet.

19:20.802 --> 19:22.802
 The genie will come to this
competition.

19:22.802 --> 19:28.720

19:33.328 --> 19:35.328
 Let's move on to the second round.

19:36.328 --> 19:39.328
 Next is the one when you beat the Demon
King.

19:42.328 --> 19:45.328
 Next is the one when you beat the Demon
King.

19:45.328 --> 19:46.328
 This is crazy.

19:46.328 --> 19:48.328
 I'm also in trouble.

19:48.328 --> 19:50.328
 Everyone is in trouble.

19:50.328 --> 19:51.328
 This is crazy.

19:51.328 --> 19:52.328
 I'm scared.

19:52.328 --> 19:54.328
 There are people who are looking
forward to it.

19:54.328 --> 19:57.328
 I can hear it from the side.

19:57.328 --> 19:59.328
 I want to go to the front.

19:59.328 --> 20:03.232
 Please subscribe to my channel.

20:03.232 --> 20:06.232
 Please like and subscribe to my
channel.

20:27.610 --> 20:33.010
 I want to share my feelings with you

20:33.770 --> 20:37.850
 There's still a view I've never seen
before

20:37.850 --> 20:41.890
 Come on, let's go anywhere

20:44.180 --> 20:46.180
 Goodbye, goodbye

20:46.180 --> 20:48.180
 Thank you for yesterday

20:48.180 --> 20:52.180
 The city after the rain is colorful

20:52.180 --> 20:54.180
 On the canvas of my damaged heart

20:54.180 --> 20:56.180
 I'll draw a fragment of the future

20:56.180 --> 21:00.180
 It will guide me

21:16.442 --> 21:21.442
 Now I can say the reason for my tears

21:21.442 --> 21:25.442
 When I'm lost, I remember right away

21:25.442 --> 21:29.442
 Even if it rains, I'll smile

21:29.442 --> 21:33.442
 Look, let's go anywhere

21:33.442 --> 21:37.442
 Goodbye, goodbye, to me of yesterday

21:37.442 --> 21:41.442
 The city lights after the rain are
sparkling

21:41.442 --> 21:45.442
 My heart is like a sunny day, the sound
of the rain drops is ringing

21:45.442 --> 21:49.442
 I play the rainbow piano

21:49.442 --> 21:54.442
 Goodbye, goodbye, to me of yesterday

21:54.442 --> 21:58.442
 The city lights after the rain are
sparkling

21:58.442 --> 22:02.442
 My heart is like a sunny day, the sound
of the rain drops is ringing

22:02.442 --> 22:26.442
 I wear a rainbow dress
