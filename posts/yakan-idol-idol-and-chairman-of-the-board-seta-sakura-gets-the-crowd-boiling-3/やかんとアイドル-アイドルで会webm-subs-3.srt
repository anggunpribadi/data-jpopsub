00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,000
That's a long time ago.

4
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:20,000
The first time I touched a game was when
I was 4 years old.

5
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:21,000
That's early!

6
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:27,000
Nintendo's Wii was the first game I
played.

7
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:31,000
I've liked games since I was little.

8
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:33,000

00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:47,000
Do you communicate with each other
online?

00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:51,000
Yes, I do it with my friends in the
game.

13
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:54,000
I also do it alone.

14
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:59,000
Do you have a special account?

15
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:01,000
I don't know.

16
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:05,000
I don't have a special account.

17
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:10,000
I don't have a special account.

18
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:15,000
I don't have a special account.

19
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,000
I have to tell you that.

20
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:21,000
I'm into games.

21
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:28,000
I don't have a special account.

22
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:31,000

Do you know your gender?

24
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:37,000
I don't know my gender.

25
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:41,000
I don't know my gender.

26
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:46,000
I don't know my gender.

27
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:53,000
I don't want people to think I'm a girl.

28
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:57,000
I don't want people to think I'm a girl.

29
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:01,000
That's an extra thing to do when you
play games.

30
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:06,000
I just want to play games.

31
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:11,000
I'm completely alone in my private life.

32
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:16,000
I'm in this game to enjoy it.

33
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:21,000
I'm in this game to enjoy it.

34
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:24,000
Do you watch anime?

35
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:27,000
I watch anime.

36
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:31,000
I've been watching anime for a long
time.

37
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:36,000
I haven't said it, but I've been
watching a lot of anime since I was in
middle school.

38
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:39,000
Why do you like anime?

39
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:44,000
I like cute girls.

40
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:49,000
I'm an otaku.

41
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:54,000
I like the color of the hair and eyes
that are not realistic.

42
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:57,000
I like the color of the hair and eyes
that are not realistic.

43
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:01,000
I like the voice and the appearance of
the characters.

44
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,000
I admire them.

45
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:07,000
I've always liked pre-cure since I was a
kid.

47
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
I get energy from anime.

48
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:18,000
Can you tell me your favorite anime?

49
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:26,000
I like the anime called Isekai Seikatsu.

50
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:33,000
Do you think you can appear in an anime
as a voice actor?

51
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,000
I don't have to appear in an anime.

52
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:41,000
I want to appear in an anime.

53
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:47,000
Voice actors are great professionals.

54
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:51,000
I don't think I can be in the anime.

55
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:54,000
It's a painful story.

56
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:58,000
I want to be a voice actor.

57
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:08,000
I think it's better for professionals to
appear in an anime.

58
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
I think it's good.

59
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:20,000
I want to be a voice actor in Kyushu.

60
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:24,000
I would be happy if I could be a voice
actor.

61
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,000
I see.

62
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:31,000
I want to see Seta without a limiter.

63
00:04:31,000 --> 00:05:00,000
I'm often told that I'm different from
Seta.
