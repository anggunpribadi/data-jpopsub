Today We came to see the product from Nanaemon Kiln! !

Located in Yamagata City, Yamagata Prefecture, with a history of about 200 years.
Produced by Shichiemon Kiln, one of the kilns that continues to preserve the tradition of Hirashimizu ware! !

[We](/artist/iginari-tohoku-san/) create charming folk pottery using pottery stone containing iron sulfide from the local Chitose Mountains!

At Shichiemon Kiln, you can enjoy pottery making and painting experiences!

Today we will try our hand at pottery made by Nanaemon Kiln! !
What kind of thing will be completed?
