1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Ebichu's videos!

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,000
Ebichu Haru Tour goods!

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,000
What kind of goods are there?

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:17,000
This time, I will introduce each of them
one by one.

5
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:21,000
First, this drawer T-shirt.

6
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:24,000
We are wearing it now.

7
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:31,000
This is the smallest size.

8
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:34,000
You can wear it as many times as you
want.

9
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:35,000
What?

10
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:37,000
I can't wear it as many times as I want.

11
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:40,000
You can't wear it as many times as you
want.

12
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
It's a good size.

13
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
3700 yen.

14
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:48,000
How do you feel?

15
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:54,000
It's comfortable to wear. It's easy to
wear.

16
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:58,000
You can wear it in this season and in
the summer.

17
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:03,000
I'm wearing a white shirt today.

18
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:07,000
It's a cream color.

19
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:11,000
It's better to wear it than a white
T-shirt.

20
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:14,000
The back is also cute.

21
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:18,000
Each member color and the back logo are
written on it.

22
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:28,000
This T-shirt is also painted in the
member color.

23
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:36,000
This T-shirt and Ebichu's live
performance are not in the same place.

24
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:40,000
I think it's a T-shirt that will remain
in my memory.

25
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:47,000
I hope you can get it as a memory of the
2020 DRAWER.

26
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:54,000
Next is the DRAWER TURL.

27
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:58,000
This is also a T-shirt with the same
design.

28
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
It's smooth.

29
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:04,000
The fabric is very good.

30
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:08,000
I think it's cute.

31
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:12,000
It's cute.

32
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:17,000
What kind of life do you want to use
this for?

33
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:23,000
I want to decorate my room.

34
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:28,000
It's similar to clothes, so I want to
wear it with clothes.

35
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
It's cute.

36
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:30,306
Thank you for your viewing.

37
00:02:30,306 --> 00:02:32,306
It's cute.

38
00:02:32,306 --> 00:02:34,306
Do you have a good way to wrap it?

39
00:02:34,306 --> 00:02:36,306
What?

40
00:02:36,306 --> 00:02:38,306
What is it?

41
00:02:38,306 --> 00:02:40,306
How do you do it?

42
00:02:42,306 --> 00:02:44,306
It's good.

43
00:02:44,306 --> 00:02:46,306
It's like a shrimp-shaped tube.

44
00:02:48,306 --> 00:02:50,306
Like this.

45
00:02:50,306 --> 00:02:45,226
It's a

46
00:02:52,306 --> 00:02:54,306
NONOGA.

47
00:02:54,306 --> 00:02:56,306
I can't put my hands out yet.

48
00:02:56,306 --> 00:02:58,306
Please use this.

49
00:02:58,306 --> 00:03:00,306
Please use it as a support.

50
00:03:00,306 --> 00:03:02,306
Please use it as a support.

51
00:03:02,306 --> 00:03:04,306
Is it done?

52
00:03:04,306 --> 00:03:06,306
I'm sorry.

53
00:03:06,306 --> 00:03:08,306
Some members

54
00:03:08,306 --> 00:03:10,306
have towels

55
00:03:10,306 --> 00:03:12,306
in the production room.

56
00:03:12,306 --> 00:03:14,306
I'm surprised.

57
00:03:14,306 --> 00:03:16,306
I'm surprised.

58
00:03:16,306 --> 00:03:18,306
I'm always sweating in the tour.

59
00:03:18,306 --> 00:03:20,306
Everyone

60
00:03:20,306 --> 00:03:22,306
is sweating

61
00:03:22,306 --> 00:03:24,306
with the same towel

62
00:03:24,306 --> 00:03:26,306
that we enjoyed the live performance
together.

63
00:03:26,306 --> 00:03:28,306
Please use it

64
00:03:28,306 --> 00:03:30,306
as a support.

65
00:03:32,306 --> 00:03:34,306
Next,

66
00:03:34,306 --> 00:03:36,306
we'll use this

67
00:03:36,306 --> 00:03:38,306
enchantment light.

68
00:03:38,306 --> 00:03:40,306
The pattern is

69
00:03:40,306 --> 00:03:42,306
the same.

70
00:03:42,306 --> 00:03:44,306
It's cute.

71
00:03:48,306 --> 00:03:50,306
Green

72
00:03:50,306 --> 00:03:52,306
orange

73
00:03:52,306 --> 00:03:54,306
yellow

74
00:03:54,306 --> 00:03:56,306
green

75
00:03:56,306 --> 00:03:58,306
red

76
00:03:58,306 --> 00:04:00,306
white

77
00:04:00,306 --> 00:04:02,306
blue

78
00:04:02,306 --> 00:04:04,306
and

79
00:04:04,306 --> 00:04:06,306
red.

80
00:04:06,306 --> 00:04:08,306
After the

81
00:04:08,306 --> 00:04:10,306
9 members,

82
00:04:10,306 --> 00:04:12,306
we still have

83
00:04:12,306 --> 00:04:14,306
a few pens

84
00:04:14,306 --> 00:04:16,306
so we're happy.

85
00:04:16,306 --> 00:04:18,306
Please buy it.

86
00:04:18,306 --> 00:04:20,306
If you can choose

87
00:04:20,306 --> 00:04:22,306
any color,

88
00:04:22,306 --> 00:04:24,306
what would it be?

89
00:04:24,306 --> 00:04:26,306
I like

90
00:04:26,306 --> 00:04:28,306
yellow.

91
00:04:28,306 --> 00:04:30,306
I like yellow.

92
00:04:30,306 --> 00:04:32,306
I like

93
00:04:32,306 --> 00:04:34,306
light yellow.

94
00:04:34,306 --> 00:04:36,306
I like

95
00:04:36,306 --> 00:04:38,306
yellow.

96
00:04:38,306 --> 00:04:40,306
If I could choose,

97
00:04:40,306 --> 00:04:42,306
I would like to buy

98
00:04:42,306 --> 00:04:44,306
yellow.

99
00:04:44,306 --> 00:04:46,306
What color would you like to buy?

100
00:04:46,306 --> 00:04:48,306
I like

101
00:04:48,306 --> 00:04:50,306
pink.

102
00:04:50,306 --> 00:04:52,306
When I was in elementary school,

103
00:04:52,306 --> 00:04:54,306
I was told that I liked pink.

104
00:04:54,306 --> 00:04:56,306
I was told that I liked pink.

105
00:04:56,306 --> 00:04:58,306
I was happy

106
00:04:58,306 --> 00:05:00,306
when I got pink.

107
00:05:00,306 --> 00:05:02,306
I like white.

108
00:05:02,306 --> 00:05:04,306
I like everything.

109
00:05:04,306 --> 00:05:06,306
I think

110
00:05:06,306 --> 00:05:08,306
everyone is curious about

111
00:05:08,306 --> 00:05:10,306
what color they like.

112
00:05:10,306 --> 00:05:12,306
I like the color

113
00:05:12,306 --> 00:05:14,306
of the members.

114
00:05:14,306 --> 00:05:16,306
I like white.

115
00:05:16,306 --> 00:05:18,306
I think white is the right color.

116
00:05:18,306 --> 00:05:20,306
I was scared.

117
00:05:20,306 --> 00:05:22,306
I really hated purple.

118
00:05:22,306 --> 00:05:24,306
I was like,

119
00:05:24,306 --> 00:05:26,306
purple?

120
00:05:26,306 --> 00:05:28,306
I was like that.

121
00:05:28,306 --> 00:05:30,306
But I like the members

122
00:05:30,306 --> 00:05:32,898
of the group.

123
00:05:32,898 --> 00:05:35,898
So please take care of your health.

124
00:05:35,898 --> 00:05:40,898
Please cheer for us with this 9 and 10.

125
00:05:40,898 --> 00:05:45,898
Next, we would like to introduce the
10th Anniversary Band.

126
00:05:45,898 --> 00:05:48,898
It's a member-colored hit band.

127
00:05:48,898 --> 00:05:51,898
All 10 songs are out.

128
00:05:51,898 --> 00:05:55,898
You can see everyone's love during the
live.

129
00:05:55,898 --> 00:06:02,898
They help us with the old stuff.

130
00:06:02,898 --> 00:06:05,898
It's like a history book.

131
00:06:05,898 --> 00:06:10,898
Next, we would like to introduce the
Elytus Smartphone Straps.

132
00:06:10,898 --> 00:06:11,898
It's cute.

133
00:06:11,898 --> 00:06:13,898
The color is really cute.

134
00:06:13,898 --> 00:06:16,898
It's like a rope.

135
00:06:16,898 --> 00:06:19,898
It's really sturdy.

136
00:06:19,898 --> 00:06:24,898
It's not thin, so it won't stick to your
neck.

137
00:06:24,898 --> 00:06:26,898
It doesn't hurt, right?

138
00:06:26,898 --> 00:06:29,898
It's a good thing.

139
00:06:29,898 --> 00:06:31,898
I'm going to use this.

140
00:06:31,898 --> 00:06:33,898
I'm losing my phone.

141
00:06:33,898 --> 00:06:36,898
I've been losing it a lot lately.

142
00:06:36,898 --> 00:06:40,898
I've been asked to search for various
products.

143
00:06:40,898 --> 00:06:42,898
I'm going to use this from today.

144
00:06:42,898 --> 00:06:45,898
I'm not going to use it because it's
old.

145
00:06:45,898 --> 00:06:50,898
I put my smartphone on the bed at home.

146
00:06:50,898 --> 00:06:54,898
I'm going to use it for a day.

147
00:06:54,898 --> 00:06:56,898
It's not going to work even if I ring
the phone.

148
00:06:56,898 --> 00:06:58,898
I'm tired.

149
00:06:58,898 --> 00:07:00,898
I'm tired for a day.

150
00:07:00,898 --> 00:07:02,898
I'm tired for a day.

151
00:07:02,898 --> 00:07:04,898
I'm going to sleep.

152
00:07:04,898 --> 00:07:06,898
You're always doing your best.

153
00:07:06,898 --> 00:07:11,898
I'm going to sleep, so I'm going to
sleep.

154
00:07:11,898 --> 00:07:21,898
I feel like the space of the music room
has been broken down.

155
00:07:21,898 --> 00:07:26,898
I think I've been doing a lot of things.

156
00:07:26,898 --> 00:07:28,898
I'm doing the same with Yuna.

157
00:07:28,898 --> 00:07:30,898
Yuna is crying a lot.

158
00:07:30,898 --> 00:07:34,898
I'm going to make a desk that's
surrounded by my desk.

159
00:07:34,898 --> 00:07:36,898
I'm going to make a desk.

160
00:07:36,898 --> 00:07:38,898
I'm going to make a desk.

161
00:07:38,898 --> 00:07:42,898
I'm living here, but I'm going to spread
it around here.

162
00:07:42,898 --> 00:07:46,898
I can't say it because I'm tired.

163
00:07:46,898 --> 00:07:51,898
Let's use this to organize things.

164
00:07:51,898 --> 00:07:55,898
This is a table.

165
00:07:55,898 --> 00:08:00,898
This is the table that I always use.

166
00:08:00,898 --> 00:08:05,898
This is the table that other members
use.

167
00:08:05,898 --> 00:08:11,898
Let's open this and assemble it.

168
00:08:11,898 --> 00:08:16,098
The surroundings are cute.

169
00:08:16,098 --> 00:08:17,098
Like this.

170
00:08:17,938 --> 00:08:23,298
And there's a key holder for the strap.

171
00:08:23,478 --> 00:08:28,578
And there's a name on the key holder.

172
00:08:29,218 --> 00:08:30,218
Yes.

173
00:08:30,578 --> 00:08:31,578
Like this.

174
00:08:31,578 --> 00:08:32,578
It's cute.

175
00:08:33,058 --> 00:08:36,818
You can wear it as a charm.

176
00:08:37,278 --> 00:08:39,058
Or you can stand it up.

177
00:08:39,058 --> 00:08:40,058
Yes.

178
00:08:40,258 --> 00:08:44,098
It's cute. You can put it on your belly.

179
00:08:44,098 --> 00:08:45,098
It's cute.

180
00:08:45,098 --> 00:08:46,098
It's cute.

181
00:08:46,098 --> 00:08:47,098
It's cute.

182
00:08:47,098 --> 00:08:48,098
It's cute.

183
00:08:49,098 --> 00:08:51,098
Let's do rock-paper-scissors.

184
00:08:51,098 --> 00:08:52,098
Yes.

185
00:08:52,098 --> 00:08:53,098
Ready?

186
00:08:53,098 --> 00:08:54,098
Start!

187
00:08:54,098 --> 00:08:57,098
Rock-paper-scissors!

188
00:08:57,098 --> 00:08:59,098
Yes!

189

You can play with your own hands.

210
00:09:45,098 --> 00:09:51,098
How about playing with your family
members?

211
00:09:51,098 --> 00:09:57,098
You can get your favorite member for
1,500 yen.

212

213
00:10:00,098 --> 00:10:05,098
Next, we have two colors, elitite and
black.

214
00:10:05,098 --> 00:10:07,098
The color is beige.

215
00:10:07,098 --> 00:10:12,098
I got two colors, and they cost 3,800
yen.

216
00:10:12,098 --> 00:10:14,098
It's so solid!

217
00:10:14,098 --> 00:10:16,098
It's really solid.

218
00:10:16,098 --> 00:10:19,098
It matches well.

219
00:10:19,098 --> 00:10:21,098
It has pockets inside.

220
00:10:21,098 --> 00:10:22,098

You might get confused when you buy it.

224
00:10:27,098 --> 00:10:29,098
It's really solid.

225
00:10:29,098 --> 00:10:34,098

226
00:10:34,098 --> 00:10:36,098
It's cute.

227
00:10:36,098 --> 00:10:40,098
The main character of Egi-chu is not so
much.

228
00:10:40,098 --> 00:10:42,098
It's useful for daily use.

229
00:10:42,098 --> 00:10:49,098
You can use it for your daily life.

230
00:10:49,098 --> 00:10:52,098
