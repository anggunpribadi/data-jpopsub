1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,200
The members' individuality explodes!

2
00:00:03,200 --> 00:00:06,200
Ebichutas Fashion, the second half of
the game!

3
00:00:06,200 --> 00:00:08,200
I'm going to eat some potatoes.

4
00:00:08,200 --> 00:00:15,200
Coordination battle between members with
serious shopping!

5
00:00:15,200 --> 00:00:18,200
Transform into a curry at the fashion
show!

6
00:00:18,200 --> 00:00:20,200
It's different from usual.

7
00:00:20,200 --> 00:00:23,200
Ebichutas-tas, start!

8
00:00:23,200 --> 00:00:25,200
Do you understand?

9
00:00:25,200 --> 00:00:30,200
Ebichutas Fashion

10
00:00:55,200 --> 00:00:58,200
The second half of the game!

11
00:00:58,200 --> 00:01:03,200
Ebichutas-tas, start!

12
00:01:03,200 --> 00:01:07,994
Ebichutas-tas, start!

13
00:01:07,994 --> 00:01:11,994
Add various things to private Ebisu
Middle School!

14
00:01:11,994 --> 00:01:14,994
Ebisu Justice!

15
00:01:14,994 --> 00:01:31,610
This program is brought to you by these
sponsors.

16
00:01:31,610 --> 00:01:36,610
The second half of the Coordination
Battle, which is held at the Diversity
Tokyo Plaza.

17
00:01:37,610 --> 00:01:42,610
The four teams are divided into pairs
and each team coordinates each other.

18
00:01:42,610 --> 00:01:46,610
The winning team will be presented with
the clothes they chose.

19
00:01:47,610 --> 00:01:52,610
Last time, these two teams finished
shopping with this theme.

20
00:01:55,610 --> 00:01:58,610
And this time, the second half team's
challenge.

21
00:01:58,610 --> 00:02:02,610
First, let's talk about the theme of the
coordination.

22
00:02:03,610 --> 00:02:04,610
Let's start with the C team.

23
00:02:04,610 --> 00:02:07,610
I want to make it look like an adult.

24
00:02:07,610 --> 00:02:14,610
Kaho is a forest girl, so I want to put
together the clothes in black.

25
00:02:14,610 --> 00:02:16,610
I've always wanted to do that.

26
00:02:16,610 --> 00:02:19,610
And Kobayashi's usual clothes?

27
00:02:20,610 --> 00:02:21,610
One, two.

28
00:02:21,610 --> 00:02:28,610
I want to be in the forest, so I want to
be like a boy who looks like a boy in
the forest.

29
00:02:28,610 --> 00:02:30,610
That's not a forest, it's a park.

30
00:02:30,610 --> 00:02:32,610
I'm a balloon man.

31
00:02:33,610 --> 00:02:36,610
Kobayashi's theme, which is like a
balloon craftsman.

32
00:02:38,610 --> 00:02:40,610
A balloon man.

33
00:02:41,610 --> 00:02:44,610
I see. So one balloon will be
misaligned.

34
00:02:44,610 --> 00:02:53,610
Next, Yasumoto. Her clothes are also
balloon craftsman like Kobayashi.

35
00:02:53,610 --> 00:02:55,610
The theme is...

36
00:02:56,610 --> 00:02:57,610
Yasumoto, let's go.

37
00:02:58,610 --> 00:03:00,610
A balloon man.

38
00:03:00,610 --> 00:03:01,610
Excuse me.

39
00:03:02,610 --> 00:03:03,610
That's right.

40
00:03:03,610 --> 00:03:04,610
It's a new style.

41
00:03:04,610 --> 00:03:05,610
I want to finish it.

42
00:03:06,610 --> 00:03:08,610
It's the last one, but let's finish it.

43
00:03:08,610 --> 00:03:10,610
A pop and playful coordination.

44
00:03:11,610 --> 00:03:13,610
That's a good word.

45
00:03:13,610 --> 00:03:15,610
A pop and playful coordination.

46
00:03:15,610 --> 00:03:17,610
I want to add a lot of colors.

47
00:03:18,610 --> 00:03:20,610
This is going to be a summer balloon.

48
00:03:20,610 --> 00:03:22,610
Summer balloon?

49
00:03:23,610 --> 00:03:25,610
It's going to be a summer balloon.

50
00:03:25,610 --> 00:03:30,610
Will the balloon code be the key to the
game in the second half?

51
00:03:31,610 --> 00:03:34,610
The budget is 30,000 yen for the fair.

52
00:03:34,610 --> 00:03:37,610
Let's start shopping.

53
00:03:37,610 --> 00:03:43,610
First, the C team went to find the
clothes that match the theme.

54
00:03:44,610 --> 00:03:45,610
Can you see the E-hive?

55
00:03:45,610 --> 00:03:47,610
I can see it. Which one?

56
00:03:47,610 --> 00:03:50,426
Which one?

57
00:03:50,426 --> 00:03:56,426
E-Hype World Gallery is a casual brand
that is conscious of European culture

58
00:03:58,426 --> 00:03:59,426
Kawaki is cute

59
00:03:59,426 --> 00:04:00,426
This is cute

60
00:04:00,426 --> 00:04:01,426
Cute

61
00:04:03,426 --> 00:04:04,426
What about black?

62
00:04:04,426 --> 00:04:05,426
Cute

63
00:04:05,426 --> 00:04:08,666
E-Hype World Gallery

64
00:04:08,666 --> 00:04:10,666
I'll choose check

65
00:04:10,666 --> 00:04:12,666
Check 9

66
00:04:12,666 --> 00:04:16,666
Check pattern that can not be missed in
balloon code

67
00:04:16,666 --> 00:04:20,666
While the balloon is progressing
steadily

68
00:04:20,666 --> 00:04:24,666
Looking for clothes to express mature
Kobayashi

69
00:04:24,666 --> 00:04:26,666
Same

70
00:04:26,666 --> 00:04:30,666
First, choose a popular long cardigan

71
00:04:30,666 --> 00:04:32,666
I hate it

72
00:04:32,666 --> 00:04:34,666
Mom was looking

73
00:04:34,666 --> 00:04:38,666
What is this? Cardigan?

74
00:04:38,666 --> 00:04:40,666
It's warm

75
00:04:40,666 --> 00:04:44,666
Kobayashi, which is warmer than it looks

76
00:04:44,666 --> 00:04:46,666
How to finish

77
00:04:46,666 --> 00:04:50,666
The two of the D team are

78
00:04:50,666 --> 00:04:52,666
It seems to be a lot

79
00:04:52,666 --> 00:04:56,666
We go to Wigo, which often goes from
Fulan

80
00:04:56,666 --> 00:05:00,666
I don't know what to choose

81
00:05:00,666 --> 00:05:02,666
This is men's

82
00:05:02,666 --> 00:05:08,666
I think it's cute if a girl wears men's

83
00:05:08,666 --> 00:05:10,666
Moe

84
00:05:10,666 --> 00:05:12,666
It's a catch

85
00:05:12,666 --> 00:05:16,666
Let's make a decision

86
00:05:16,666 --> 00:05:18,666
Have you decided?

87
00:05:18,666 --> 00:05:20,666
I decided

88
00:05:20,666 --> 00:05:24,666
Yasumoto, who is also in the balloon
code

89
00:05:24,666 --> 00:05:26,666
On the other hand, Kashiwagi

90
00:05:26,666 --> 00:05:28,666
Wait

91
00:05:28,666 --> 00:05:32,666
I said it was a pop, but it seems to be
a pop

92
00:05:32,666 --> 00:05:36,666
I'm struggling with the pop theme I
chose

93
00:05:36,666 --> 00:05:38,666
I'm really in a hurry

94
00:05:38,666 --> 00:05:44,666
At that time, the C team

95
00:05:44,666 --> 00:05:46,666
Which one is better?

96
00:05:46,666 --> 00:05:48,666
I choose both

97
00:05:48,666 --> 00:05:52,666
Kode is considering the center of the
store with mature clothes

98
00:05:52,666 --> 00:05:54,666
This is it

99
00:05:54,666 --> 00:05:58,666
This is it

100
00:05:58,666 --> 00:06:00,666
I don't like this

101
00:06:00,666 --> 00:06:04,666
I don't think it's better to check this

102
00:06:04,666 --> 00:06:17,690
I don't think I'm the one who chose it

103
00:06:17,690 --> 00:06:19,690
I'm like a grandpa.

104
00:06:19,690 --> 00:06:21,690
I'm white.

105
00:06:21,690 --> 00:06:25,690
The more she gets impatient, the more
she gets shy.

106
00:06:25,690 --> 00:06:27,690
Kobayashi's choice of clothes.

107
00:06:27,690 --> 00:06:29,690
A girl's hand?

108
00:06:31,690 --> 00:06:33,690
5500 yen.

109
00:06:33,690 --> 00:06:36,690
Hey, this is 5500 yen. What should I do?

110
00:06:36,690 --> 00:06:38,690
Let's keep it for now.

111
00:06:38,690 --> 00:06:40,690
Let's keep it for now.

112
00:06:41,690 --> 00:06:43,690
What will happen?

113
00:06:43,690 --> 00:06:47,690
The first team that finished shopping at
that time.

114
00:06:47,690 --> 00:06:50,690
It's time to eat at the cafe.

115
00:06:50,690 --> 00:06:52,690
What will happen to the shopping?

116
00:06:52,690 --> 00:06:55,690
But the balloons are over there.

117
00:06:55,690 --> 00:06:56,690
That's right.

118
00:06:56,690 --> 00:06:58,690
The balloons are solidified.

119
00:06:58,690 --> 00:06:59,690
What should I say?

120
00:06:59,690 --> 00:07:02,690
I think Kaho will make balloons
seriously.

121
00:07:02,690 --> 00:07:04,690
Ayaka will put in the story.

122
00:07:04,690 --> 00:07:06,690
I feel sorry for her.

123
00:07:06,690 --> 00:07:09,690
Yasumoto predicts that something will
come up.

124
00:07:09,690 --> 00:07:11,690
It's like Halloween.

125
00:07:11,690 --> 00:07:14,690
At that time, Yasumoto.

126
00:07:16,690 --> 00:07:18,690
It's very cute.

127
00:07:18,690 --> 00:07:20,690
This is a mask.

128
00:07:20,690 --> 00:07:21,690
Hinata.

129
00:07:21,690 --> 00:07:24,690
Which do you like, salmon roe or shrimp?

130
00:07:24,690 --> 00:07:25,690
Salmon roe or shrimp?

131
00:07:25,690 --> 00:07:26,690
Shrimp.

132
00:07:26,690 --> 00:07:27,690
I like shrimp.

133
00:07:27,690 --> 00:07:28,690
Then I'll choose shrimp.

134
00:07:28,690 --> 00:07:29,690
What?

135
00:07:29,690 --> 00:07:30,690
This is very cute.

136
00:07:30,690 --> 00:07:34,690
Even though it's a story, Yasumoto has
put in sushi.

137
00:07:34,690 --> 00:07:37,690
What kind of finish will it be?

138
00:07:37,690 --> 00:07:39,690
Hinata, there is an egg.

139
00:07:39,690 --> 00:07:40,690
What should I do?

140
00:07:40,690 --> 00:07:41,690
I'll choose shrimp.

141
00:07:41,690 --> 00:07:42,690
I'll choose shrimp.

142
00:07:43,690 --> 00:07:47,690
At that time, the city team is a new
store.

143
00:07:51,690 --> 00:07:53,690
I can read it.

144
00:07:53,690 --> 00:07:58,690
This is small.

145
00:08:00,690 --> 00:08:02,690
This is definitely a waterfall.

146
00:08:02,690 --> 00:08:05,690
Kobayashi, who continues to meditate, is
in the corner.

147
00:08:05,690 --> 00:08:07,690
There is no waterfall.

148
00:08:07,690 --> 00:08:13,690
Kobayashi is thinking of an adult act.

149
00:08:22,690 --> 00:08:24,690
I've never been here.

150
00:08:24,690 --> 00:08:29,018
I've never been here.

151
00:08:29,018 --> 00:08:33,018
It's about time to go shopping

152
00:08:33,018 --> 00:08:35,018
I wonder if this is good

153
00:08:40,018 --> 00:08:42,018
Is it like a balloon?

154
00:08:43,018 --> 00:08:45,018
What should I do?

155
00:08:45,018 --> 00:08:47,018
Balloon

156
00:08:47,018 --> 00:08:51,018
I'm really scared of balloons

157
00:08:51,018 --> 00:08:52,018
Ayaka

158
00:08:52,018 --> 00:08:55,018
I want it to be blue

159
00:08:55,018 --> 00:08:56,018
Let's do this

160
00:08:56,018 --> 00:08:59,018
It's pretty bright, isn't it?

161
00:08:59,018 --> 00:09:03,018
The cashier is finally getting ready

162
00:09:03,018 --> 00:09:05,018
But

163
00:09:05,018 --> 00:09:09,018
I've got everything, so I'll give you
15,000 yen

164
00:09:09,018 --> 00:09:10,018
Me?

165
00:09:10,018 --> 00:09:12,018
I've already got a little over the price

166
00:09:12,018 --> 00:09:13,018
Seriously?

167
00:09:13,018 --> 00:09:14,018
What should I do?

168
00:09:14,018 --> 00:09:16,018
1900 yen and 1900 yen

169
00:09:16,018 --> 00:09:19,018
It's about 2500 yen

170
00:09:19,018 --> 00:09:23,018
But Ayaka's hat is a little...

171
00:09:23,018 --> 00:09:29,018
So, the shopping is over

172
00:09:29,018 --> 00:09:31,018
I'll come back to buy it later

173
00:09:31,018 --> 00:09:35,018
And the C team

174
00:09:35,018 --> 00:09:38,018
They were still shopping

175
00:09:38,018 --> 00:09:40,018
I'm tired

176
00:09:40,018 --> 00:09:42,018
My glasses

177
00:09:44,018 --> 00:09:47,018
Yasumoto was also checking her round
glasses

178
00:09:47,018 --> 00:09:49,018
It's like a balloon

179
00:09:49,018 --> 00:09:53,018
What should I do?

180
00:09:53,018 --> 00:09:56,018
What should I do?

181
00:09:56,018 --> 00:09:59,018
Do you know what black is?

182
00:09:59,018 --> 00:10:02,018
Can I borrow a hanger here?

183
00:10:02,018 --> 00:10:03,018
Hanger?

184
00:10:03,018 --> 00:10:04,018
Yes

185
00:10:04,018 --> 00:10:06,018
How many minutes is it now?

186
00:10:06,018 --> 00:10:07,018
I think it's been 5 minutes

187
00:10:07,018 --> 00:10:09,018
No way

188
00:10:09,018 --> 00:10:14,018
Matsuno is still determined to buy it

189
00:10:14,018 --> 00:10:18,018
I'm going to match it with black

190
00:10:18,018 --> 00:10:19,018
I'll go with this

191
00:10:19,018 --> 00:10:20,018

192
00:10:20,018 --> 00:10:21,018
I'm glad

193
00:10:21,018 --> 00:10:27,018
They went around the shops and finally
finished

194
00:10:27,018 --> 00:10:30,018
Now both teams are finished

195
00:10:30,018 --> 00:10:35,018
But the unexpected development is...

196
00:10:35,018 --> 00:10:36,018
Here they are

197
00:10:36,018 --> 00:10:38,018

201
00:10:42,018 --> 00:10:43,018
Why?

202
00:10:43,018 --> 00:10:45,018
Why is Matsuno waiting?

203
00:10:45,018 --> 00:10:46,018
What?

204
00:10:46,018 --> 00:10:48,018
I was scared

205
00:10:48,018 --> 00:10:50,018
What happened?

The price went over 30,000 yen

207
00:10:53,018 --> 00:10:55,018
I had to pay

208
00:10:55,018 --> 00:10:58,018
I discussed with the staff

209
00:10:58,018 --> 00:11:03,718
Thank you for watching

210
00:11:03,718 --> 00:11:33,058
How much do you get after a gi Gone

211
00:11:33,058 --> 00:11:35,058

374
00:19:57,402 --> 00:19:59,402
She has a bottle of empty bottles.

375
00:19:59,930 --> 00:20:01,930
It's not good to get in the way

376
00:20:01,930 --> 00:20:03,930
And the hat

377
00:20:03,930 --> 00:20:05,930
The hat is cute

378
00:20:05,930 --> 00:20:07,930
It's cute to leave a balloon

379
00:20:09,930 --> 00:20:11,930
That's all for the coordination

380
00:20:11,930 --> 00:20:15,930
Here are the points that the members are
particular about

381
00:20:17,930 --> 00:20:19,930
How is everyone?

382
00:20:19,930 --> 00:20:21,930
Look at these two

383
00:20:21,930 --> 00:20:23,930
It's cute

384
00:20:23,930 --> 00:20:25,930
It's like Hirota

385
00:20:25,930 --> 00:20:27,930
It's like a fluffy thing

386
00:20:27,930 --> 00:20:29,930
This is

387
00:20:29,930 --> 00:20:31,930
First, it's fluffy

388
00:20:31,930 --> 00:20:33,930
It's like walking

389
00:20:33,930 --> 00:20:35,930
Like this

390
00:20:35,930 --> 00:20:37,930
You hide it

391
00:20:37,930 --> 00:20:39,930
This is also very adult-like

392
00:20:39,930 --> 00:20:41,930
I've never seen Hirota like this

393
00:20:41,930 --> 00:20:43,930
It's different from the other ones

394
00:20:43,930 --> 00:20:45,930
I made it cute with this check

395
00:20:45,930 --> 00:20:47,930
I was confused with black

396
00:20:47,930 --> 00:20:49,930
But it's cute for adults

397
00:20:49,930 --> 00:20:51,930
So I made it like this

398
00:20:51,930 --> 00:20:53,930
How is everyone?

399
00:20:53,930 --> 00:20:55,930
It's cute

400
00:20:55,930 --> 00:20:57,930
I said it's fluffy

401
00:20:57,930 --> 00:21:01,930
I was going to make it like this

402
00:21:01,930 --> 00:21:03,930
You decided from this

403
00:21:03,930 --> 00:21:05,930
And

404
00:21:05,930 --> 00:21:07,930
I made it like this

405
00:21:07,930 --> 00:21:09,930
So that you can see it

406
00:21:09,930 --> 00:21:11,930
It's advanced

407
00:21:11,930 --> 00:21:13,930
Next, Nagayama

408
00:21:13,930 --> 00:21:15,930
It's a shuttle neck

409
00:21:15,930 --> 00:21:17,930
It's shiny

410
00:21:17,930 --> 00:21:21,930
I didn't put the necklace in the hat to
make it look good

411
00:21:21,930 --> 00:21:23,930
I see

412
00:21:23,930 --> 00:21:25,930
I took it off

413
00:21:25,930 --> 00:21:27,930
You didn't ask the staff anything?

414
00:21:27,930 --> 00:21:29,930
I didn't ask anything

415
00:21:29,930 --> 00:21:31,930
I believe you

416
00:21:31,930 --> 00:21:33,930
I think these two are very different

417
00:21:33,930 --> 00:21:35,930
But

418
00:21:35,930 --> 00:21:37,930
Rina-san made it

419
00:21:37,930 --> 00:21:39,930
And

420
00:21:39,930 --> 00:21:43,930
Rina-san said it's cute if you wear it
like that

421
00:21:43,930 --> 00:21:45,930
It's a suggestion from Matsuno

422
00:21:45,930 --> 00:21:47,930
I don't know

423
00:21:47,930 --> 00:21:50,426
I don't know if it's different

424
00:21:50,426 --> 00:21:52,426
Which one is better?

425
00:21:52,426 --> 00:21:54,426
The one with the band.

426
00:21:54,426 --> 00:21:57,426
The director is very good at this.

427
00:21:57,426 --> 00:21:59,426
Next, Kato-san. What's the point?

428
00:21:59,426 --> 00:22:03,426
I think it's better to wear it with the
riders.

429
00:22:03,426 --> 00:22:07,426
Riders can buy it for less than 30,000
yen.

430
00:22:07,426 --> 00:22:09,426
This is the best.

431
00:22:09,426 --> 00:22:11,426
This is the best.

432
00:22:11,426 --> 00:22:14,426
It's amazing that it's going to be like
this from here.

433
00:22:14,426 --> 00:22:18,426
It's like this person's child.

434
00:22:18,426 --> 00:22:20,426
Let's go around.

435
00:22:20,426 --> 00:22:22,426
I'm hungry.

436
00:22:22,426 --> 00:22:26,426
There are blue, blue, red, black and
black.

437
00:22:26,426 --> 00:22:28,426
There are about three colors.

438
00:22:28,426 --> 00:22:30,426
I see. Blue, red, and black.

439
00:22:30,426 --> 00:22:33,426
Your hands are like snakes.

440
00:22:33,426 --> 00:22:35,426
It's cute.

441
00:22:35,426 --> 00:22:38,426
I can't help but be interested in your
hands.

442
00:22:38,426 --> 00:22:40,426
This is the last one.

443
00:22:40,426 --> 00:22:43,426
This is the back theme.

444
00:22:43,426 --> 00:22:49,426
It's warm and kind to hold this glove
and bottle.

445
00:22:49,426 --> 00:22:51,426
Isn't it a budget?

446
00:22:51,426 --> 00:22:53,426
It's a budget.

447
00:22:53,426 --> 00:22:57,426
I chose a men's knitwear.

448
00:22:57,426 --> 00:22:59,426
Is this men's?

449
00:22:59,426 --> 00:23:00,026
It's a men's.

450
00:23:00,026 --> 00:23:07,026
These glasses and hats are for the
balloon teacher's school uniform.

451
00:23:07,026 --> 00:23:08,026
I see.

452
00:23:08,026 --> 00:23:10,026
The school uniform for the teacher.

453
00:23:10,026 --> 00:23:15,026
Based on these points, they will be
reviewing the other students'
coordination.

454
00:23:16,026 --> 00:23:20,026
The pair that gets the most points will
be the winner.

455
00:23:20,026 --> 00:23:22,026
Will they be...

456
00:23:22,026 --> 00:23:32,026
The first place?

457
00:23:32,666 --> 00:23:34,666
The first place is...

458
00:23:39,666 --> 00:23:42,666
Day Team Yasumoto-Kashiwaki pair!

459
00:23:42,666 --> 00:23:44,666
57 points!

460
00:23:44,666 --> 00:23:48,666
Congratulations!

461
00:23:48,666 --> 00:23:51,666
Congratulations!

462
00:23:51,666 --> 00:23:54,666
What do you think the prize is?

463
00:23:54,666 --> 00:23:56,666
What is it?

464
00:23:56,666 --> 00:23:59,666
You don't know the prize?

465
00:23:59,666 --> 00:24:04,666
Lastly, we would like to announce the
prize.

466
00:24:04,666 --> 00:24:06,666
The prize is...

467
00:24:06,666 --> 00:24:12,666
The prize is announced by the special
judge, Kaiki Ogata.

468
00:24:12,666 --> 00:24:17,666
This is AiAi who coordinated with
Hoshina-san.

469
00:24:17,666 --> 00:24:19,666
Congratulations!

470
00:24:19,666 --> 00:24:24,666
Please take this prize.

471
00:24:24,666 --> 00:24:26,666
It's a prize.

472
00:24:26,666 --> 00:24:28,538
That's Ogata.

473
00:24:28,538 --> 00:24:30,538
I'm not in love with you.

474
00:24:30,538 --> 00:24:31,538
I see.

475
00:24:31,538 --> 00:24:33,538
You're a scary shrimp-chewed Tastass.

476
00:24:35,538 --> 00:24:38,538
The coordinate battle won by the winner
of the battle is...

477
00:24:38,538 --> 00:24:41,538
Yasumoto and Kashiwagi.

478
00:24:41,538 --> 00:24:43,538
Balloon Kode may be popular.

479
00:24:44,538 --> 00:24:46,538
Next episode of shrimp-chewed Tastass
is...

480
00:24:46,538 --> 00:24:48,538
Shrimp-chewed Tastass News.

481
00:24:48,538 --> 00:24:51,538
Pick up the incident that happened in
Tastass.

482
00:24:51,538 --> 00:24:53,538
That strange temptation is also a
source.

483
00:24:53,538 --> 00:24:59,538
The winner of the Tastass is...

484
00:24:59,538 --> 00:25:04,346
Thank you for watching.

485
00:25:04,346 --> 00:25:08,346
And to those who missed the shrimp-
chewed tastas.

486
00:25:08,346 --> 00:25:11,346
On the Star Dust channel, a video
distribution site,

487
00:25:11,346 --> 00:25:14,346
shrimp-chewed tastas are being widely
distributed.

488
00:25:14,346 --> 00:25:20,858
Thank you for watching.

489
00:25:20,858 --> 00:25:24,858
If you want to enjoy the game, you can
get a free shrimp-shaped tastasus for
400 yen a month.

490
00:25:25,858 --> 00:25:29,858
In addition, there are a lot of
unreleased video clips.

491
00:25:30,858 --> 00:25:33,858
For more information, please search for
the Stardust channel.

492
00:25:35,858 --> 00:25:40,858
This program was provided by the sponsor
you are watching.

493
00:25:40,858 --> 00:25:42,858
My guitar is going to sound like this
today.

494
00:25:44,858 --> 00:25:45,858
It was delicious.

495
00:25:45,858 --> 00:25:46,858
Wait a minute.

496
00:25:46,858 --> 00:25:49,858
I'm scared.

497
00:25:50,858 --> 00:25:51,858
Good.

498
00:25:51,858 --> 00:25:54,441
Thank you.
