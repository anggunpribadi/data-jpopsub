00:00.000 --> 00:05.760
 Now, let's start HIKIME是 ○メンタージョスTV~~~

00:10.736 --> 00:15.736
 We've been talking about the last show.

00:15.736 --> 00:17.736
 How was it?

00:17.736 --> 00:19.736
 How was it?

00:19.736 --> 00:21.736
 How was it, Juri?

00:21.736 --> 00:23.736
 How was it?

00:23.736 --> 00:28.736
 We've been thinking about the members.

00:28.736 --> 00:31.736
 We want to be the king of all.

00:31.736 --> 00:32.736
 All of us?

00:32.736 --> 00:33.736
 That's it.

00:33.736 --> 00:35.736
 Three of us are done.

00:35.736 --> 00:37.736
 Who's the king of all?

00:37.736 --> 00:40.736
 Four of us?

00:40.736 --> 00:42.736
 Three of us.

00:42.736 --> 00:44.736
 Today is the fourth.

00:44.736 --> 00:47.736
 Who was the king of all?

00:47.736 --> 00:49.736
 The last time was the punishment game.

00:49.736 --> 00:51.736
 These two.

00:51.736 --> 00:54.736
 We'll reflect on it.

00:54.736 --> 00:56.736
 That's right.

00:56.736 --> 00:59.736
 If you think about it,

00:59.736 --> 01:02.736
 I think it's someone's king.

01:02.736 --> 01:04.736
 Someone's king.

01:04.736 --> 01:09.736
 We've been thinking about the king of
all.

01:09.736 --> 01:11.736
 We've been making it.

01:11.736 --> 01:14.736
 We've been making it.

01:14.736 --> 01:18.736
 I think it's good to have everyone.

01:18.736 --> 01:22.736
 If everyone is gone, it's like a fool.

01:22.736 --> 01:24.736
 But it was really good.

01:24.736 --> 01:27.736
 I thought of a really good idea.

01:27.736 --> 01:29.736
 I don't know.

01:29.736 --> 01:30.736
 What is it?

01:30.736 --> 01:34.736
 It's like a charity.

01:34.736 --> 01:37.736
 Anyone can buy it.

01:37.736 --> 01:39.736
 I thought of that.

01:39.736 --> 01:42.736
 That's good.

01:42.736 --> 01:45.736
 It's a good idea.

01:45.736 --> 01:47.736
 I'll make a good suggestion.

01:47.736 --> 01:51.736
 It's like a good suggestion meeting.

01:51.736 --> 01:54.736
 It's like a charity.

01:54.736 --> 01:55.736
 I'll make it.

01:55.736 --> 01:58.736
 We'll have a good suggestion meeting.

01:58.736 --> 02:01.736
 What are we doing this week?

02:01.736 --> 02:03.736
 As you know,

02:03.736 --> 02:07.736
 I'd like to decide on KITTY.

02:07.736 --> 02:09.736
 I've been waiting for this.

02:09.736 --> 02:11.736
 I'm confident.

02:11.736 --> 02:14.736
 Are you confident?

02:14.736 --> 02:16.736
 Yes.

02:16.736 --> 02:17.736
 Then,

02:17.736 --> 02:20.736
 I have no reason.

02:20.736 --> 02:22.736
 Who else is confident?

02:22.736 --> 02:23.736
 Yes.

02:23.736 --> 02:26.736
 Why are you two so excited?

02:26.736 --> 02:27.736
 Isn't it strange?

02:27.736 --> 02:29.736
 Because we're next to each other.

02:29.736 --> 02:30.736
 That's right.

02:30.736 --> 02:34.736
 Haru and Julia are always next to me.

02:34.736 --> 02:36.736
 But this time,

02:36.736 --> 02:39.736
 everyone is equal.

02:39.736 --> 02:43.736
 It's not about the past.

02:43.736 --> 02:45.736
 Everyone is equal.

02:45.736 --> 02:47.736
 So, Aki and Julia...

02:47.736 --> 02:48.736
 Julia?

02:48.736 --> 02:50.736
 Julia is also...

02:50.736 --> 02:52.736
 It's fun.

02:52.736 --> 02:55.736
 It's a round table.

02:55.736 --> 02:57.736
 It's far.

02:57.736 --> 02:59.736
 It's okay.

02:59.736 --> 03:01.736
 We're the same age.

03:01.736 --> 03:03.736
 That's right.

03:03.736 --> 03:06.736
 We're not the same age.

03:06.736 --> 03:08.736
 We're not.

03:08.736 --> 03:11.736
 We're not close.

03:11.736 --> 03:14.736
 It's so far, but I'm always next to
you.

03:14.736 --> 03:16.736
 It's amazing.

03:16.736 --> 03:17.736
 I'm sorry.

03:17.736 --> 03:18.736
 It's a round table.

03:18.736 --> 03:20.736
 It's a round table.

03:20.736 --> 03:23.736
 Aki, please read the usual question.

03:23.736 --> 03:27.736
 We're going to give you a quiz about
Hitochan.

03:27.736 --> 03:31.736
 Hitochan answers the questions by
writing a line.

03:31.736 --> 03:36.736
 You have to guess what she wrote.

03:36.736 --> 03:39.736
 It's easy if you know about Hitochan.

03:39.736 --> 03:40.736
 Let's do our best.

03:40.736 --> 03:43.200
 Please watch the next video and follow
us on Twitter.

03:44.200 --> 03:46.200
 Let's get started.

03:48.200 --> 03:50.200
 There is a game.

03:50.200 --> 03:56.200
 If you get one question right, you can
get 1 REO-kun point.

04:00.200 --> 04:04.200
 If you can't get the most, you can get
a penalty.

04:06.200 --> 04:07.200
 I'm scared.

04:07.200 --> 04:13.200
 Last time, we played a game called
Namakemono.

04:13.200 --> 04:16.200
 The last time was Kumano.

04:17.200 --> 04:19.200
 Are you ready?

04:20.200 --> 04:22.200
 Let's get started.

04:22.200 --> 04:34.200
 This program is brought to you by the
six members who work hard to promote
something exciting.

04:52.200 --> 05:00.096
 Subscribe to our channel here!

05:00.096 --> 05:04.856
 Be honest & tell me your stories

05:05.976 --> 05:09.156
 The first!

05:09.156 --> 05:11.156
 I think you know what this is.

05:11.156 --> 05:12.880
 Bye bye!

05:12.880 --> 05:17.880
 What is the color of the toothbrush
that Chito-chan and Chitose-chan use?

05:17.880 --> 05:18.880
 I used it!

05:18.880 --> 05:19.880
 That's it!

05:19.880 --> 05:22.880
 This is the easiest one.

05:22.880 --> 05:24.880
 I forgot to say it, but the time limit
is 1 minute.

05:24.880 --> 05:26.880
 40 seconds left.

05:26.880 --> 05:28.880
 I didn't even choose 1 minute.

05:28.880 --> 05:30.880
 You didn't choose it.

05:30.880 --> 05:31.880
 I didn't choose it.

05:31.880 --> 05:32.880
 Oh, you didn't choose it.

05:32.880 --> 05:33.880
 I didn't choose it.

05:33.880 --> 05:34.880
 Then, it's okay.

05:34.880 --> 05:35.880
 It's okay.

05:35.880 --> 05:36.880
 I think it's right.

05:36.880 --> 05:37.880
 Is Hiyorin okay?

05:37.880 --> 05:38.880
 I don't know.

05:38.880 --> 05:39.880
 Kaito.

05:39.880 --> 05:43.880
 I'm sure your answers are the same.

05:43.880 --> 05:45.880
 Do you agree, Mahiru?

05:45.880 --> 05:46.880
 Yes.

05:46.880 --> 05:47.880
 What is your favorite color?

05:47.880 --> 05:49.880
 Let's see.

05:49.880 --> 05:50.880
 One, two, three.

05:50.880 --> 05:51.880
 Ta-da!

05:51.880 --> 05:52.880
 Pink!

05:52.880 --> 05:53.880
 Pink!

05:53.880 --> 05:54.880
 Pink!

05:54.880 --> 05:55.880
 Red!

05:55.880 --> 05:56.880
 Pink!

05:56.880 --> 05:57.880
 Red!

05:57.880 --> 05:59.880
 I love it!

05:59.880 --> 06:00.880
 I love it.

06:00.880 --> 06:01.880
 I love it.

06:01.880 --> 06:02.880
 I love it.

06:02.880 --> 06:06.880
 I don't have to ask you why.

06:06.880 --> 06:08.880
 I wrote it down again.

06:08.880 --> 06:09.880
 Red.

06:09.880 --> 06:11.880
 Do you want to go to the moon?

06:11.880 --> 06:13.880
 1st or 2nd floor.

06:13.880 --> 06:15.880
 We can go to the moon.

06:15.880 --> 06:19.880
 Let's watch our world tour!

06:19.880 --> 06:21.280
 And Pudding.

06:23.832 --> 06:25.832
 What's the color of your toothbrush
that you've been using?

06:26.832 --> 06:31.832
 The color of my toothbrush that I've
been using since I was in elementary
school is...

06:32.832 --> 06:33.832
 Pink!

06:36.832 --> 06:41.832
 So, the answer is Kanamin, Junia and
Aki-chan!

06:46.832 --> 06:47.832
 It's like Leo-kun!

06:47.832 --> 06:48.832
 Leo-kun points!

06:50.832 --> 06:52.832
 What's the color of your toothbrush
that you've been using since you were in
elementary school?

06:55.832 --> 06:56.832
 It's long!

06:57.832 --> 07:04.832
 So, Aki-chan, Kanamin and Junia got one
point each!

07:06.832 --> 07:08.832
 Let's move on to the next question!

07:08.832 --> 07:11.832
 The next question is...

07:14.832 --> 07:15.832
 The next question is...

07:16.832 --> 07:18.832
 This one is easy too!

07:20.832 --> 07:22.832
 What's the color of your toothbrush
that you've been using since you were in
elementary school?

07:23.832 --> 07:25.832
 The color of your toothbrush is
perfect!

07:26.832 --> 07:27.832
 But this is...

07:28.832 --> 07:29.832
 Wait, this is...

07:30.832 --> 07:31.832
 Everything is perfect!

07:32.832 --> 07:33.832
 Everything is perfect!

07:33.832 --> 07:36.832
 This is also a perfect spelling.

07:37.832 --> 07:41.832
 You can tell that it's perfect even if
you see it in the answer sheet.

07:43.832 --> 07:45.832
 But it's okay if you see it in the
answer sheet.

07:46.832 --> 07:47.832
 That's true.

07:48.832 --> 07:49.832
 But you can't see it in the answer
sheet.

07:51.832 --> 07:52.832
 I think it's okay.

07:53.832 --> 07:55.832
 Wait, I'm so confused.

07:56.832 --> 07:58.832
 I think I've said it before.

07:59.832 --> 08:00.832
 I think so too.

08:00.832 --> 08:02.832
 I think it's a mistake.

08:03.832 --> 08:07.832
 I think I've said it a few times.

08:08.832 --> 08:09.832
 I think it's a mistake.

08:11.832 --> 08:13.832
 What's the name of the book you read
yesterday?

08:14.832 --> 08:15.832
 Hitokan Shishinjyuu.

08:16.832 --> 08:17.832
 I think I've read it before.

08:19.832 --> 08:20.832
 What's the time?

08:21.832 --> 08:22.832
 20 seconds left.

08:23.832 --> 08:24.832
 It was too long!

08:27.832 --> 08:28.832
 It's either one of them.

08:28.832 --> 08:29.832
 It's either one of them.

08:30.832 --> 08:31.832
 10 seconds left.

08:32.832 --> 08:33.832
 Which one?

08:34.832 --> 08:35.832
 I can't help it.

08:36.832 --> 08:37.832
 I can't help it.

08:38.832 --> 08:39.832
 I can't tell which one is the name.

08:40.832 --> 08:42.832
 Please think about it with me.

08:43.832 --> 08:44.832
 I'm done.

08:45.832 --> 08:48.832
 Please write your answer together.

08:49.832 --> 08:50.832
 Ready, go!

08:51.832 --> 08:52.832
 First love.

08:53.832 --> 08:54.832
 First love.

08:55.832 --> 08:56.832
 First love.

08:56.832 --> 08:57.832
 Wait, let me see.

08:59.832 --> 09:00.832
 It's the same word at the beginning.

09:01.832 --> 09:02.832
 Yes, I think so too.

09:03.832 --> 09:04.832
 Only F and L are the same.

09:05.832 --> 09:07.832
 Everyone, please show us the same word.

09:09.832 --> 09:12.832
 I think F and L are the same.

09:15.832 --> 09:16.832
 F and...

09:20.832 --> 09:21.832
 Isn't it first?

09:22.832 --> 09:23.832
 First.

09:23.832 --> 09:24.832
 First.

09:24.832 --> 09:32.544
 Please check the next video!

09:33.544 --> 09:34.544
 What?

09:35.544 --> 09:37.544
 What is the title of your photo book?

09:37.544 --> 09:41.824
 My title is...

09:41.824 --> 09:43.824
 Konnomiya!

09:43.824 --> 09:48.824
 I think you know the title of the first
song.

09:48.824 --> 09:53.824
 But I'm not sure if you can spell it.
Especially Piyo-chan.

09:53.824 --> 09:55.824
 You're making it shorter.

09:55.824 --> 09:57.824
 I think you're writing it wrong.

09:57.824 --> 10:00.824
 The answer is...

10:00.824 --> 10:01.824
 FI...

10:01.824 --> 10:02.824
 FILS?

10:02.824 --> 10:04.824
 FILS?

10:08.442 --> 10:10.442
 You saw it yesterday, right?

10:10.442 --> 10:11.442
 Yes, I did.

10:11.442 --> 10:13.442
 So,

10:13.442 --> 10:17.442
 Kanamin, Julia and Oharu

10:17.442 --> 10:19.442
 got it right!

10:19.442 --> 10:21.442
 We got it right!

10:21.442 --> 10:25.442
 Aki-chan's was all in 5 letters.

10:25.442 --> 10:26.442
 I got it right.

10:26.442 --> 10:27.442
 But,

10:27.442 --> 10:28.442
 it's okay.

10:28.442 --> 10:32.442
 It was close.

10:32.442 --> 10:34.442
 But, I got it right.

10:34.442 --> 10:36.442
 Thank you.

10:36.442 --> 10:37.442
 Thank you.

10:37.442 --> 10:39.442
 Unfortunately,

10:39.442 --> 10:42.442
 we can't give you points.

10:42.442 --> 10:44.442
 Kiyochan, you got it right.

10:44.442 --> 10:45.442
 I did.

10:45.442 --> 10:46.442
 I got it right.

10:46.442 --> 10:49.442
 I was so confident.

10:49.442 --> 10:51.442
 I got 0 points for one person.

10:51.442 --> 10:52.442
 Really?

10:52.442 --> 10:55.442
 Is it the same as the first letter of
Breakfast?

10:55.442 --> 10:57.442
 No.

10:57.442 --> 10:58.442
 It's not.

10:58.442 --> 10:59.442
 It's not.

10:59.442 --> 11:02.442
 Breakfast is F, A.

11:02.442 --> 11:04.442
 It's different from that.

11:04.442 --> 11:05.442
 It's different from that.

11:05.442 --> 11:08.442
 Breakfast is F, A.

11:08.442 --> 11:10.442
 Let's get back to it.

11:10.442 --> 11:12.442
 We still have some questions.

11:12.442 --> 11:14.442
 Let's move on to the next question.

11:14.442 --> 11:19.442
 The next question is...

11:19.442 --> 11:22.442
 The next question is...

11:22.442 --> 11:25.442
 I can tell if I look at it.

11:25.442 --> 11:26.442
 Let's go.

11:26.442 --> 11:27.442
 Ta-da.

11:27.442 --> 11:29.442
 What is Hitochan's present?

11:29.442 --> 11:30.442
 I don't know.

11:30.442 --> 11:33.442
 Who is the most popular character in
the current era?

11:33.442 --> 11:37.442
 Inumaki, Kaneki, and who is the other
one?

11:37.442 --> 11:39.442
 Seriously?

11:39.442 --> 11:46.442
 I think it's going to change soon.

11:46.442 --> 11:49.442
 These two are popular.

11:49.442 --> 11:51.442
 I don't know.

11:51.442 --> 11:53.442
 I don't know.

11:53.442 --> 11:55.442
 I'll give you a hint.

11:55.442 --> 11:58.442
 Some people don't know anime.

11:58.442 --> 12:00.442
 Some people don't like anime.

12:00.442 --> 12:01.442
 But, they watch anime.

12:01.442 --> 12:02.442
 Wait.

12:05.442 --> 12:06.442
 I don't know.

12:06.442 --> 12:08.442
 Some people don't like otaku.

12:08.442 --> 12:11.442
 Some people don't like anime.

12:11.442 --> 12:12.442
 Wait.

12:12.442 --> 12:14.442
 Can I say the general answer?

12:14.442 --> 12:18.442
 The general answer is correct.

12:18.442 --> 12:19.442
 What is it?

12:19.442 --> 12:21.442
 I don't know.

12:21.442 --> 12:23.442
 You know the character, don't you?

12:23.442 --> 12:24.442
 I know.

12:24.442 --> 12:25.442
 What?

12:25.442 --> 12:27.442
 I know the character.

12:27.442 --> 12:29.442
 You know the character?

12:29.442 --> 12:30.442
 What?

12:31.442 --> 12:33.442
 I'm sure it's correct.

12:33.442 --> 12:36.442
 I know it since I was a child.

12:36.442 --> 12:37.442
 Right?

12:37.442 --> 12:39.442
 I'm sure you know it.

12:39.442 --> 12:52.442
 10, 9, 8, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1.

12:52.442 --> 12:54.442
 Did you all get it?

12:54.442 --> 12:57.442
 Please answer it together.

12:57.442 --> 12:58.442
 Ready, go.

12:59.442 --> 13:00.442
 Shin-chan.

13:00.442 --> 13:02.442
 Conan-kun.

13:02.442 --> 13:03.442
 Conan-kun.

13:03.442 --> 13:05.442
 The person who was in Ghibli.

13:07.442 --> 13:08.442
 That's right.

13:08.442 --> 13:10.442
 Then, who is it?

13:10.442 --> 13:12.442
 It's close.

13:12.442 --> 13:13.442
 VTR.

13:13.442 --> 13:14.442
 What?

13:14.442 --> 13:16.442
 The person who was in Ghibli.

13:17.442 --> 13:23.442
 Who is the person who is in the
picture?

13:23.442 --> 13:31.442
 The person who I like the most is Haul.

13:33.442 --> 13:36.442
 I like Haul the most.

13:36.442 --> 13:40.442
 I saw it on TV.

13:40.442 --> 13:45.442
 I thought Haul is cool and I like him.

13:45.442 --> 13:50.442
 I like these three people including
Haul.

13:50.442 --> 13:53.442
 It's too funny.

13:53.442 --> 13:59.442
 I like all of them.

13:59.442 --> 14:01.442
 I like Shin-chan.

14:01.442 --> 14:03.442
 I like Conan-kun too.

14:03.442 --> 14:07.442
 I'm looking forward to the movie that
will be released on April 16th and 17th.

14:07.442 --> 14:09.442
 I'm late.

14:10.442 --> 14:11.442
 Aki-chan.

14:11.442 --> 14:12.442
 I'm late.

14:12.442 --> 14:13.442
 It's funny.

14:13.442 --> 14:14.442
 I like Aki-chan.

14:14.442 --> 14:15.442
 I watch it every day.

14:15.442 --> 14:16.442
 Every day?

14:16.442 --> 14:19.442
 She's cute.

14:19.442 --> 14:20.442
 She's cute.

14:20.442 --> 14:22.442
 She's like a monkey.

14:27.442 --> 14:29.442
 I got it.

14:30.442 --> 14:32.442
 Shiori-chan is correct.

14:33.442 --> 14:35.442
 I was told that it's an anime.

14:35.442 --> 14:37.442
 I see.

14:37.442 --> 14:39.442
 I was told that it's an anime.

14:39.442 --> 14:44.442
 I was told that it's an anime.

14:44.442 --> 14:46.442
 I was wondering if I could put this in
the anime.

14:46.442 --> 14:49.442
 I thought it's a Jujutsu Kaisen.

14:49.442 --> 14:51.442
 I thought it's a Jujutsu Kaisen.

14:51.442 --> 14:52.442
 I thought it's a Jujutsu Kaisen.

14:52.442 --> 14:53.442
 I thought it's a Jujutsu Kaisen.

14:53.442 --> 14:55.442
 Because she is small.

14:55.442 --> 14:56.442
 She is small.

14:56.442 --> 15:00.442
 It was cool.

15:00.442 --> 15:02.442
 I did Haul.

15:02.442 --> 15:06.442
 I'll give you points for Shiori's
anime.

15:06.442 --> 15:11.442
 I'll give you points for Shiori's
anime.

15:11.442 --> 15:12.480
 Thank you for watching!

15:12.480 --> 15:15.480
 I know this one.

15:15.480 --> 15:16.480
 Ta-da!

15:16.480 --> 15:23.480
 What is Hito-chan's favorite word on
the official website of the Super-
Touhou?

15:23.480 --> 15:25.480
 I know this one.

15:25.480 --> 15:28.480
 I often say this.

15:28.480 --> 15:35.480
 When I'm asked if there is a word I
like, I always answer.

15:35.480 --> 15:37.480
 But it's a good word.

15:37.480 --> 15:40.480
 If you don't know, you can write a good
word.

15:40.480 --> 15:42.480
 I know this one.

15:44.480 --> 15:46.480
 You haven't changed.

15:46.480 --> 15:48.480
 I haven't changed.

15:48.480 --> 15:49.480
 I know this one.

15:49.480 --> 15:52.480
 This is a word I often say.

15:52.480 --> 15:54.480
 I know this one.

15:54.480 --> 15:55.480
 I know this one.

15:55.480 --> 15:57.480
 I know this one.

15:57.480 --> 16:00.480
 Please answer together.

16:00.480 --> 16:01.480
 One, two, three.

16:01.480 --> 16:04.480
 People shine because they have dreams.

16:04.480 --> 16:06.480
 No.

16:06.480 --> 16:07.480
 I know this one.

16:07.480 --> 16:13.480
 People shine because they have dreams.

16:13.480 --> 16:16.480
 They work hard to move forward.

16:16.480 --> 16:18.480
 I know this one.

16:21.480 --> 16:23.480
 I changed it.

16:25.480 --> 16:28.480
 I want to tell you the answer.

16:29.480 --> 16:30.480
 I'll change it.

16:30.480 --> 16:32.480
 I'll change it.

16:32.480 --> 16:34.480
 It's cool.

16:34.480 --> 16:37.480
 What is the answer?

16:37.480 --> 16:38.480
 Please show us the video.

16:38.480 --> 16:44.480
 What is your favorite word on the
official website of Super-Touhou?

16:44.480 --> 16:50.480
 I've talked about this word in various
places.

16:50.480 --> 16:52.480
 The answer is...

16:52.480 --> 16:55.480
 People shine because they have dreams.

16:55.480 --> 16:57.480
 I'll change it.

16:57.480 --> 16:59.480
 I'll change it.

16:59.480 --> 17:01.480
 People shine.

17:01.480 --> 17:04.480
 I thought it was easy.

17:04.480 --> 17:07.480
 Hiyoyon, you're not a good speaker.

17:09.480 --> 17:12.480
 I thought of the word sun.

17:12.480 --> 17:15.480
 But, the sun was in the way.

17:15.480 --> 17:18.480
 I couldn't think of other words.

17:18.480 --> 17:22.480
 But, I understood the word when I saw
the mirror.

17:22.480 --> 17:25.480
 I understood it as a part of my life.

17:25.480 --> 17:27.480
 I'll change it.

17:27.480 --> 17:30.480
 People shine because they have dreams.

17:30.480 --> 17:31.480
 This is a good word.

17:31.480 --> 17:33.480
 It's a perfect word for Aki-chan.

17:33.480 --> 17:35.480
 I like it.

17:35.480 --> 17:38.480
 Maybe, it'll be on the official
website.

17:38.480 --> 17:41.480
 I'll say what I like.

17:41.480 --> 17:43.480
 I think it'll be a lot today.

17:43.480 --> 17:45.480
 I think it's a good word.

17:45.480 --> 17:47.480
 It's written by Kite-chan.

17:47.480 --> 17:51.480
 I think it's a good word.

17:51.480 --> 17:56.480
 I'll keep this word in my heart as I
become an idol.

17:56.480 --> 17:58.480
 But, it's a bit...

17:58.480 --> 18:00.480
 It's a bit short.

18:00.480 --> 18:02.480
 I'm not in a good mood.

18:02.480 --> 18:04.480
 I didn't press it.

18:04.480 --> 18:07.480
 Karami-san, you're a good speaker.

18:07.480 --> 18:09.480
 I'm looking forward to it.

18:09.480 --> 18:11.480
 I can't remember the words.

18:13.480 --> 18:15.480
 It's fun.

18:15.480 --> 18:18.480
 We have half of the time left.

18:18.480 --> 18:24.032
 Please look forward to the next video!

18:25.032 --> 18:27.032
 This is a bit difficult.

18:27.032 --> 18:32.032
 My mom said that I might have written
this on a blog.

18:33.032 --> 18:34.032
 But this is difficult.

18:34.032 --> 18:36.032
 This is the one.

18:36.032 --> 18:37.032
 I'll go.

18:38.032 --> 18:41.032
 I was learning swimming when I was in
elementary school.

18:41.032 --> 18:45.032
 My teacher said that I should quit if I
passed the crawl test.

18:45.032 --> 18:51.032
 My dad said that I did my best until I
got to the crawl test.

18:51.032 --> 18:53.032
 What does that mean?

18:53.032 --> 18:55.032
 I don't know.

18:55.032 --> 18:57.032
 I thought you were a swimmer.

19:01.032 --> 19:03.032
 I did it until I was in the lower grade
of elementary school.

19:06.032 --> 19:09.032
 I did it until I got the crawl test.

19:10.032 --> 19:13.032
 I can't do butterfly, but I didn't like
it.

19:13.032 --> 19:17.032
 I wanted to quit, but I was in the
lower grade of elementary school.

19:17.032 --> 19:20.032
 I was 10 or 19 years old.

19:20.032 --> 19:24.032
 I did my best because of my dad's
words.

19:24.032 --> 19:26.032
 I'm a girl.

19:28.032 --> 19:30.032
 Is your dad impressed?

19:30.032 --> 19:32.032
 My dad didn't say that.

19:32.032 --> 19:34.032
 I didn't?

19:35.032 --> 19:38.032
 But my dad said that I was persuasive.

19:40.032 --> 19:43.032
 Please think about it.

19:43.032 --> 19:46.032
 I think you are a cute girl.

19:46.032 --> 19:48.032
 Did you write down your answer?

19:48.032 --> 19:49.032
 Yes.

19:49.032 --> 19:54.032
 Please write down your answer.

19:56.032 --> 19:58.032
 I'll be popular if I can swim.

20:01.032 --> 20:03.032
 I'll marry a swimmer.

20:07.032 --> 20:08.032
 I can't marry her.

20:08.032 --> 20:10.032
 I wanted to marry my dad.

20:10.032 --> 20:13.032
 Swimmers are cool.

20:18.032 --> 20:20.032
 I can be a princess.

20:22.032 --> 20:24.032
 I can be Ariel.

20:25.032 --> 20:26.032
 I'm the same.

20:26.032 --> 20:28.032
 But my dad is...

20:31.032 --> 20:33.032
 He is persuasive.

20:33.032 --> 20:35.032
 I'm a cool girl.

20:35.032 --> 20:37.032
 I'm a cool girl.

20:38.032 --> 20:39.032
 I don't know.

20:39.032 --> 20:41.032
 My dad is Ariel.

20:43.032 --> 20:45.032
 I'll write down my answer.

20:45.032 --> 20:48.032
 I'm the closest to my dad.

20:48.032 --> 20:50.032
 Please write down your answer.

20:50.032 --> 20:57.032
 Hitochan, who was learning swimming in
elementary school, wanted to quit
swimming.

20:57.032 --> 21:00.032
 But she did her best because of her
dad's words.

21:00.032 --> 21:03.032
 What is that?

21:03.032 --> 21:07.032
 I was learning swimming, but I wasn't
good at it.

21:07.032 --> 21:11.032
 I told my dad that I wanted to quit
swimming.

21:11.032 --> 21:19.032
 But my dad said that I should be a
swimmer when I was an adult.

21:19.032 --> 21:21.032
 Because I was a good swimmer.

21:21.032 --> 21:23.032
 I wanted to be a swimmer.

21:23.032 --> 21:30.032
 I was 10 years old when I was told
that.

21:30.032 --> 21:36.032
 I wanted to date, so I learned
swimming.

21:36.032 --> 21:37.032
 That's cute.

21:39.032 --> 21:43.032
 I told my dad that I should be a
swimmer when I date.

21:45.032 --> 21:49.032
 I told him that there was no one who
swam in the black water.

21:49.032 --> 21:51.032
 I was a swimmer.

21:51.032 --> 21:53.032
 You were a swimmer.

21:58.032 --> 22:02.032
 I told my dad that I couldn't swim
because of my face.

22:02.032 --> 22:07.032
 But he said that there was no one who
swam in the black water.

22:07.032 --> 22:09.032
 So, I swam in the black water.

22:09.032 --> 22:11.032
 That's a dream.

22:13.032 --> 22:17.032
 Maybe my mom saw me when I was dating
with my dad.

22:17.032 --> 22:19.032
 She fell in love with me.

22:21.032 --> 22:23.032
 I didn't expect that.

22:24.032 --> 22:26.032
 I was a swimmer.

22:30.032 --> 22:32.032
 You have a different style.

22:32.032 --> 22:34.032
 I have a different style.

22:34.032 --> 22:35.032
 You were a swimmer.

22:35.032 --> 22:37.032
 Do you swim?

22:39.032 --> 22:41.032
 I'm a dog.

22:41.032 --> 22:43.032
 You are a dog.

22:43.032 --> 22:45.032
 I'm a dog.

22:45.032 --> 22:47.032
 I don't know if there is a dog.

22:47.032 --> 22:49.032
 I'm a swimmer.

22:49.032 --> 22:51.032
 I'm a swimmer.

22:57.032 --> 23:01.032
 Women should practice swimming.

23:01.032 --> 23:03.032
 The correct answer is...

23:03.032 --> 23:05.032
 0.

23:05.032 --> 23:06.032
 It was fun.

23:06.032 --> 23:13.032
 Next, let's move on to the next
question.

23:14.032 --> 23:17.032
 This is easy.

23:17.032 --> 23:19.032
 Kanami might know the answer.

23:19.032 --> 23:21.032
 I don't know.

23:21.032 --> 23:23.032
 I'm sure you all know the answer.

23:24.032 --> 23:29.032
 What is Hito's favorite item?

23:29.032 --> 23:31.032
 There were only two items.

23:32.032 --> 23:34.032
 I think the first one is the best.

23:34.032 --> 23:37.032
 I think I know the answer.

23:37.032 --> 23:39.032
 I have three.

23:39.032 --> 23:42.032
 Please tell me the name of the item.

23:46.032 --> 23:53.032
 Please tell me the name of the item.

23:53.032 --> 24:01.032
 You can know the answer if you watch
the fan club.

24:02.328 --> 24:04.328
 You can know the answer if you watch
the fan club.

24:04.328 --> 24:06.328
 You watch it, right?

24:07.328 --> 24:09.328
 I saw you eating natto.

24:09.328 --> 24:11.328
 I did.

24:11.328 --> 24:13.328
 Then...

24:15.328 --> 24:16.328
 Oh, it's over.

24:16.328 --> 24:17.328
 Did you eat it?

24:17.328 --> 24:18.328
 Yes, I did.

24:18.328 --> 24:22.328
 I smelled it and waited for 30 seconds.

24:22.328 --> 24:24.328
 I've seen you eat it.

24:24.328 --> 24:26.328
 It has nothing to do with natto.

24:26.328 --> 24:27.328
 Can I?

24:27.328 --> 24:28.328
 Yes.

24:28.328 --> 24:29.328
 That's it.

24:31.752 --> 24:35.752
 Well, then, please answer.

24:36.752 --> 24:37.752
 One, two, three.

24:37.752 --> 24:38.752
 Doraemon.

24:38.752 --> 24:39.752
 Dekinmon.

24:39.752 --> 24:40.752
 Tomato.

24:40.752 --> 24:41.752
 Resta Aemon.

24:41.752 --> 24:42.752
 Apple.

24:42.752 --> 24:43.752
 Dekinmon.

24:44.752 --> 24:45.752
 Apple.

24:45.752 --> 24:50.752
 Well, then, please show the correct
answer.

24:52.808 --> 24:55.808
 What is your favorite food?

24:56.808 --> 25:00.808
 My favorite food is sweet potato.

25:02.808 --> 25:09.808
 I think I like sweet potato the most
among all the foods in the world.

25:09.808 --> 25:13.808
 By the way, you can also grill sweet
potatoes.

25:17.792 --> 25:20.792
 So, it's sweet potato.

25:20.792 --> 25:22.792
 First of all,

25:22.792 --> 25:23.792
 Yakiimo.

25:23.792 --> 25:25.792
 Yakiimo is correct.

25:25.792 --> 25:27.792
 Is it steamed sweet potato?

25:27.792 --> 25:31.792
 I like steamed sweet potato.

25:31.792 --> 25:33.792
 I like Oizu.

25:33.792 --> 25:35.792
 Oizu?

25:35.792 --> 25:37.792
 I thought Oizu was a Japanese sweet
potato.

25:37.792 --> 25:39.792
 Oikoshi.

25:41.792 --> 25:43.792
 Steamed sweet potato.

25:43.792 --> 25:48.792
 It's not a potato, but sweet potato.

25:48.792 --> 25:50.792
 It's not a potato.

25:50.792 --> 25:52.792
 It's sweet potato.

25:52.792 --> 25:54.792
 Sweet potato.

25:56.792 --> 25:58.792
 So,

25:58.792 --> 26:03.792
 Aki and Tanami are correct.

26:04.936 --> 26:06.936
 I can't eat potatoes.

26:06.936 --> 26:08.936
 I have an allergic reaction.

26:08.936 --> 26:09.936
 I can't eat it.

26:09.936 --> 26:11.936
 But I love sweet potatoes.

26:11.936 --> 26:17.936
 I talked to Aki about her favorite
food.

26:17.936 --> 26:20.936
 And I asked Tanami to eat it.

26:20.936 --> 26:24.936
 She answered me.

26:25.936 --> 26:26.936
 Tomato is...

26:26.936 --> 26:27.936
 It's bear.

26:27.936 --> 26:28.936
 I like bear.

26:29.936 --> 26:30.936
 It's apple.

26:30.936 --> 26:31.936
 I like apple.

26:32.936 --> 26:34.936
 I know you like many kinds of apple.

26:36.936 --> 26:37.936
 I like apple, too.

26:37.936 --> 26:39.936
 But I like sweet potato the most.

26:42.936 --> 26:43.936
 Kanae is correct.

26:43.936 --> 26:44.936
 I was watching it.

26:44.936 --> 26:45.936
 3 points.

26:45.936 --> 26:46.936
 Julia is correct.

26:46.936 --> 26:47.936
 Aki is correct.

26:47.936 --> 26:53.456
 Thank you for watching! Please

26:54.456 --> 26:55.456

26:58.456 --> 27:00.456
 We are very close.

27:07.008 --> 27:09.008
 Let's move on to the next question.

27:09.008 --> 27:11.008
 Here is the next question.

27:11.008 --> 27:13.008
 What is Kuro's favorite food?

27:13.008 --> 27:15.008
 I don't know.

27:15.008 --> 27:17.008
 I don't know.

27:17.008 --> 27:19.008
 I don't know.

27:19.008 --> 27:21.008
 I don't know.

27:21.008 --> 27:23.008
 Please tell us.

27:25.008 --> 27:27.008
 I've been craving it lately.

27:27.008 --> 27:29.008
 Lately?

27:29.008 --> 27:30.160
 I don't know.

27:31.160 --> 27:33.160
 For my family?

27:33.160 --> 27:35.160
 Because I like my sister.

27:35.160 --> 27:37.160
 It's not for family.

27:37.160 --> 27:40.160
 I feel like I'm wrong.

27:40.160 --> 27:41.160
 Let's go.

27:41.160 --> 27:43.160
 Please give us the answer.

27:43.160 --> 27:44.160
 Ready, go.

27:45.160 --> 27:47.160
 Oatmeal gratin.

27:47.160 --> 27:48.160
 Meat bun.

27:48.160 --> 27:50.160
 Oatmeal gratin.

27:53.624 --> 27:56.624
 Please show us the video.

27:58.624 --> 28:00.624
 What is your specialty?

28:00.624 --> 28:07.624
 Hito-chan's... No, my specialty is...

28:08.864 --> 28:12.464
 Pumpkin soup and hamburger!

28:12.464 --> 28:18.464
 I'm told to make these two dishes.

28:18.464 --> 28:22.464
 I think I'll like them if I make them.

28:22.464 --> 28:24.464
 That's my specialty.

28:24.464 --> 28:26.464
 Why are you all drinking?

28:26.464 --> 28:28.464
 I'm sorry.

28:28.464 --> 28:31.464
 I've heard of it.

28:31.464 --> 28:33.464
 I've told you!

28:33.464 --> 28:35.464
 I've told you.

28:35.464 --> 28:39.464
 I like the hamburger of McDonald's.

28:39.464 --> 28:43.464
 Which one?

28:43.464 --> 28:47.464
 I like McDonald's hamburger.

28:47.464 --> 28:49.464
 I make it with that.

28:49.464 --> 28:55.464
 I like the pumpkin soup every autumn.

28:57.464 --> 29:01.464
 So, it was pumpkin soup and hamburger!

29:01.464 --> 29:03.464
 The answer is...

29:03.464 --> 29:05.464
 It was melon!

29:05.464 --> 29:07.464
 Bye!

29:07.464 --> 29:09.464
 Hito-chan is shocked!

29:09.464 --> 29:13.464
 Everyone knows about Hito-chan!

29:13.464 --> 29:15.464
 Hito-chan will cry!

29:15.464 --> 29:17.464
 Hito-chan is shocked!

29:17.464 --> 29:19.464
 Please come back next time!

29:22.464 --> 29:24.464
 Let's go!

29:24.464 --> 29:26.464
 Here we go!

29:26.464 --> 29:31.464
 What's the juice that you liked as a
kid and as a high schooler?

29:31.464 --> 29:34.464
 Juice?

29:34.464 --> 29:35.464
 Juice?

29:35.464 --> 29:37.464
 Something delicious!

29:37.464 --> 29:38.464
 Something healthy?

29:38.464 --> 29:39.464
 Something delicious!

29:39.464 --> 29:41.464
 You said it!

29:41.464 --> 29:43.464
 Juice?

29:43.464 --> 29:47.464
 When I was a kid, I didn't like sweet
stuff.

29:47.464 --> 29:50.464
 I didn't like whipped cream.

29:50.464 --> 29:54.464
 I didn't like sweet stuff.

29:54.464 --> 29:58.464
 But I started to like sweet stuff when
I was a high schooler.

29:58.464 --> 30:00.464
 I'm a high schooler.

30:00.602 --> 30:02.602
 It's sweet.

30:02.602 --> 30:03.602
 It's light.

30:03.602 --> 30:04.602
 It's sweet.

30:04.602 --> 30:05.602
 Is it not here?

30:05.602 --> 30:10.602
 I started to look at it since I was in
high school.

30:10.602 --> 30:13.602
 And then I started to drink it.

30:13.602 --> 30:14.602
 I said too much.

30:14.602 --> 30:17.664
 I was like, this?

30:18.664 --> 30:19.664
 I usually say it.

30:20.664 --> 30:22.664
 Let's see the first question.

30:24.664 --> 30:25.664
 Cocoa? Milk tea?

30:25.664 --> 30:26.664
 Frappuccino?

30:26.664 --> 30:27.664
 Mascarpone?

30:27.664 --> 30:28.664
 Milk tea?

30:28.664 --> 30:29.664
 Let's do it again.

30:29.664 --> 30:30.664
 Cocoa?

30:30.664 --> 30:31.664
 Milk tea?

30:31.664 --> 30:32.664
 Frappuccino?

30:32.664 --> 30:33.664
 Mascarpone?

30:33.664 --> 30:34.664
 Milk tea?

30:35.664 --> 30:36.664
 Let's do it again.

30:37.664 --> 30:38.664
 I agree.

30:38.664 --> 30:40.664
 I don't drink it when I was little.

30:42.664 --> 30:43.664
 You're right.

30:43.664 --> 30:45.664
 I agree with you.

30:45.664 --> 30:46.664
 I don't drink it.

30:46.664 --> 30:49.664
 Please give me a comment.

30:52.152 --> 30:57.152
 I didn't like it when I was a kid, but
what's your favorite juice since high
school?

31:03.152 --> 31:05.152
 Cream soda!

31:06.152 --> 31:14.152
 I was a little bit tired when I was a
kid.

31:14.152 --> 31:21.152
 I didn't like it when I was a kid, but
it became popular when I was a high
school student.

31:22.152 --> 31:26.152
 I thought it was good and tried it.

31:27.152 --> 31:29.152
 I liked it since high school.

31:31.152 --> 31:33.152
 I've never seen you drink it.

31:35.152 --> 31:37.152
 I drank it at a cafe.

31:38.152 --> 31:40.152
 I drank it at a cafe.

31:40.152 --> 31:42.152
 I drank it at a lesson.

31:43.152 --> 31:44.152
 It's a little bit weird.

31:44.152 --> 31:47.152
 I drank Royal Milk Tea the other day.

31:50.872 --> 31:51.872
 Who is it?

31:52.872 --> 31:53.872
 Who is it?

31:53.872 --> 31:55.872
 If you say it's me, it's Royal Milk
Tea.

32:00.872 --> 32:01.872
 Next question.

32:02.872 --> 32:03.872
 This one is easy.

32:04.872 --> 32:05.872
 Here we go.

32:06.872 --> 32:10.872
 What is Hitochan's favorite food?

32:12.872 --> 32:16.872
 She eats a lot and she's particular
about it.

32:16.872 --> 32:18.872
 I'm not sure.

32:19.258 --> 32:22.258
 What? Bread?

32:22.258 --> 32:24.258
 Bread?

32:25.840 --> 32:27.840
 I wonder if it's the same as the normal
one.

32:27.840 --> 32:28.840
 I wonder.

32:28.840 --> 32:30.840
 I'm sure everyone eats it often.

32:30.840 --> 32:31.840
 Everyone?

32:31.840 --> 32:32.840
 Everyone eats it often.

32:33.840 --> 32:34.840
 It's a variety.

32:34.840 --> 32:35.840
 I'll eat it.

32:35.840 --> 32:36.840
 Did you eat it?

32:36.840 --> 32:37.840
 Yes.

32:37.840 --> 32:40.840
 Then, please answer together.

32:40.840 --> 32:41.840
 One, two, three.

32:41.840 --> 32:42.840
 What is it?

32:42.840 --> 32:45.840
 Melon bread with chocolate Pokemon
sticker.

32:46.840 --> 32:47.840
 Bread.

32:47.840 --> 32:48.840
 Croissant.

32:48.840 --> 32:49.840
 Steamed bread.

32:49.840 --> 32:50.840
 Tamon bread.

32:50.840 --> 32:51.840
 Oh, that's right.

32:51.840 --> 32:53.840
 But I can't eat it.

32:53.840 --> 32:53.984
 I can't eat it.

32:54.984 --> 32:59.984
 What is your favorite bread?

33:00.984 --> 33:03.984
 I love bread. I eat a lot of bread.

33:04.984 --> 33:07.984
 I like bread the most.

33:08.984 --> 33:12.984
 My mom always buys me delicious bread.

33:13.984 --> 33:16.984
 I'm happy to eat delicious bread.

33:17.984 --> 33:19.984
 So the answer was bread.

33:19.984 --> 33:22.984
 I ate it this morning.

33:23.984 --> 33:26.984
 Julia is correct.

33:27.984 --> 33:29.984
 I like egg bread.

33:30.984 --> 33:32.984
 I like steamed bread.

33:33.984 --> 33:37.984
 I often buy steamed bread at the
station.

33:38.984 --> 33:39.984
 I eat it.

33:40.984 --> 33:41.984
 I also like croissant.

33:42.984 --> 33:44.984
 Croissant is delicious.

33:45.984 --> 33:46.984
 I eat it often.

33:46.984 --> 33:49.984
 Julia is correct.

33:50.984 --> 33:51.984
 I'm happy.

33:52.984 --> 33:56.984
 Julia and Kanae got 3 points.

33:57.984 --> 33:58.984
 Oharu and Aki got 2 points.

33:58.984 --> 34:03.984
 Hiyorin got 1 point.

34:07.192 --> 34:09.192
 Yorin got 2 points.

34:10.192 --> 34:12.192
 How many points did I get?

34:13.192 --> 34:14.192
 2 points.

34:15.192 --> 34:18.192
 I got 2 points.

34:18.192 --> 34:21.632
 Thank you for watching.

34:22.632 --> 34:23.632
 I'm sure I used it.

34:24.632 --> 34:25.632
 I'm sure I used it.

34:26.632 --> 34:30.632
 I'm sorry, but I didn't know the final
question until today.

34:31.632 --> 34:32.632
 I'll show you.

34:33.632 --> 34:35.632
 I'm going to show you the final
question.

34:36.632 --> 34:41.632
 How long does it take for Fuku-chan to
get up and leave the house?

34:42.632 --> 34:43.632
 Please answer.

34:44.632 --> 34:45.632
 What do you mean by time?

34:45.632 --> 34:51.632
 I measured the time it took to get up
and leave the house.

34:52.632 --> 34:53.632
 Why do you measure it like a math?

34:55.632 --> 34:56.632
 I measured the time it took to get up
and leave the house.

34:57.632 --> 34:58.632
 I opened the front door.

34:58.632 --> 35:01.632
 I opened the front door.

35:03.624 --> 35:04.624
 I can't answer anything.

35:05.624 --> 35:06.624
 Did you have lunch?

35:09.624 --> 35:11.624
 I just had a meal.

35:11.624 --> 35:12.624
 I just had a meal.

35:12.624 --> 35:16.208
 I just had a meal.

35:16.208 --> 35:18.208
 It's been a week.

35:18.208 --> 35:20.208
 I'm tired.

35:24.208 --> 35:26.208
 It's time.

35:26.208 --> 35:28.208
 Did you write it?

35:28.208 --> 35:30.208
 Please write your answers.

35:32.208 --> 35:34.208
 3 hours and 30 minutes.

35:34.208 --> 35:36.208
 2 hours and 40 minutes.

35:36.208 --> 35:38.208
 2 hours and 45 minutes.

35:38.208 --> 35:40.208
 You wrote it.

35:40.208 --> 35:42.208
 I'm tired.

35:42.208 --> 35:44.208
 By the way,

35:44.208 --> 35:46.208
 did you get up before you went out?

35:46.208 --> 35:48.208
 I think so.

35:48.208 --> 35:50.208
 I think I got up around 2 hours ago.

35:50.208 --> 35:52.208
 Did you get up?

35:52.208 --> 35:54.208
 Yes.

35:54.208 --> 35:56.208
 I slept a lot.

35:56.208 --> 35:57.632
 I'm tired.

35:58.632 --> 35:59.632
 3 hours?

36:01.632 --> 36:02.632
 How about you, Aki?

36:02.632 --> 36:03.632
 8 hours.

36:03.632 --> 36:05.632
 I woke up at 4am.

36:05.632 --> 36:06.632
 You are young.

36:06.632 --> 36:08.632
 No, I'm not.

36:08.632 --> 36:09.632
 What are you doing?

36:09.632 --> 36:10.632
 My grandma is sleeping.

36:10.632 --> 36:11.632
 I'm sleeping too.

36:11.632 --> 36:13.632
 That's your grandma.

36:16.632 --> 36:17.632
 You are a troublemaker.

36:17.632 --> 36:18.632
 I'm fine.

36:19.632 --> 36:21.632
 Well, everyone.

36:21.632 --> 36:23.632
 As a fighter dancer,

36:23.632 --> 36:27.632
 I'll do my best.

36:30.376 --> 36:33.376
 What time did you get up and leave the
house?

36:34.376 --> 36:38.376
 What time did I get up and leave the
house?

36:38.376 --> 36:44.376
 I got up at 4 o'clock.

36:46.024 --> 36:49.024
 I think you all have the same image as
me.

36:49.024 --> 36:51.024
 You often say that you got up at 10
minutes and got ready.

36:51.024 --> 36:54.024
 I think you have the same image.

36:54.024 --> 36:57.024
 I didn't get up early today.

36:57.024 --> 37:02.024
 I got up early in the morning, but I
got up at 4 o'clock.

37:04.024 --> 37:05.024
 I'm alone.

37:06.024 --> 37:09.024
 So, I was the first to get up early.

37:09.024 --> 37:11.024
 I did it.

37:11.024 --> 37:13.024
 You are weak.

37:13.024 --> 37:16.024
 I got up at 8 o'clock and got up at 12
o'clock.

37:18.024 --> 37:20.024
 So, I got up at 4 o'clock.

37:24.024 --> 37:28.024
 I usually get up at 30 minutes early.

37:30.024 --> 37:33.024
 I got up a little late today.

37:33.024 --> 37:35.024
 So, I got up at 4 o'clock.

37:37.024 --> 37:39.024
 So, we are the first to get up early.

37:39.024 --> 37:42.024
 We are the second to get up early.

37:44.024 --> 37:47.024
 That's all for the questions.

37:47.024 --> 37:48.024
 The result is...

37:48.024 --> 37:53.024
 Kanami 3 points, Julia 3 points, Ohami
4 points, Aki 2 points, Hiyorin...

37:55.024 --> 38:00.024
 So, the last place of the Hitokao
competition is...

38:00.024 --> 38:12.024
 We have been together for 6 years and
graduated from the same high school.

38:16.024 --> 38:18.024
 Someone is going to collapse.

38:21.024 --> 38:25.024
 We have been together for 6 years and
graduated from the same high school.

38:25.024 --> 38:35.024
 Hiyori, who came to see my photo album
yesterday, is the last place.

38:38.024 --> 38:40.024
 The winner is...

38:40.024 --> 38:45.952
 The winner is...

38:45.952 --> 38:47.952
 How do you feel now?

38:47.952 --> 38:49.952
 I've been with you for a long time.

38:49.952 --> 38:51.952
 I know.

38:51.952 --> 38:53.952
 You're a good girl.

38:53.952 --> 38:55.952
 You know me well.

38:55.952 --> 38:57.952
 I feel like I'm winning.

38:57.952 --> 38:59.952
 But you and Julia are...

38:59.952 --> 39:01.952
 Yes.

39:01.952 --> 39:05.952
 If it wasn't for the points, we would
have been tied.

39:05.952 --> 39:07.952
 We were tied.

39:07.952 --> 39:09.952
 We were.

39:09.952 --> 39:11.952
 We were tied.

39:11.952 --> 39:13.952
 But we're tied.

39:13.952 --> 39:17.952
 You got 2 points for the action.

39:20.840 --> 39:22.840
 You still have a year to go, but you
still got 2 points.

39:25.840 --> 39:26.840
 I don't know.

39:27.840 --> 39:28.840
 You got it wrong.

39:30.840 --> 39:36.840
 If you got the first love right, you
and Aki-chan would be the same.

39:36.840 --> 39:42.448
 That's a problem of the brain.

39:43.448 --> 39:47.448
 I like the dojo, but I'm not good at
it.

39:49.448 --> 39:51.448
 I'm actually bored.

39:56.448 --> 39:59.448
 If Hiyorin is the last, you'll have to
play a penalty game.

40:02.448 --> 40:09.448
 You'll have to imitate my favorite
character, Haul.

40:09.448 --> 40:18.448
 Haul is very cool, so I hope you'll
imitate me.

40:18.448 --> 40:31.448
 Please use the lines you come up with.

40:34.042 --> 40:38.042
 It's a dance of moving the pole.

40:38.042 --> 40:44.042
 Sofiii!

40:44.042 --> 40:46.042
 Sofii, where are you?

40:46.042 --> 40:48.042
 Sofii!

40:48.042 --> 40:51.042
 Sofii, come on!

40:51.042 --> 40:55.042
 Sofii!

40:55.584 --> 40:56.584
 You!

40:56.584 --> 41:00.584
 No, we were definitely dating in the
past.

41:00.584 --> 41:08.584
 But you were bewitched by a strange
witch and became like that.

41:08.584 --> 41:12.584
 I love you!

41:12.584 --> 41:13.584
 Me too.

41:13.584 --> 41:14.584
 Yeah.

41:14.584 --> 41:18.584
 So, Sofii, even if you become like
that,

41:18.584 --> 41:20.464
 I'll be waiting for you.

41:21.464 --> 41:25.464
 Howl, Howl loves you.

41:25.464 --> 41:35.200
 So, why don't you live in my castle,
Howl's moving castle?

41:36.200 --> 41:40.200
 Howl's castle.

41:41.200 --> 41:43.200
 Thank you.

41:44.200 --> 41:46.200
 See you next week.

41:47.200 --> 41:48.200
 Bye-bye.

41:49.200 --> 41:50.200
 Bye-bye.

41:53.200 --> 41:54.200
 Stop it!

41:55.200 --> 41:56.200
 No?

41:57.200 --> 41:58.200
 That's a kiss scene.

41:58.200 --> 42:01.200
 Please subscribe to our channel.

42:02.376 --> 42:04.376
 So, what is it?

42:04.376 --> 42:07.376
 Sofie will kiss Haru.

42:07.376 --> 42:08.376
 So, Haru, what?

42:09.376 --> 42:10.376
 Haru, what?

42:10.376 --> 42:11.376
 What?

42:19.354 --> 42:21.354
 Thank you very much!

42:21.354 --> 42:23.354
 Thank you!

42:25.354 --> 42:27.354
 Bye-bye!

42:27.354 --> 42:35.354
 I hope we can continue to create
wonderful scenery together!

42:42.490 --> 42:45.230
 That day it should actually, happen

42:51.630 --> 42:54.890
 I think I will have the right to get my
dream

42:55.090 --> 42:56.970
 The real me

42:57.130 --> 43:00.930
 It should finally, happen

43:01.130 --> 43:03.470
 Right now is the perfect hour

43:03.630 --> 43:05.510
 To reach out for your hand

43:05.870 --> 43:07.350
 So don't get lost

43:07.510 --> 43:08.768
 You can push through

43:08.768 --> 43:11.768
 I want to erase the truth

43:11.768 --> 43:16.268
 The more I run, the more I get

43:16.268 --> 43:18.768
 Today is brighter than anything

43:18.768 --> 43:20.768
 I want to erase the feelings

43:21.434 --> 43:23.434
 Pyon! Pyon!

43:24.434 --> 43:26.434
 Let's start!

43:26.434 --> 43:28.434
 Hello!

43:28.434 --> 43:31.434
 If you got the best score,

43:32.434 --> 43:35.434
 If you think Hiori's haul was cool,

43:36.434 --> 43:40.434
 Please subscribe and click the good
button!

43:40.434 --> 43:50.434
 I'm waiting for your comments!

43:50.938 --> 43:56.338
 I want to share my feelings with you

43:56.338 --> 44:00.938
 There's still a view I've never seen
before

44:00.938 --> 44:05.938
 Let's go anywhere

44:07.396 --> 44:09.396
 Goodbye, goodbye

44:09.396 --> 44:11.396
 Thank you for yesterday

44:11.396 --> 44:15.396
 The city after the rain is colorful

44:15.396 --> 44:19.396
 Draw a piece of the future on the
canvas of my damaged heart

44:19.396 --> 44:23.396
 It will guide me

44:39.770 --> 44:44.770
 Now is the night, and the reason for my
tears

44:44.770 --> 44:48.770
 When I'm lost, I remember right away

44:48.770 --> 44:52.770
 Even if it rains, I'll smile

44:52.770 --> 44:56.770
 Look, let's go anywhere

44:56.770 --> 45:00.770
 Goodbye, goodbye, to me of yesterday

45:00.770 --> 45:04.770
 The city lights after the rain are
sparkling

45:04.770 --> 45:08.770
 My heart is like a sunny day, the sound
of the rain drops

45:08.770 --> 45:12.770
 I play the rainbow piano

45:12.770 --> 45:17.770
 Goodbye, goodbye, to me of yesterday

45:17.770 --> 45:21.770
 The city lights after the rain are
sparkling

45:21.770 --> 45:25.770
 My heart is like a flower, the sound of
the rain drops

45:25.770 --> 45:41.050
 I wear a rainbow dress

45:41.050 --> 45:43.050
 La la la la la la

45:50.138 --> 45:52.138
 Thank you for watching!
