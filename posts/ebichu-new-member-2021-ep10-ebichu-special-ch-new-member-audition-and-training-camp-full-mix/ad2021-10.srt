3 new members stood on the stage after passing the 3rd, 4th day of the school
camp audition

7
00:00:50,298 --> 00:00:53,298
They were talking about this

8
00:00:54,298 --> 00:00:58,298
I hope that I can blow a new wind

9
00:00:58,298 --> 00:01:00,298
The feelings of Ebichu

10
00:01:01,298 --> 00:01:05,298
This time, they will deliver an unreleased interview

11
00:01:05,298 --> 00:01:07,298
Furthermore

12
00:01:07,298 --> 00:01:10,138
I want to go home

13
00:01:10,138 --> 00:01:15,138
Great performance by everyев pancakes Meev mu!

14
00:01:25,946 --> 00:01:28,946
First, we have Sakuragi Kokona.

15
00:01:29,824 --> 00:01:40,824
I am very happy that I got to know that you are a great senior that I respect.

16
00:01:40,824 --> 00:01:49,824
I watched a lot of videos from that time and got into it.

17
00:01:49,824 --> 00:01:52,824
I want to go to the singing and vocal training.

18
00:01:52,824 --> 00:01:56,824
I really want to join you.

19
00:01:56,824 --> 00:02:05,824
I want to be a cool idol when I join you.

20
00:02:05,824 --> 00:02:15,472
I am good at dancing, so I want to show you how to dance.

21
00:02:15,472 --> 00:02:18,472
Next is Nonoka Kazami.

22
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:22,760
I like singing and dancing since I was a child.

23
00:02:22,760 --> 00:02:26,760
I like K-pop idol, Twice.

24
00:02:26,760 --> 00:02:28,760
I remember and dance.

25
00:02:28,760 --> 00:02:34,760
I heard from the manager that there is an audition for every girl idol.

26
00:02:34,760 --> 00:02:38,760
Cute and cool are different.

27
00:02:38,760 --> 00:02:41,760
I thought it was amazing.

28
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:49,760
I want to be an idol that people of the same generation can admire.

29
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:53,760
Next is Yuno Kokubo.

30
00:02:53,760 --> 00:03:03,760
I like prose and Gagakara ideal and listen Então

31
00:03:03,776 --> 00:03:05,776
I like idols too

32
00:03:05,776 --> 00:03:08,776
They are cool and cute

33
00:03:08,776 --> 00:03:13,776
I want to be an idol who makes people smile naturally

34
00:03:14,776 --> 00:03:21,776
They have overcome many challenges to become the most admired Ebi-Chu

35
00:03:23,776 --> 00:03:27,776
At this time, they didn't know that they would become new members

36
00:03:27,776 --> 00:03:32,776
At the end of the training camp, they talked about this

37
00:03:32,992 --> 00:03:37,992
I thought that I was able to finish without any regrets.

38
00:03:37,992 --> 00:03:44,992
I had some parts where I missed the lyrics, but I felt like I could do it.

39
00:03:44,992 --> 00:03:47,992
I was able to do my best until the end.

40
00:03:47,992 --> 00:03:55,992
Through this camp, the three members of the group,

41
00:03:55,992 --> 00:04:02,992
we were able to get along and teach each other.

42
00:04:02,992 --> 00:04:05,992
We were able to do it together.

43
00:04:05,992 --> 00:04:15,992
I learned that I can do what I'm good at.

44
00:04:15,992 --> 00:04:22,992
I can't imagine it yet, but I'm really happy to be able to do it.

45
00:04:22,992 --> 00:04:25,992
It was like we were together for a month or two.

46
00:04:25,992 --> 00:04:30,224
Everyone was really friendly and it was fun.

47
00:04:30,224 --> 00:04:32,224
Did you do your best?

48
00:04:32,224 --> 00:04:36,224
I did my best. But I think I could have done better.

49
00:04:36,224 --> 00:04:41,224
I was laughing even though I was bad at dancing.

50
00:04:41,224 --> 00:04:44,224
I think that's amazing.

51
00:04:44,224 --> 00:04:49,224
I didn't have any problems.

52
00:04:49,224 --> 00:04:55,904
I just wanted to do my best next time.

53
00:04:55,904 --> 00:04:58,904
And the youngest Nonoka is...

54
00:04:59,904 --> 00:05:01,904
I have never done anything before.

55
00:05:02,904 --> 00:05:09,904
I was taught to dance and sing by the same team members, like Kokona and Aika.

56
00:05:09,904 --> 00:05:15,104
I think I did well.

57
00:05:15,104 --> 00:05:20,864
I was able to meet the real Ebichu and talk to her.

58
00:05:20,944 --> 00:05:23,604
I also learned her songs and dances.

59
00:05:23,684 --> 00:05:29,024
I want to become Ebichu.

60
00:05:29,024 --> 00:05:40,604
I will do my best to make a new wind blow.

61
00:05:40,656 --> 00:05:45,656
With this feeling in their hearts, the three of them became the new members of
Shirito Ebichu Gakku.

62
00:05:46,656 --> 00:05:50,656
In the next episode of ZEMO-RIMIX, we will continue to follow the new members.

63
00:05:50,656 --> 00:05:52,656
Please look forward to it!

64
00:05:54,656 --> 00:05:59,656
And this time, we will show you the unreleased footage of the training camp.

65
00:05:59,656 --> 00:06:01,656
And that is...

66
00:06:02,656 --> 00:06:05,656
Ebichu members who were watching the live broadcast comments.

67
00:06:05,656 --> 00:06:10,656
And that is...

68
00:06:11,874 --> 00:06:13,874
I want to see the feeling of wearing the sneakers

69
00:06:14,874 --> 00:06:17,874
We thought we would do it yesterday

70
00:06:17,874 --> 00:06:19,874
We thought we would do it

71
00:06:19,874 --> 00:06:22,874
We wore these sneakers

72
00:06:24,874 --> 00:06:26,874
To meet the fans' request

73
00:06:26,874 --> 00:06:34,048
We will show you the song of the training camp, Paita Teki

74
00:06:34,048 --> 00:06:37,788

75
00:06:37,948 --> 00:06:39,508
