01:36.144 --> 01:37.144
 Cute.

01:38.144 --> 01:41.144
 Next, Hokkaido's hot cheese.

01:42.144 --> 01:44.144
 I've never seen this before.

01:48.144 --> 01:49.144
 Looks delicious.

01:51.144 --> 01:53.144
 Yubari melon langdosa.

01:55.144 --> 01:58.144
 Haru, you always say langdosa.

01:58.144 --> 02:00.144

like?

02:01.144 --> 02:03.144
 Melon langdosa.

02:05.144 --> 02:07.144

scallop.

 This is also a scallop.

02:14.144 --> 02:16.144
 I ate the red one.

02:16.144 --> 02:18.144
 There was a blue one.

02:19.144 --> 02:20.144
 It's salted scallop.

02:20.144 --> 02:22.144
 I will buy this as a souvenir.

02:22.144 --> 02:27.144

03:26.970 --> 03:28.970
 I'm going to put it on my hand.

03:28.970 --> 03:30.970
 It's like a man.

03:30.970 --> 03:32.970
 It's like a man.

03:32.970 --> 03:34.970
 It's scary.

03:40.970 --> 03:42.970
 What is that?

03:42.970 --> 03:44.970
 It's a different one.

03:44.970 --> 03:46.970
 It's a different one.

03:46.970 --> 03:48.970
 I'm going to put it on my hand.

04:16.098 --> 04:18.098
 Odan-go!

04:18.098 --> 04:20.098
 It's a little unusual hairstyle.

04:20.098 --> 04:29.098
 I'll do my best for the rehearsal after
this!

04:29.274 --> 04:31.274
 I put on my nails.

04:31.274 --> 04:33.274
 Pink.

04:33.274 --> 04:36.274
 It's a matcha cider with salt candy.

04:36.274 --> 04:50.138
 Thank you for watching!

04:50.138 --> 04:52.138
 I want to be alone with you

04:52.138 --> 04:57.138
 I want to kiss you on a date in a
lady's dress

04:57.138 --> 05:00.138
 I just want to see you smile

05:00.138 --> 05:06.138
 Don't say that everyone's heart is
broken

05:06.138 --> 05:08.138
 Where are you?

05:08.138 --> 05:11.138
 Where are you?

05:11.138 --> 05:13.138

05:52.442 --> 05:54.062

 Just as the two of us

05:55.442 --> 05:57.442

05:57.442 --> 05:58.722
 Sounds good!

06:01.680 --> 06:10.640

 I'm going to be a black-haired girl.

06:46.530 --> 06:47.530
 Nice to meet you.

06:51.530 --> 06:52.530
 Is it over?

06:53.530 --> 06:55.530
 Is the rehearsal over?

06:56.530 --> 06:58.530
 I'm a little nervous.

06:59.530 --> 07:02.530
 I'm sweating a lot today.

07:03.530 --> 07:06.530
 I might sweat again on the actual
stage.

07:06.530 --> 07:10.530
 I'm nervous today, too.

07:20.986 --> 07:22.986
 Thank you for watching.

07:34.810 --> 07:37.810
 I like chocolate and sugar.

07:39.810 --> 07:43.810
 Which do you like more, chocolate or
sugar?

07:43.810 --> 07:44.810
 I don't know.

07:45.810 --> 07:47.810
 I like both.

08:13.522 --> 08:15.522
 It's salty and soy sauce flavor.

08:18.522 --> 08:19.522
 It's fried chicken.

08:20.522 --> 08:21.522
 It looks delicious.

08:23.522 --> 08:24.522
 I'll eat it.

08:27.522 --> 08:28.522
 I got it.

08:28.522 --> 08:34.522
 Thank you for watching.

08:36.584 --> 08:37.584
 Look at this!

08:38.584 --> 08:40.584

08:41.584 --> 08:43.584
 We can consume it in a live.

08:44.584 --> 08:45.584
 Awesome!

08:45.584 --> 08:48.584
 We can consume it in a live.

08:50.584 --> 08:51.584
 Let's eat!

08:51.584 --> 08:52.584
 This is the standard.

08:52.584 --> 09:01.584
 Let's enjoy the standard.

09:05.376 --> 09:07.376
 I'm not happy.

09:08.376 --> 09:10.376
 I'm not happy.

09:11.376 --> 09:12.376
 Did you find it?

09:13.376 --> 09:15.376
 I'm not sure.

09:15.376 --> 09:17.376
 What is your favorite food?

09:17.376 --> 09:21.376
 I'll eat the cake.

09:28.794 --> 09:30.794
 It's been a while since I've been to
Sapporo.

09:30.794 --> 09:32.794
 I'm at Sapporo.

09:34.794 --> 09:37.794
 Kuromi-chan is here for the first time
today.

09:37.794 --> 09:39.794
 I'm going to do my best.

09:39.794 --> 09:40.794
 I'm going to do my best.

09:40.794 --> 09:42.794
 I'm going to do my best.

09:42.794 --> 09:52.474
 I can only come here once a year.

09:52.474 --> 10:02.474
 Thank you for coming to the 7th Heart
Gyutto Tour 2022 at Sanrio Characters, a
super-exciting advertising club!

10:05.402 --> 10:09.402
 I'm Kanami of the super hot blue, and
I'm also the red-haired girl.

10:09.402 --> 10:14.402
 Before we start, I'd like to ask the
audience to be careful of the line.

10:14.402 --> 10:19.402
 It's been about a year since we've had
a live show in Hokkaido!

10:21.402 --> 10:26.402
 We were really looking forward to it,
so let's make the best memories
together!

10:26.402 --> 10:33.402
 And today, everyone, including the
members' hair, is so cute, so look
forward to it!

10:33.402 --> 10:36.402

 I'm so happy.

11:13.726 --> 11:15.566
 Next GyouZZ

11:15.566 --> 11:21.562
 I thought of things that no one else
knew about

11:21.562 --> 11:26.562
 I can't help it, so goodbye

11:26.562 --> 11:32.562
 The important things are always by my
side

11:32.562 --> 11:37.562
 It's overflowing so much that I don't
want it

11:37.562 --> 11:43.562
 I read the first page of the booklet

11:43.562 --> 11:49.562
 【 translation by ロリコ】

 It's over.

12:03.690 --> 12:05.690
 It's amazing.

12:05.690 --> 12:11.690
 If you put it in your closet, you'll be
surprised.

12:14.408 --> 12:15.408
 This is a cheesecake.

12:16.408 --> 12:18.408
 I'm going to eat it after the concert.

12:21.408 --> 12:23.408
 My teacher made a cake set.

12:24.408 --> 12:27.408
 I was so happy when I found out that
there was this.

12:29.408 --> 12:30.408
 This is a cheese tart.

12:32.408 --> 12:33.408
 I love this.

12:36.408 --> 12:39.408
 I love cheese tart.

12:39.408 --> 12:43.408

12:47.408 --> 12:48.408
 I'm going to eat it.

12:57.626 --> 13:01.626
 Look! Can you see it?

13:01.626 --> 13:05.626
 It's definitely delicious!

13:16.980 --> 13:25.680
 「M Connie's Concert Set amazing
people!」

13:28.560 --> 13:32.700
 After the climax which everyone in the
cloud did not expect,

13:33.360 --> 13:39.120
 finally the location has finally
arrived!

13:39.120 --> 13:43.120
 We want to deliver the excitement of
the next generation to as many people as
possible.

13:43.120 --> 13:47.120
 We want to step up to the tour through
this Makuhari Messe.

13:47.120 --> 13:51.120
 We want to improve our performance so
that we can live up to this venue.

13:51.120 --> 13:55.120
 I'm really looking forward to seeing
the smiles of the young people.

13:55.120 --> 13:59.120
 I want to make a lot of memories.

14:01.120 --> 14:03.120
 October 22nd is...

14:03.120 --> 14:04.120
 Let's go!

14:04.120 --> 14:05.120
 Special!

14:05.120 --> 14:07.120

14:07.120 --> 14:09.120
 See you!

14:17.626 --> 14:30.522
 Please subscribe to my channel!

14:30.522 --> 14:32.522
 I wonder why

14:32.576 --> 14:38.576
 When I smile, it's like the world is
shining

14:38.576 --> 14:42.576
 I can turn my umbrella and feel relaxed

14:42.576 --> 14:46.576
 I can't walk without it

14:46.576 --> 14:49.576
 I'm sure someone is crying somewhere

14:49.576 --> 14:51.576
 I'm sure someone is getting wet
somewhere

14:51.576 --> 14:55.576
 I wonder if it's cold

14:55.576 --> 14:57.576
 I'm sure someone is crying somewhere

14:57.576 --> 15:03.576
 I want to share my feelings with you

15:03.576 --> 15:07.576
 There's a new scenery in front of me

15:07.576 --> 15:12.576
 Let's go anywhere

15:14.100 --> 15:16.100
 Goodbye, goodbye

15:16.100 --> 15:18.100
 Thank you for yesterday

15:18.100 --> 15:22.100
 The city after the rain is colored

15:22.100 --> 15:24.100
 On the canvas of my damaged heart

15:24.100 --> 15:26.100
 I'll draw a fragment of the future

15:26.100 --> 15:30.100
 It will guide me

15:44.282 --> 15:48.282
 I can say it now, the reason for my
tears

15:48.282 --> 15:52.282
 When I'm lost, I remember it right away

15:52.282 --> 15:56.282
 Even if it rains, I'll smile

15:56.282 --> 16:00.282
 Look, let's go anywhere

16:00.282 --> 16:04.282
 Goodbye, goodbye, to me of yesterday

16:04.282 --> 16:08.282
 The city lights up after the rain

16:08.282 --> 16:12.282
 My heart is like a sunny day, I'm happy

16:12.282 --> 16:16.282
 My heart is like a sunny day, I ring
the bell of the rainbow

16:16.282 --> 16:20.282
 I play the rainbow piano

16:20.282 --> 16:24.282
 Goodbye, goodbye, to me of yesterday

16:24.282 --> 16:28.282
 The city lights up after the rain

16:28.282 --> 16:32.282
 My heart is like a sunny day, I shed
tears

16:32.282 --> 16:44.282
 I wear a rainbow dress

16:44.480 --> 16:49.200
 La la la la la la, la la la la la la la
