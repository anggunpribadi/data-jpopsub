1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Shrimp Chuu Tastas has started!

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,000
This time, the people who add shrimp to
Chuu are Indians.

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:13,000
Then, what is the reaction of this
science?

4
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,000
It's delicious with a good feeling of
spiciness.

5
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:26,362
Chuu Tastas starts!

6
00:00:54,650 --> 00:00:59,150
Which version did you use this time?

7
00:01:04,130 --> 00:01:08,090
Now, do you want to participate in the
subscriber event?

8
00:01:08,170 --> 00:01:13,600
If you're thinking about a 37-year-
oldIsn't there anything you like in the
world?

9
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:17,600
This program is sponsored by the sponsor
you are watching.

10
00:01:18,600 --> 00:01:21,600
Are you okay with the camera?

11
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:23,600
Nice? Good?

12
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:24,600
Good?

13
00:01:24,600 --> 00:01:25,600
Good!

14
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:31,600
This time, I, Kobayashi, will be the
host.

15
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:32,600
And...

16
00:01:32,600 --> 00:01:35,600
I'm the reporter, Shinta Kiyoto.

17
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:36,600
I'm Jue.

18
00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:43,232
I'm scared of the world, so I'll fly
away. Jue Jue Jue!

19
00:01:43,232 --> 00:01:45,232
Please take care of us.

20
00:01:46,232 --> 00:01:50,232
Kobayashi is the MC, but I'm worried.

21
00:01:50,232 --> 00:01:52,232
That's right. Are you okay?

22
00:01:52,232 --> 00:01:53,232
Are you okay?

23
00:01:53,232 --> 00:01:55,232
I'm okay.

24
00:01:56,232 --> 00:01:57,232
I'm worried.

25
00:01:58,232 --> 00:02:01,232
I borrowed a switch last time.

26
00:02:02,232 --> 00:02:03,232
How was it?

27
00:02:04,232 --> 00:02:05,232
It was fun.

28
00:02:06,232 --> 00:02:07,232
There are many switches.

29
00:02:07,232 --> 00:02:10,232
It's fun.

30
00:02:10,232 --> 00:02:12,232
I can't go any further.

31
00:02:13,232 --> 00:02:14,232
I'll give it to you.

32
00:02:14,232 --> 00:02:16,960
Please subscribe to our channel.

33
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:17,960
What?

34
00:02:19,660 --> 00:02:20,960
You just said you'd go back.

35
00:02:20,960 --> 00:02:22,960
We don't have time to talk.

36
00:02:22,960 --> 00:02:30,032
By the way, Kashiwagi is still in the
movie industry.

37
00:02:30,032 --> 00:02:32,672
So, what are we going to do today?

38
00:02:32,672 --> 00:02:36,872
By the way, what is the theme of this
time?

39
00:02:36,872 --> 00:02:40,272
Today, we came to the park of
Nishikasai.

40
00:02:40,272 --> 00:02:41,272
What is it?

41
00:02:41,272 --> 00:02:42,272
What is it?

42
00:02:42,272 --> 00:02:43,272
I got it!

43
00:02:43,272 --> 00:02:43,872
Matsuno!

44
00:02:43,872 --> 00:02:46,072
There is a dinosaur, so it's a dinosaur,
isn't it?

45
00:02:46,072 --> 00:02:49,272
There is a dinosaur in the back.

46
00:02:49,272 --> 00:02:51,272
Riko, do you have a good idea?

47
00:02:51,272 --> 00:02:53,272
Let's play tag with everyone.

48
00:02:53,272 --> 00:03:01,072
People are playing tag!

49
00:03:01,178 --> 00:03:03,178
This is a deja vu

50
00:03:03,178 --> 00:03:05,178
I saw it the other day

51
00:03:05,178 --> 00:03:07,968
That's right

52
00:03:07,968 --> 00:03:11,968
What are we going to do today?

53
00:03:11,968 --> 00:03:13,968
Let's play with the Onigakko

54
00:03:13,968 --> 00:03:15,968
Onigakko?

55
00:03:15,968 --> 00:03:17,968
Wait

56
00:03:17,968 --> 00:03:19,968
No, no

57
00:03:19,968 --> 00:03:21,968
Come back

58
00:03:21,968 --> 00:03:23,968
Come back

59
00:03:23,968 --> 00:03:25,968
Come back

60
00:03:25,968 --> 00:03:27,968
Everyone is surprised

61
00:03:27,968 --> 00:03:29,968
Chuu

62
00:03:29,968 --> 00:03:31,968
Young members are increasing

63
00:03:31,968 --> 00:03:33,968
Young members

64
00:03:33,968 --> 00:03:35,968
Sorry

65
00:03:35,968 --> 00:03:37,968
Bye

66
00:03:37,968 --> 00:03:39,968
Can you go?

67
00:03:39,968 --> 00:03:45,968
What are they going to do?

68
00:03:45,968 --> 00:03:49,968
Please announce the theme

69
00:03:49,968 --> 00:03:55,968
We are going to add Indians

70
00:03:55,968 --> 00:03:57,968
We are Indians

71
00:03:57,968 --> 00:03:59,968
Why are you adding Indians?

72
00:03:59,968 --> 00:04:01,968
I don't know

73
00:04:01,968 --> 00:04:05,968
Actually

74
00:04:05,968 --> 00:04:07,968
West

75
00:04:07,968 --> 00:04:09,968
West Sakai

76
00:04:09,968 --> 00:04:11,968
Sakai

77
00:04:11,968 --> 00:04:13,968
You didn't read it

78
00:04:13,968 --> 00:04:15,968
Actually, West Sakai

79
00:04:15,968 --> 00:04:17,968
Sakai

80
00:04:17,968 --> 00:04:19,968
I don't know

81
00:04:19,968 --> 00:04:21,968
West

82
00:04:21,968 --> 00:04:23,968
In Japan

83
00:04:23,968 --> 00:04:27,968
It's the city where the most Indians
live

84
00:04:27,968 --> 00:04:29,968
That's right

85
00:04:29,968 --> 00:04:31,968
You know it

86
00:04:31,968 --> 00:04:33,968
In Edogawa

87
00:04:33,968 --> 00:04:37,968
The city where the most Indians live

88
00:04:37,968 --> 00:04:39,968
There are about 2000 Indians

89
00:04:39,968 --> 00:04:41,968
In West Sakai

90
00:04:41,968 --> 00:04:43,968
It's called Little India

91
00:04:43,968 --> 00:04:45,968
If you look closely

92
00:04:45,968 --> 00:04:49,968
There are many Indians in the park

93
00:04:49,968 --> 00:04:51,968
Kobayashi

94
00:04:51,968 --> 00:04:57,968
Please interview the Indians

95
00:04:57,968 --> 00:04:59,968
I have an idea

96
00:04:59,968 --> 00:05:03,968
Let's ask the Indians

97
00:05:03,968 --> 00:05:07,968
Why are you becoming Kobayashi?

98
00:05:07,968 --> 00:05:13,968
Kobayashi Kaho plus interview with
Indians

99
00:05:13,968 --> 00:05:15,968
I'm going

100
00:05:15,968 --> 00:05:17,968
Good luck

101
00:05:17,968 --> 00:05:19,968
Good luck

102
00:05:19,968 --> 00:05:21,968
It's suspicious

103
00:05:21,968 --> 00:05:23,968
It's suspicious

104
00:05:23,968 --> 00:05:27,968
Are you okay with the camera?

105
00:05:27,968 --> 00:05:29,968
Are you okay?

106
00:05:29,968 --> 00:05:33,968
What are you doing now?

107
00:05:33,968 --> 00:05:37,968
We are talking about various things

108
00:05:37,968 --> 00:05:39,968
Nice? Good?

109
00:05:39,968 --> 00:05:41,968
Good

110
00:05:41,968 --> 00:05:43,968
What are you talking about?

111
00:05:43,968 --> 00:05:47,968
As you can see

112
00:05:47,968 --> 00:05:49,968
They are using the microphone as a
microphone

113
00:05:49,968 --> 00:05:53,968
They are brave

114
00:05:53,968 --> 00:05:55,968
They are getting along

115
00:05:55,968 --> 00:05:59,968
The interview is very hot

116
00:05:59,968 --> 00:06:03,968
Is it near here?

117
00:06:03,968 --> 00:06:07,968
I want you to do it quickly

118
00:06:07,968 --> 00:06:09,968
It's a little long

119
00:06:09,968 --> 00:06:13,968
The interview continues

120
00:06:13,968 --> 00:06:19,968
It's different from Japanese culture

121
00:06:19,968 --> 00:06:21,968
It's amazing

122
00:06:21,968 --> 00:06:23,968
Wolf

123
00:06:23,968 --> 00:06:27,968
It's a wolf

124
00:06:27,968 --> 00:06:31,968
Please try it at Yasumoto Wolf

125
00:06:31,968 --> 00:06:36,968
Kobayashi plus interview with Indians

126
00:06:36,968 --> 00:06:40,968
It's a wolf

127
00:06:40,968 --> 00:06:44,968
It's a wolf

128
00:06:44,968 --> 00:06:46,968
Is it over?

129
00:06:46,968 --> 00:06:48,968
Is it over?

130
00:06:48,968 --> 00:06:50,968
It's over

131
00:06:50,968 --> 00:06:52,968
Welcome back

132
00:06:52,968 --> 00:06:54,968
Welcome back

133
00:06:54,968 --> 00:06:56,968
What?

134
00:06:56,968 --> 00:07:00,968
What?

135
00:07:00,968 --> 00:07:06,968
Kobayashi Kaho plus interview with
Indians

136
00:07:06,968 --> 00:07:09,818
Thank you for watching

137
00:07:09,818 --> 00:07:14,818
So, the members came to this building

138
00:07:14,818 --> 00:07:17,818
What is here?

139
00:07:17,818 --> 00:07:21,818
Namaste

140
00:07:21,818 --> 00:07:24,818
Sorry for the noisy kids

141
00:07:24,818 --> 00:07:26,818
Great

142
00:07:26,818 --> 00:07:28,818
I've never seen this before

143
00:07:28,818 --> 00:07:32,818
Kobayashi came here after hearing from
Indians

144
00:07:32,818 --> 00:07:39,818
This is Suwagat Indian Bazar which is a
restaurant that serves Indian daily
necessities and food

145
00:07:39,818 --> 00:07:43,818
So, Kobayashi plus Ante is

146
00:07:43,818 --> 00:07:49,818
There is a shop of Indian goods in
Nishikasai

147
00:07:49,818 --> 00:07:51,818
Great

148
00:07:51,818 --> 00:07:54,818
Coconut

149
00:07:54,818 --> 00:07:56,818
I want this

150
00:07:56,818 --> 00:07:58,818
I love coconut

151
00:07:58,818 --> 00:08:00,818
What is this?

152
00:08:00,818 --> 00:08:02,818
This is the one I was impressed

153
00:08:02,818 --> 00:08:05,818
This is called Pan

154
00:08:05,818 --> 00:08:07,818
Pan? I can't understand

155
00:08:07,818 --> 00:08:09,818
Popcorn?

156
00:08:09,818 --> 00:08:11,818
What is that?

157
00:08:11,818 --> 00:08:15,818
This is rice flakes

158
00:08:15,818 --> 00:08:18,818
Can I taste it?

159
00:08:18,818 --> 00:08:23,856
It's good

160
00:08:23,856 --> 00:08:24,856
Wow

161
00:08:25,576 --> 00:08:27,576
What Kobayashi found is

162
00:08:27,576 --> 00:08:32,376
A popular Indian dessert made by drying
rice

163
00:08:33,396 --> 00:08:31,176
It's like a

164
00:08:35,176 --> 00:08:36,176
It's like a volleyball

165
00:08:39,696 --> 00:08:40,696
Wait a minute

166
00:08:40,696 --> 00:08:41,696
Not yet

167
00:08:41,696 --> 00:08:42,696
It's not yet

168
00:08:42,696 --> 00:08:43,696
It's too early to wait

169
00:08:43,696 --> 00:08:44,696
It's too early to wait

170
00:08:44,696 --> 00:08:46,696
Don't drop it

171
00:08:46,696 --> 00:08:48,696
Don't drop it

172
00:08:48,696 --> 00:08:51,696
Let's eat

173
00:08:51,696 --> 00:08:52,696
Yes

174
00:08:52,696 --> 00:08:54,696
Let's eat

175
00:08:54,696 --> 00:08:55,696
It's good

176
00:08:55,696 --> 00:08:56,696
It's good

177
00:08:56,696 --> 00:08:57,696
It's good

178
00:08:57,696 --> 00:08:58,696
It's good

179
00:08:58,696 --> 00:08:59,696
It's good

180
00:08:59,696 --> 00:09:00,696
It's good

181
00:09:00,696 --> 00:09:01,696
It's good

182
00:09:03,696 --> 00:09:04,696
It's the best

183
00:09:04,696 --> 00:09:06,696
It tastes like Indian

184
00:09:06,696 --> 00:09:07,696
It's good

185
00:09:07,696 --> 00:09:08,696
Eat this

186
00:09:08,696 --> 00:09:09,696
It's the best

187
00:09:09,696 --> 00:09:11,696
I ate beans

188
00:09:11,696 --> 00:09:12,696
Eat beans

189
00:09:12,696 --> 00:09:16,696
I ate rice

190
00:09:16,696 --> 00:09:17,696
Eat beans now

191
00:09:17,696 --> 00:09:22,696
We didn't touch it

192
00:09:22,696 --> 00:09:23,696
Shrimp Chuu Pass

193
00:09:23,696 --> 00:09:26,696
Indian bean dessert is

194
00:09:26,696 --> 00:09:28,696
Kobayashi, say it's good

195
00:09:28,696 --> 00:09:29,696
It's good

196
00:09:29,696 --> 00:09:30,696
It's good

197
00:09:32,696 --> 00:09:33,696
It's salty

198
00:09:35,696 --> 00:09:36,696
It's chewy

199
00:09:36,696 --> 00:09:37,696
It's chewy

200
00:09:37,696 --> 00:09:38,696
It's fragrant

201
00:09:38,696 --> 00:09:39,696
It's fragrant

202
00:09:39,696 --> 00:09:40,696
It's fragrant

203
00:09:40,696 --> 00:09:41,696
It's good

204
00:09:41,696 --> 00:09:42,696
How about Yatsumoto?

205
00:09:42,696 --> 00:09:44,696
It's like a seed of a seed

206
00:09:44,696 --> 00:09:45,696
It's soy

207
00:09:45,696 --> 00:09:46,696
It's soy

208
00:09:46,696 --> 00:09:48,696
Yes, it's a bean

209
00:09:48,696 --> 00:09:49,696
It's a bean

210
00:09:49,696 --> 00:09:50,696
It's a bean

211
00:09:51,696 --> 00:09:52,696
How about Nakayama?

212
00:09:52,696 --> 00:09:54,696
Eat spicy food

213
00:09:54,696 --> 00:09:55,696
Is it Nakayama?

214
00:09:55,696 --> 00:09:56,696
It's not spicy

215
00:09:56,696 --> 00:09:58,696
Is it Nakayama?

216
00:09:58,696 --> 00:10:00,696
Is it spicy?

217
00:10:00,696 --> 00:10:01,696
Is it spicy?

218
00:10:01,696 --> 00:10:03,696
Shrimp Chuu Pass

219
00:10:03,696 --> 00:10:06,696
Indian bean dessert is

220
00:10:06,696 --> 00:10:07,696
How about Nakayama?

221
00:10:07,696 --> 00:10:09,696
Eat spicy food

222
00:10:09,696 --> 00:10:13,696
Mr. Placard became Nakayama

223
00:10:13,696 --> 00:10:14,696
It's important to eat

224
00:10:14,696 --> 00:10:16,696
It's not spicy until now

225
00:10:16,696 --> 00:10:18,696
I want you to eat spicy food

226
00:10:18,696 --> 00:10:20,696
I want you to eat sweet food after that

227
00:10:20,696 --> 00:10:22,696
There are many things

228
00:10:22,696 --> 00:10:24,696
She is very generous

229
00:10:24,696 --> 00:10:26,696
I'm a big fan of it

230
00:10:26,696 --> 00:10:30,696
Which do you want to eat, sweet or
spicy?

231
00:10:30,696 --> 00:10:32,696
I want you to eat spicy food first and
then sweet food

232
00:10:32,696 --> 00:10:35,696
I want you to eat sweet food first and
then spicy food

233
00:10:35,696 --> 00:10:39,344
I want you to eat spicy food first and
then sweet food

234
00:10:39,344 --> 00:10:41,344
I got it

235
00:10:42,344 --> 00:10:47,344
So, they tasted the spicy snack
recommended by the store manager

236
00:10:52,344 --> 00:10:53,344
I'm not good at spicy food

237
00:10:53,344 --> 00:10:54,344
Ladies first

238
00:10:54,344 --> 00:10:55,344
Ladies first?

239
00:10:55,344 --> 00:11:02,202
So kind!

240
00:11:02,202 --> 00:11:05,202
Why did you say that?

241
00:11:05,202 --> 00:11:08,202
Because it's business

242
00:11:12,202 --> 00:11:14,202
Egi-chuu Pass

243
00:11:14,202 --> 00:11:16,202
What is the spicy Indian snack?

244
00:11:16,202 --> 00:11:18,202
Let's eat

245
00:11:19,202 --> 00:11:21,202
The smell is amazing

246
00:11:21,202 --> 00:11:23,202
It comes later

247
00:11:23,202 --> 00:11:25,202
It's spicy

248
00:11:25,202 --> 00:11:27,202
What's wrong?

249
00:11:27,202 --> 00:11:31,202
The pepper is here

250
00:11:31,202 --> 00:11:33,202
It's not coming out

251
00:11:33,202 --> 00:11:35,202
The pepper is working

252
00:11:35,202 --> 00:11:37,202
What's wrong?

253
00:11:37,202 --> 00:11:39,202
It's spicy

254
00:11:39,202 --> 00:11:41,202
It's good

255
00:11:41,202 --> 00:11:43,202
It's spicy

256
00:11:43,202 --> 00:11:45,202
How about you, Nakayama?

257
00:11:45,202 --> 00:11:47,202
It's good

258
00:11:51,202 --> 00:11:53,202
Where are you from?

259
00:11:53,202 --> 00:11:55,202
I'm from Tokyo

260
00:11:55,202 --> 00:11:57,202
It's spicy

261
00:11:57,202 --> 00:11:59,202
Egi-chuu Pass

262
00:11:59,202 --> 00:12:01,202
What is the spicy Indian snack?

263
00:12:01,202 --> 00:12:03,202
Nakayama?

264
00:12:03,202 --> 00:12:06,202
The store manager was Nakayama

265
00:12:06,202 --> 00:12:08,202
How about Nakayama?

266
00:12:08,202 --> 00:12:10,202
It's spicy

267
00:12:10,202 --> 00:12:14,272
Nakayama became a Kansai person

268
00:12:14,272 --> 00:12:20,072
We have the image that Indians love
spicy food

269
00:12:20,072 --> 00:12:22,432
Do Indians eat sweet food?

270
00:12:22,432 --> 00:12:24,432
It's very sweet if it's sweet

271
00:12:24,432 --> 00:12:27,432
Spicy food is very spicy and sweet food
is very sweet

272
00:12:27,432 --> 00:12:30,432
There is no Chinese food

273
00:12:30,432 --> 00:12:32,432
There is Chinese food

274
00:12:36,432 --> 00:12:39,432
There are many things, but I like sweet
food

275
00:12:39,432 --> 00:12:43,432
I will eat sweet food next time

276
00:12:45,008 --> 00:12:47,008
What is this?

277
00:12:47,008 --> 00:12:49,008
This is

278
00:12:49,008 --> 00:12:51,008
Sorry

279
00:12:51,008 --> 00:12:53,008
What is this?

280
00:12:53,008 --> 00:12:55,008
This is called

281
00:12:55,008 --> 00:12:57,008
Graja moon

282
00:12:57,008 --> 00:12:59,008
Graja moon

283
00:12:59,008 --> 00:13:01,008
Mix wheat flour and

284
00:13:01,008 --> 00:13:03,008
cheese

285
00:13:03,008 --> 00:13:05,008
and open

286
00:13:05,008 --> 00:13:07,008
and add sugar and juice

287
00:13:07,008 --> 00:13:09,008
Isn't this fruit?

288
00:13:09,008 --> 00:13:11,008
It's not fruit

289
00:13:11,008 --> 00:13:13,008
What is this?

290
00:13:13,008 --> 00:13:15,008
Donuts

291
00:13:15,008 --> 00:13:17,008
Donuts are made with sugar and juice

292
00:13:17,008 --> 00:13:19,008
It's so sweet

293
00:13:19,008 --> 00:13:30,032
After this, add Indian sweets to shrimp

294
00:13:30,032 --> 00:13:32,032
It's very sweet

295
00:13:33,032 --> 00:13:36,032
To try Indian sweets

296
00:13:37,032 --> 00:13:39,032
Don't open it too fast

297
00:13:41,032 --> 00:13:42,032
Be careful

298
00:13:42,032 --> 00:13:43,032
I'm scared

299
00:13:43,032 --> 00:13:44,032
I'm nervous

300
00:13:44,032 --> 00:13:46,032
It's open

301
00:13:48,032 --> 00:13:52,032
This is Indian sweets, GULAB JAMUN

302
00:13:52,032 --> 00:13:57,032
The ball-shaped sweet donuts are soaked
in syrup

303
00:13:57,032 --> 00:14:02,032
Shrimp Chou plus GULAB JAMUN

304
00:14:02,032 --> 00:14:08,720
Please smell it

305
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:10,720
What is the smell?

306
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:12,528
Please smell it

307
00:14:12,528 --> 00:14:14,528
It's a fruit

308
00:14:14,528 --> 00:14:16,528
Fruit?

309
00:14:16,528 --> 00:14:18,528
I don't know

310
00:14:18,528 --> 00:14:20,528
It's hard

311
00:14:20,528 --> 00:14:22,528
It's very sweet

312
00:14:22,528 --> 00:14:24,528
It's not just sugar

313
00:14:24,528 --> 00:14:26,528
I see

314
00:14:26,528 --> 00:14:28,528
It smells like sugar

315
00:14:28,528 --> 00:14:30,528
But there is something else

316
00:14:30,528 --> 00:14:32,528
What is it?

317
00:14:32,528 --> 00:14:34,528
It smells like a kitchen

318
00:14:34,528 --> 00:14:36,528
What?

319
00:14:36,528 --> 00:14:38,528
It smells like a kitchen

320
00:14:38,528 --> 00:14:40,528
It depends on the family

321
00:14:40,528 --> 00:14:42,528
It smells sweet

322
00:14:42,528 --> 00:14:44,528
Okay

323
00:14:44,528 --> 00:14:46,528
Please smell it

324
00:14:46,528 --> 00:14:48,528
It smells like bread

325
00:14:48,528 --> 00:14:50,528
Who?

326
00:14:50,528 --> 00:14:52,528
I know

327
00:14:52,528 --> 00:14:54,528
Did you smell it?

328
00:14:54,528 --> 00:14:56,528
It's like sugar

329
00:14:56,528 --> 00:14:58,528
But someone doesn't know

330
00:14:58,528 --> 00:15:00,528
I have smelled it

331
00:15:00,528 --> 00:15:02,528
Have you?

332
00:15:02,528 --> 00:15:04,528
Can you tell me?

333
00:15:04,528 --> 00:15:06,528
It smells like a good thing

334
00:15:06,528 --> 00:15:08,528
It's very good

335
00:15:08,528 --> 00:15:10,528
It's a good answer

336
00:15:10,528 --> 00:15:12,528
It's a good answer

337
00:15:12,528 --> 00:15:14,528
It smells like a good thing

338
00:15:14,528 --> 00:15:16,528
It's a good thing

339
00:15:16,528 --> 00:15:19,808
It's a good answer

340
00:15:19,808 --> 00:15:22,808
Hirota, what do you think?

341
00:15:22,808 --> 00:15:25,808
There are some people who don't know

342
00:15:25,808 --> 00:15:28,808
What do you mean?

343
00:15:28,808 --> 00:15:31,808
Flowers or something

344
00:15:31,808 --> 00:15:34,808
Good idea

345
00:15:34,808 --> 00:15:37,808
The meaning of Grav is rose

346
00:15:37,808 --> 00:15:40,808
Wow

347
00:15:40,808 --> 00:15:43,808
The answer came out before Kobayashi
answered

348
00:15:43,808 --> 00:15:46,808
Shrimp kiss plus Grav jam

349
00:15:46,808 --> 00:15:49,808
It's a good smell

350
00:15:49,808 --> 00:15:54,464
The comment went into the manager's pot

351
00:15:54,464 --> 00:15:58,464
When he tried the sweet sweet sweet

352
00:16:00,464 --> 00:16:01,464
Oh, it's sweet

353
00:16:01,464 --> 00:16:02,464
How about Hirota?

354
00:16:02,464 --> 00:16:03,464
It's sweet

355
00:16:03,464 --> 00:16:04,464
It's sweet

356
00:16:06,464 --> 00:16:07,464
It's sweet

357
00:16:07,464 --> 00:16:08,464
How is it?

358
00:16:10,464 --> 00:16:11,464
It's just right

359
00:16:13,464 --> 00:16:14,464
It's sweet

360
00:16:14,464 --> 00:16:17,464
I put 3 or 4 sugar in the tea

361
00:16:17,464 --> 00:16:18,464
Mayama?

362
00:16:18,464 --> 00:16:25,464
The manager recommended it, and the
sweet sweet is just right for Mayama

363
00:16:26,464 --> 00:16:29,464
And the famous thing in India is

364
00:16:29,464 --> 00:16:32,464
In India, there is a drink called Chai

365
00:16:32,464 --> 00:16:33,464
Yes, Chai

366
00:16:33,464 --> 00:16:36,464
I drink it 3 or 4 times a day

367
00:16:36,464 --> 00:16:37,464
Really?

368
00:16:37,464 --> 00:16:38,464
Do you know Chai?

369
00:16:38,464 --> 00:16:39,464
No

370
00:16:39,464 --> 00:16:40,464
I don't

371
00:16:40,464 --> 00:16:41,464
Kobayashi, you don't know?

372
00:16:41,464 --> 00:16:42,464
What do you think Chai is?

373
00:16:42,464 --> 00:16:43,464
Chai?

374
00:16:43,464 --> 00:16:44,464
What is it?

375
00:16:44,464 --> 00:16:45,464
Chai is

376
00:16:45,464 --> 00:16:46,464
What do you think?

377
00:16:46,464 --> 00:16:48,464
Chai is

378
00:16:48,464 --> 00:16:51,464
Chai is a flower

379
00:16:51,464 --> 00:16:52,464
A flower

380
00:16:54,464 --> 00:16:56,464
Who doesn't know Chai?

381
00:16:57,464 --> 00:16:58,464
Nakayama?

382
00:16:58,464 --> 00:17:00,464
I know it

383
00:17:01,464 --> 00:17:02,464
You know it?

384
00:17:03,464 --> 00:17:04,464
Milk?

385
00:17:04,464 --> 00:17:05,464
No

386
00:17:05,464 --> 00:17:06,464
Then it's milk

387
00:17:08,464 --> 00:17:09,464
No

388
00:17:09,464 --> 00:17:10,464
Milk tea

389
00:17:10,464 --> 00:17:11,464
Milk tea

390
00:17:12,464 --> 00:17:14,464
It's Indian milk tea

391
00:17:14,464 --> 00:17:16,464
Yes, it's called Chai

392
00:17:16,464 --> 00:17:21,464
Kobayashi and Nakayama learned one
thing, and the tasting time is over

393
00:17:21,464 --> 00:17:25,464
And MC Kobayashi will decide

394
00:17:27,464 --> 00:17:31,464
Are there any places where Indians
gather?

395
00:17:31,464 --> 00:17:33,464
Yes

396
00:17:33,464 --> 00:17:38,464
There is a community hall, so Indians
gather there

397
00:17:39,464 --> 00:17:40,464
Community hall?

398
00:17:40,464 --> 00:17:41,464
Yes

399
00:17:41,464 --> 00:17:42,464
Is that today?

400
00:17:42,464 --> 00:17:43,464
Yes

401
00:17:43,464 --> 00:17:45,464
Let's go

402
00:17:45,464 --> 00:17:48,464
If you have time, please go

403
00:17:48,464 --> 00:17:49,464
I want to go

404
00:17:49,464 --> 00:17:51,464
Let's go

405
00:17:51,464 --> 00:17:52,464
Let's go

406
00:17:52,464 --> 00:17:53,464
Thank you

407
00:17:54,464 --> 00:17:56,464
And before that

408
00:17:56,464 --> 00:18:01,728
Ebichu Game Quest

409
00:18:01,728 --> 00:18:06,728
The game project is in progress!

410
00:18:08,728 --> 00:18:15,728
The members of Ebichu have been chosen
to challenge various games for the game
project that was suddenly announced.

411
00:18:15,728 --> 00:18:23,008
Last time, we showed a great game
project with Jenga and it was a success!

412
00:18:23,008 --> 00:18:27,008
What is the quest this time?

413
00:18:39,168 --> 00:18:40,608
I'll open it.

414
00:18:40,608 --> 00:18:41,608
A letter.

415
00:18:41,608 --> 00:18:42,608
A letter.

416
00:18:42,608 --> 00:18:43,608
Let's read it.

417
00:18:43,608 --> 00:18:44,608
A letter has arrived.

418
00:18:44,608 --> 00:18:46,608
A letter has arrived.

419
00:18:46,608 --> 00:18:47,608
Who is it?

420
00:18:47,608 --> 00:18:49,608
Who could it be?

421
00:18:49,608 --> 00:18:53,608
Experience the games of the world and
aim for a level up.

422
00:18:53,608 --> 00:18:56,608
Today's game is a black beard game.

423
00:18:57,608 --> 00:18:58,608
However,

424
00:18:58,608 --> 00:18:59,608
What?

425
00:18:59,608 --> 00:19:01,608
The losing team will get a ____________.

426
00:19:01,608 --> 00:19:02,608
I see.

427
00:19:02,608 --> 00:19:03,608
Okay, let's get started.

428
00:19:03,608 --> 00:19:05,608
What is it this time?

429
00:19:05,608 --> 00:19:06,608
What?

430
00:19:06,608 --> 00:19:08,608
What is it this time?

431
00:19:08,608 --> 00:19:10,608
It's a beard dance.

432
00:19:12,448 --> 00:19:18,448
This time, Ebichu will challenge a black
beard dance.

433
00:19:18,448 --> 00:19:20,448
I'll do it.

434
00:19:20,448 --> 00:19:22,448
Let's do it here.

435
00:19:24,448 --> 00:19:26,448
But this is...

436
00:19:26,448 --> 00:19:28,448
I'm scared.

437
00:19:28,448 --> 00:19:30,448
I wonder if U-ma has it.

438
00:19:38,448 --> 00:19:40,448
Wait, isn't it too soon?

439
00:19:40,448 --> 00:19:42,448
No!

440
00:19:42,448 --> 00:19:46,080
I'm not a good dancer.

441
00:19:46,080 --> 00:19:48,580
einer!

442
00:19:51,580 --> 00:19:52,580
I did it!

443
00:19:55,080 --> 00:19:58,080
Liar!

444
00:19:59,080 --> 00:20:02,580
Hey, hey, hey, hey, JeLiE, yeah, yeah,
yeah.

445
00:20:02,580 --> 00:20:04,580
Thank you for watching!

446
00:20:05,312 --> 00:20:07,312
I'm scared

447
00:20:07,312 --> 00:20:09,312
Can you hurry up?

448
00:20:09,312 --> 00:20:11,312
I'm scared

449
00:20:19,312 --> 00:20:20,312
I'm scared

450
00:20:20,312 --> 00:20:22,312
I'm going to chase the person who hurt
me

451
00:20:23,312 --> 00:20:25,312
Eri-Chu Game Project

452
00:20:25,312 --> 00:20:28,312
The dangerous adventure continues

453
00:20:28,312 --> 00:20:32,312
Please look forward to the next episode

454
00:20:32,784 --> 00:20:36,784
Is there a place where Indians gather?

455
00:20:36,784 --> 00:20:40,784
There is a community hall, so Indians
gather there

456
00:20:40,784 --> 00:20:41,784
Wow!

457
00:20:41,784 --> 00:20:43,784
Let's go!

458
00:20:43,784 --> 00:20:45,784
Let's go!

459
00:20:45,784 --> 00:20:51,784
After saying goodbye to the generous
manager, they go to the community hall
where Indians gather

460
00:20:55,784 --> 00:20:57,784
Then

461
00:20:57,784 --> 00:21:01,784
Wow!

462
00:21:02,394 --> 00:21:04,394
What's going on?

463
00:21:04,394 --> 00:21:06,394
What's going on?

464
00:21:10,394 --> 00:21:12,394
Wait a minute!

465
00:21:12,394 --> 00:21:14,394
What's going on?

466
00:21:14,394 --> 00:21:16,394
There are so many people here!

467
00:21:16,394 --> 00:21:20,954
There are so many people here!

468
00:21:20,954 --> 00:21:22,954
Why are you dancing?

469
00:21:22,954 --> 00:21:24,954
Somehow he noticed

470
00:21:24,954 --> 00:21:28,954
Wait, wait, he's dancing in the middle

471
00:21:28,954 --> 00:21:30,954
What?

472
00:21:30,954 --> 00:21:32,954
That person is...

473
00:21:32,954 --> 00:21:34,954
What?

474
00:21:34,954 --> 00:21:36,954
I've never seen him before

475
00:21:36,954 --> 00:21:39,954
I've been waiting for you all

476
00:21:39,954 --> 00:21:40,954
What?

477
00:21:40,954 --> 00:21:46,954
Everyone, today you've all come to a
party for me

478
00:21:46,954 --> 00:21:48,954
Why?

479
00:21:48,954 --> 00:21:55,954
The vocalist of the indie band Hiya,
Kaiki Ogata

480
00:21:55,954 --> 00:22:02,954
He will continue to participate in the
location as a castas member

481
00:22:02,954 --> 00:22:04,954
Everyone, are you excited?

482
00:22:04,954 --> 00:22:06,954
Yes

483
00:22:06,954 --> 00:22:08,954
Are you excited?

484
00:22:08,954 --> 00:22:10,330
Yes

485
00:22:10,330 --> 00:22:12,330
Is that okay?

486
00:22:14,240 --> 00:22:16,240
How about it?

487
00:22:16,240 --> 00:22:18,240
How about it?

488
00:22:19,240 --> 00:22:25,240
The people who were excited with the big
atmosphere were the Indians living in
Nishikasai.

489
00:22:25,240 --> 00:22:29,240
So, first of all, this question.

490
00:22:29,240 --> 00:22:35,240
Are there any celebrities in India that
are popular in this country?

491
00:22:35,240 --> 00:22:37,240
I think there's only Sumo.

492
00:22:37,240 --> 00:22:39,240
Sumo?

493
00:22:39,240 --> 00:22:41,240
Sumo?

494
00:22:41,240 --> 00:22:43,240
Sumo, Sumo.

495
00:22:43,240 --> 00:22:45,240
Sumo.

496
00:22:45,240 --> 00:22:47,240
Yes, yes, yes.

497
00:22:47,240 --> 00:22:50,240
What did you say about Sumo?

498
00:22:50,240 --> 00:22:52,240
Sumo.

499
00:22:54,240 --> 00:22:58,240
By the way, are there any other
celebrities you like?

500
00:22:58,240 --> 00:23:01,240
8.6 seconds bazooka.

501
00:23:03,240 --> 00:23:05,240
Stop saying the same thing.

502
00:23:05,240 --> 00:23:07,240
Stop saying the same thing in front of
us.

503
00:23:07,240 --> 00:23:14,240
8.6 seconds bazooka is made by Kaiki and
Kobayashi.

504
00:23:15,240 --> 00:23:21,240
Kobayashi plus Kaiki Ogata plus 8.6
seconds bazooka is...

505
00:23:21,240 --> 00:23:23,240
You have to do it.

506
00:23:23,240 --> 00:23:25,240
I can't do it.

507
00:23:25,240 --> 00:23:27,240
I can't do it.

508
00:23:27,240 --> 00:23:29,240
I can't do it.

509
00:23:29,240 --> 00:23:31,240
I can't do it.

510
00:23:32,240 --> 00:23:34,240
Good.

511
00:23:34,240 --> 00:23:37,240
I taught you the dance earlier.

512
00:23:37,240 --> 00:23:40,240
Wait a minute, Mori-san.

513
00:23:40,240 --> 00:23:43,240
What is this?

514
00:23:43,240 --> 00:23:45,240
What is it?

515
00:23:45,240 --> 00:23:47,240
What is it?

516
00:23:47,240 --> 00:23:49,240
It's a new buzzword.

517
00:23:49,240 --> 00:23:51,240
It's a new buzzword.

518
00:23:51,240 --> 00:23:53,240
Maybe...

519
00:23:53,240 --> 00:23:55,240
Maybe...

520
00:23:55,240 --> 00:23:57,240
You don't know?

521
00:23:57,240 --> 00:23:59,240
8.6 seconds buzzword, you don't know?

522
00:23:59,240 --> 00:24:03,240
This is a comedian, right?

523
00:24:03,240 --> 00:24:05,240
Of course.

524
00:24:05,240 --> 00:24:07,240
You don't know?

525
00:24:07,240 --> 00:24:09,240
Do you want me to dig it up?

526
00:24:09,240 --> 00:24:11,240
You know, right?

527
00:24:11,240 --> 00:24:12,240
No.

528
00:24:12,240 --> 00:24:14,240
Then, please try it.

529
00:24:14,240 --> 00:24:16,240
Please dance.

530
00:24:16,240 --> 00:24:21,242
What?

531
00:24:21,882 --> 00:24:23,402
Do it quickly

532
00:24:23,802 --> 00:24:25,922
ruler of drunken своих

533
00:24:28,642 --> 00:24:30,682
to dance together

534
00:24:31,162 --> 00:24:33,442
Ah

535
00:24:33,642 --> 00:24:35,322
'll enter the Beast

536
00:24:35,402 --> 00:24:36,522
Wait Please

537
00:24:36,522 --> 00:24:36,570
Thank you for watching!

538
00:24:36,570 --> 00:24:40,570
Hey, what is the last gorilla?

539
00:24:40,570 --> 00:24:44,570
Yes, yes, I want to wait a little

540
00:24:44,570 --> 00:24:47,570
I don't know this person

541
00:24:47,570 --> 00:24:50,570
I don't know the last gorilla

542
00:24:50,570 --> 00:24:54,570
So, if you add Indians to the shrimp

543
00:24:54,570 --> 00:24:57,570
8.6 seconds bazooka

544
00:24:57,570 --> 00:25:04,570
Both the shrimp and the Indians loved
the 8.6 seconds bazooka

545
00:25:04,570 --> 00:25:06,570
It's a good opportunity

546
00:25:06,656 --> 00:25:09,656
I rarely have this opportunity

547
00:25:09,656 --> 00:25:18,330
I want to promote shrimp blood to
Indians

548
00:25:18,330 --> 00:25:23,330
Next time, Ebichu will have a PR battle
with an Indian.

549
00:25:23,330 --> 00:25:26,330
What will be the result of the heated
battle?

550
00:25:26,330 --> 00:25:30,330
Moreover, a mysterious fortune-teller
appears.

551
00:25:30,330 --> 00:25:32,330
Is it amazing?

552
00:25:32,330 --> 00:25:40,688
The shocking future of Ebichu members is
revealed.

553
00:25:40,688 --> 00:25:45,688
