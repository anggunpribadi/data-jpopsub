Appearance: Private Ebisu Junior High School Nagareboshi

Today's daily staff: Kaho Kobayashi

Contents: Let's add "various things" to the idol group Shiritsu Ebisu Chugaku! Such an experimental program that keeps on throwing.
The theme this time is "Ebichu + Indian". The daily MC is Kaho Kobayashi. However, there is no way Kobayashi can manage it properly, and the program opens with a runaway MC talk. Ebicshu and the shooting stars head to Nishikasai, the city where the largest number of Indians live in Japan. We interviewed a general store that sells Indian ingredients, and were very excited about the super sweet Indian sweets.
He also participated in an Indian rally. Ebichu reproduces the much-talked-about 8.6-second bazooka skit that Indians also like. A chaotic Indian party begins. And the shrimp middle game project is steadily progressing. Members will struggle in the game room this week too!
