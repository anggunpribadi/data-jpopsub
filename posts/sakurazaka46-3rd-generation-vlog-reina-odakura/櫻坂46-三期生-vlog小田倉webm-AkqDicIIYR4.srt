00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
I'm Reina Odakura, a third-year high
school student from Tokyo.

2
00:00:11,322 --> 00:00:19,322
I played the violin a little bit when I
was in junior high school, so I will
play the violin today.

3
00:00:35,834 --> 00:00:37,834
Thank you very much.

4
00:00:37,834 --> 00:00:45,834
Today, I came to Gunma Observatory,
which has the largest telescope in
Kanto.

5
00:00:45,834 --> 00:00:55,834
Today, I came to the two corals, which
are my charming points, to see the sky.

6
00:00:55,834 --> 00:01:02,368
Today, I came to the two corals, which
are my charming points, to see the sky.

7
00:01:03,368 --> 00:01:08,368
I will also see the whole of Coine's
Procyon and the whole of Coine's.

8
00:01:09,368 --> 00:01:19,368
The reason I fell in love with stars is
that when I was in elementary school, I
heard from my teacher that there are
much bigger and brighter stars than the
sun.

9
00:01:20,368 --> 00:01:25,368
I was interested in how small I was.

10
00:01:26,368 --> 00:01:28,368
I'm going to see the stars now.

11
00:01:28,368 --> 00:01:32,384
Etergius is a red star, but it's a
little bit brighter than the sun.

12
00:01:33,384 --> 00:01:35,384
I can see the red star clearly.

13
00:01:36,384 --> 00:01:37,384
I'm impressed.

14
00:01:37,384 --> 00:01:42,384
I can see the small stars, too.

15
00:01:42,384 --> 00:01:43,384
I'm impressed.

16
00:01:43,384 --> 00:01:50,384
Next, I'm looking forward to seeing how
it looks like with a bigger telescope.

17
00:01:50,384 --> 00:01:51,384
Wow!

18
00:01:53,384 --> 00:01:55,384
I can see the red star.

19
00:01:55,384 --> 00:01:56,384
It's a planet.

20
00:01:56,384 --> 00:01:57,384
It's a planet.

21
00:01:57,384 --> 00:01:58,384
It's a planet.

22
00:01:58,384 --> 00:02:01,856
I can see the red star clearly.

23
00:02:02,856 --> 00:02:06,856
It's about 9 to 10 times the size of the
Earth.

24
00:02:06,856 --> 00:02:08,856
It's huge.

25
00:02:09,856 --> 00:02:10,856
It's amazing.

26
00:02:10,856 --> 00:02:11,856
It's really amazing.

27
00:02:11,856 --> 00:02:17,264
It's the first time I've seen it with my
own eyes.

28
00:02:18,264 --> 00:02:21,264
Next, let's look at Jupiter.

29
00:02:21,264 --> 00:02:24,264
I'll move the telescope toward Jupiter.

30
00:02:28,264 --> 00:02:31,264
Jupiter is a little bigger than Saturn.

31
00:02:31,264 --> 00:02:35,264
It's about 11 times bigger than Earth.

32
00:02:35,264 --> 00:02:40,264
If you go from Earth to the speed of
light, it's about half of Saturn.

33
00:02:40,264 --> 00:02:44,592
It's about 40 minutes.

34
00:02:45,592 --> 00:02:50,592
I used this telescope to see the Jupiter
and Saturn.

35
00:02:51,592 --> 00:02:55,592
The starry sky was beautiful, and I
could see Saturn very well.

36
00:02:56,592 --> 00:02:59,592
I could even see the rings.

37
00:03:00,592 --> 00:03:02,592
I was so impressed. I'm glad I came.

38
00:03:03,592 --> 00:03:06,592
I'm so impressed that I could see it.

39
00:03:07,592 --> 00:03:09,592
I'm in Koenuza. I saw Koenuza.

40
00:03:10,592 --> 00:03:12,592
It's around here.

41
00:03:12,592 --> 00:03:16,592
I've been waiting for the sun to rise,
and I could see it.

42
00:03:16,592 --> 00:03:18,528
I'm glad I came.

43
00:03:19,528 --> 00:03:23,528
It's the same shape as my bag.

44
00:03:24,528 --> 00:03:26,528
It's very similar.

45
00:03:26,528 --> 00:03:32,528
The alpha protein of COINUZA is one-
dimensional.

46
00:03:32,528 --> 00:03:51,381
I will do my best to shine like that
star.
