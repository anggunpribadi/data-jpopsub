1
00:00:00,570 --> 00:00:05,570
I'm going to challenge the 10 spiciest
ones

2
00:00:05,570 --> 00:00:09,570
I'm here to eat curry

3
00:00:09,570 --> 00:00:11,570
I'm going to challenge the 10 spiciest
ones

4
00:00:11,570 --> 00:00:12,570
Are you going to eat them?

5
00:00:12,570 --> 00:00:14,570
I'm not sure if I can eat spicy food

6
00:00:14,570 --> 00:00:16,570
I think you can eat normal food

7
00:00:16,570 --> 00:00:19,570
I'm not good at eating spicy food

8
00:00:19,570 --> 00:00:21,570
I'm going to challenge it

9
00:00:21,570 --> 00:00:22,570
I'm scared

10
00:00:22,570 --> 00:00:27,418
Please subscribe!

11
00:00:27,418 --> 00:00:29,418
Itadakimasu

12
00:00:29,418 --> 00:00:32,418
I've never tried Hachi before

13
00:00:32,418 --> 00:00:37,418
Hachi is in the middle of recording

14
00:00:37,418 --> 00:00:43,418
There is a place near the recording
place

15
00:00:43,418 --> 00:00:47,418
I've been there twice

16
00:00:47,418 --> 00:00:49,418
I've been eating Hachi Kara at that time

17
00:00:49,418 --> 00:00:51,418
It looks delicious

18
00:00:51,418 --> 00:00:53,418
What did you put on top?

19
00:00:53,418 --> 00:00:55,418
I put cheese

20
00:00:55,418 --> 00:00:57,418
I don't know where the cheese is

21
00:00:57,418 --> 00:00:59,418
It's already melted

22
00:00:59,418 --> 00:01:01,418
It smells good

23
00:01:01,418 --> 00:01:03,418
Sausage and spinach

24
00:01:03,418 --> 00:01:05,418
You are a senior

25
00:01:05,418 --> 00:01:09,418
I didn't know that

26
00:01:09,418 --> 00:01:11,418
I didn't know that there was this

27
00:01:11,418 --> 00:01:13,418
I didn't know

28
00:01:13,418 --> 00:01:15,418
Itadakimasu

29
00:01:15,418 --> 00:01:17,418
The color is different

30
00:01:17,418 --> 00:01:19,418
The color is different

31
00:01:19,418 --> 00:01:21,418
The color is different

32
00:01:21,418 --> 00:01:23,418
I want to taste it

33
00:01:23,418 --> 00:01:25,418
It's delicious

34
00:01:25,418 --> 00:01:27,418
The color of curry is different

35
00:01:27,418 --> 00:01:29,418
I don't want to show it

36
00:01:29,418 --> 00:01:31,418
Itadakimasu

37
00:01:31,418 --> 00:01:33,418
I'll start with Roo

38
00:01:33,418 --> 00:01:35,418
Itadakimasu

39
00:01:39,856 --> 00:01:41,856
It's spicy as usual!

40
00:01:42,856 --> 00:01:44,856
It's not 10 spicy!

41
00:01:44,856 --> 00:01:45,856
What?

42
00:01:45,856 --> 00:01:46,856
Why?

43
00:01:46,856 --> 00:01:47,856
What?

44
00:01:47,856 --> 00:01:48,856
You're kidding!

45
00:01:48,856 --> 00:01:49,856
It's gonna be spicy later.

46
00:01:49,856 --> 00:01:51,856
It's gonna be spicy later.

47
00:01:51,856 --> 00:01:52,856
It's normal.

48
00:01:52,856 --> 00:01:54,856
It's 10 spicy.

49
00:01:56,856 --> 00:01:59,856
Is it more spicy if we eat it in a
restaurant?

50
00:01:59,856 --> 00:02:01,856
It's hot.

51
00:02:01,856 --> 00:02:03,856
It's easy to get hot.

52
00:02:04,856 --> 00:02:05,856
Can you eat it?

53
00:02:05,856 --> 00:02:06,856
I can't.

54
00:02:06,856 --> 00:02:07,856
It's delicious.

55
00:02:07,856 --> 00:02:09,856
When I eat it, I feel like I'm being
attacked.

56
00:02:12,856 --> 00:02:13,856
You're kidding.

57
00:02:13,856 --> 00:02:15,856
Can you eat it?

58
00:02:15,856 --> 00:02:18,856
To be continued.

59
00:02:19,666 --> 00:02:22,326
wait,

60
00:02:32,706 --> 00:02:35,066
This is not a joke.

61
00:02:35,066 --> 00:02:37,066
This is extremely spicy.

62
00:02:38,552 --> 00:02:42,552
I put spinach in it, so it became mild.

63
00:02:42,552 --> 00:02:44,552
It's spicy.

64
00:02:44,552 --> 00:02:46,552
It's spicy.

65
00:02:46,552 --> 00:02:48,552
It's spicy.

66
00:02:50,552 --> 00:02:52,552
It's spicy.

67
00:02:52,552 --> 00:02:54,552
I'm sorry.

68
00:02:55,354 --> 00:02:59,354
This is a little sweet.

69
00:02:59,354 --> 00:03:03,354
It's a little spicy.

70
00:03:03,354 --> 00:03:05,354
Isn't it great?

71
00:03:05,354 --> 00:03:07,354
It's delicious.

72
00:03:07,354 --> 00:03:09,354
Is it okay?

73
00:03:09,354 --> 00:03:11,354
It's delicious.

74
00:03:11,354 --> 00:03:13,354
It's 10 spicy.

75
00:03:13,354 --> 00:03:15,354
It was written on the receipt.

76
00:03:15,354 --> 00:03:17,354
I was surprised.

77
00:03:17,354 --> 00:03:19,354
I was practicing.

78
00:03:19,354 --> 00:03:21,354
I was surprised.

79
00:03:21,354 --> 00:03:23,354
I thought it was spicy.

80
00:03:23,354 --> 00:03:25,354
I think it's sweet.

81
00:03:25,354 --> 00:03:27,354
I think it's like this.

82
00:03:27,354 --> 00:03:29,354
It's cheese.

83
00:03:29,354 --> 00:03:31,354
Thank you for watching.

84
00:03:33,776 --> 00:03:35,776
I think it's getting spicy.

85
00:03:35,776 --> 00:03:37,776
I think it's getting hot.

86
00:03:37,776 --> 00:03:39,776
It's getting spicy.

87
00:03:39,776 --> 00:03:41,776
Oh, is it?

88
00:03:41,776 --> 00:03:43,776
It's the opposite.

89
00:03:43,776 --> 00:03:45,776
This is spicy.

90
00:03:45,776 --> 00:03:47,776
Let's warm it up.

91
00:03:47,776 --> 00:03:49,776
What?

92
00:03:49,776 --> 00:03:51,776
Do you want to try?

93
00:03:51,776 --> 00:03:53,776
It's hot.

94
00:03:53,776 --> 00:03:55,776
It's hot.

95
00:03:55,776 --> 00:03:57,776
It's hot because it's freshly made.

96
00:03:57,776 --> 00:03:59,776
It's different.

97
00:03:59,776 --> 00:04:01,776
It's getting spicy after I ate this.

98
00:04:01,776 --> 00:04:03,776
It's hot.

99
00:04:03,776 --> 00:04:05,776
It's getting spicy.

100
00:04:07,776 --> 00:04:09,776
It's different after I ate this.

101
00:04:11,776 --> 00:04:13,776
It's like this.

102
00:04:13,776 --> 00:04:15,776
It's getting spicy.

103
00:04:15,776 --> 00:04:17,776
It's getting spicy.

104
00:04:17,776 --> 00:04:19,776
Is the spiciness of the spice okay?

105
00:04:19,776 --> 00:04:21,776
The spiciness of ramen is okay.

106
00:04:21,776 --> 00:04:23,776
I see.

107
00:04:23,776 --> 00:04:25,776
I've eaten Mocotan before.

108
00:04:25,776 --> 00:04:27,776
I can't remember.

109
00:04:27,776 --> 00:04:29,776
It's still spicy.

110
00:04:29,776 --> 00:04:31,776
It's getting spicy after I ate this.

111
00:04:31,776 --> 00:04:33,776
Really?

112
00:04:33,776 --> 00:04:35,776
Is it a prank?

113
00:04:35,776 --> 00:04:37,776
It's actually spicy.

114
00:04:37,776 --> 00:04:39,776
I can't believe I ate curry.

115
00:04:39,776 --> 00:04:41,776
I can't believe I ate curry.

116
00:04:43,776 --> 00:04:45,776
It's a mystery.

117
00:04:45,776 --> 00:04:47,776
If you know any curry restaurants,

118
00:04:47,776 --> 00:04:49,776
If you know any curry restaurants,

119
00:04:49,776 --> 00:04:51,776
please let me know.

120
00:04:51,776 --> 00:04:53,776
Please let me know.

121
00:04:53,776 --> 00:04:55,776
If you know any curry restaurants,

122
00:04:55,776 --> 00:04:57,776
please let me know.

123
00:04:57,776 --> 00:04:59,776
I want to challenge it.

124
00:05:02,088 --> 00:05:03,088
It looks thick.

125
00:05:04,088 --> 00:05:07,088
It's very hot.

126
00:05:08,088 --> 00:05:12,088
It's been a while since I ate curry.
It's very delicious.

127
00:05:13,088 --> 00:05:14,088
It's a meal time.

128
00:05:15,088 --> 00:05:16,088
It's hot.

129
00:05:17,088 --> 00:05:19,088
Is it coming later?

130
00:05:20,088 --> 00:05:21,088
No, it's not.

131
00:05:21,088 --> 00:05:23,088
It's coming. I thought I ate it.

132
00:05:25,088 --> 00:05:27,088
It's hot.

133
00:05:28,088 --> 00:05:29,088
Did it explode?

134
00:05:29,088 --> 00:05:31,088
It's too hot.

135
00:05:32,088 --> 00:05:33,088
The sausage is broken.

136
00:05:34,088 --> 00:05:35,088
The sausage is gone.

137
00:05:38,088 --> 00:05:39,088
Where did it go?

138
00:05:40,088 --> 00:05:41,088
That's right.

139
00:05:42,088 --> 00:05:44,088
Is it okay?

140
00:05:45,088 --> 00:05:46,088
It's hot.

141
00:05:47,088 --> 00:05:48,088
It's coming.

142
00:05:49,088 --> 00:05:50,088
It's coming.

143
00:05:50,088 --> 00:05:51,088
I'm getting nervous.

144
00:05:52,088 --> 00:05:53,088
I want to challenge it.

145
00:05:53,088 --> 00:05:55,088
It's hot.

146
00:05:58,650 --> 00:06:00,650
Is it hot?

147
00:06:00,650 --> 00:06:01,650
Yes!

148
00:06:01,650 --> 00:06:03,650
It's hot and spicy!

149
00:06:03,650 --> 00:06:05,650
Is the temperature important?

150
00:06:05,650 --> 00:06:06,650
Yes.

151
00:06:06,650 --> 00:06:08,650
Are you okay?

152
00:06:08,650 --> 00:06:10,650
What?

153
00:06:10,650 --> 00:06:12,650
It's amazing.

154
00:06:12,650 --> 00:06:13,650
It's hot!

155
00:06:13,650 --> 00:06:15,650
Is it different from hot?

156
00:06:15,650 --> 00:06:17,650
Do you want to try it?

157
00:06:17,650 --> 00:06:18,650
No, I'm fine.

158
00:06:18,650 --> 00:06:21,650
I drank all the tea here.

159
00:06:21,650 --> 00:06:24,650
I'll try the Japanese tea.

160
00:06:24,650 --> 00:06:28,650
It's very hot.

161
00:06:29,594 --> 00:06:31,648
but the fact is that blaze mortal
japanese dub will be still on youtube

162
00:06:31,648 --> 00:06:33,648
I can't eat this!

163
00:06:33,648 --> 00:06:35,648
I'm so sorry.

164
00:06:35,648 --> 00:06:37,648
I can't eat this.

165
00:06:37,648 --> 00:06:39,648
I can't eat this.

166
00:06:41,648 --> 00:06:43,648
I can't eat spicy food.

167
00:06:43,648 --> 00:06:45,648
It's spicy.

168
00:06:45,648 --> 00:06:47,648
I can't eat this.

169
00:06:47,648 --> 00:06:49,648
Thank you.

170
00:06:49,648 --> 00:06:51,648
Is it so different?

171
00:06:51,648 --> 00:06:53,648
You can eat this with your normal face.

172
00:06:55,648 --> 00:06:57,648
I'm fine.

173
00:06:57,648 --> 00:07:01,648
I can't eat this.

174
00:07:02,330 --> 00:07:04,070
Next week review

175
00:07:04,070 --> 00:07:06,070
What are you doing?

176
00:07:07,904 --> 00:07:09,904
It's spicy, isn't it?

177
00:07:09,904 --> 00:07:10,904
What is this?

178
00:07:10,904 --> 00:07:12,904
It's normal

179
00:07:12,904 --> 00:07:15,904
It's 10 times spicier than I thought

180
00:07:15,904 --> 00:07:18,904
It's getting better, but it's still
spicy

181
00:07:20,904 --> 00:07:22,904
But it's still spicy

182
00:07:22,904 --> 00:07:23,904
That's right

183
00:07:23,904 --> 00:07:25,904
It's still spicy

184
00:07:26,904 --> 00:07:27,904
It's hot

185
00:07:27,904 --> 00:07:28,904
It's hot

186
00:07:28,904 --> 00:07:30,904
It's not because of the hair

187
00:07:31,904 --> 00:07:32,904
It's amazing

188
00:07:32,904 --> 00:07:34,904
If you keep eating it, your mouth will
be burning

189
00:07:34,904 --> 00:07:36,904
It's amazing, isn't it?

190
00:07:36,904 --> 00:07:39,904
I haven't eaten rice at all

191
00:07:39,904 --> 00:07:40,904
It's amazing

192
00:07:40,904 --> 00:07:43,904
I'm trying not to get carbohydrates

193
00:07:43,904 --> 00:07:46,904
I can eat that spicy food

194
00:07:46,904 --> 00:07:49,904
You are strong in spicy food

195
00:07:49,904 --> 00:07:50,904
It's hot

196
00:07:50,904 --> 00:07:51,904
It's hot

197
00:07:51,904 --> 00:07:52,904
It's hot

198
00:07:52,904 --> 00:07:53,040
Please subscribe to my channel!

199
00:07:54,040 --> 00:07:55,040
It's hot!

200
00:07:56,040 --> 00:07:57,040
It's hot!

201
00:07:57,040 --> 00:07:58,040
I can't eat it

202
00:07:59,040 --> 00:08:01,040
I'm not sure if it's hot or not

203
00:08:03,040 --> 00:08:04,040
It's hot

204
00:08:06,040 --> 00:08:07,040
Do you want to eat it?

205
00:08:07,040 --> 00:08:08,040
It's hot

206
00:08:08,040 --> 00:08:09,040
Can I have it?

207
00:08:09,040 --> 00:08:10,040
How is it?

208
00:08:10,040 --> 00:08:11,040
Can I?

209
00:08:11,040 --> 00:08:12,040
It's good

210
00:08:12,040 --> 00:08:13,040
Really?

211
00:08:13,040 --> 00:08:14,040
It's tender

212
00:08:14,040 --> 00:08:15,040
Thank you

213
00:08:16,040 --> 00:08:17,040
I can't eat it because it's hot

214
00:08:17,040 --> 00:08:18,040
I know

215
00:08:18,040 --> 00:08:20,040
It's hot!

216
00:08:20,040 --> 00:08:21,872
Please subscribe!

217
00:08:21,872 --> 00:08:25,912
I can't remember, but last year's
Ikebukuro festival was really spicy

218
00:08:25,912 --> 00:08:27,912
So you can't swallow spicy food?

219
00:08:27,912 --> 00:08:29,912
That's right

220
00:08:29,912 --> 00:08:31,912
This is hell

221
00:08:31,912 --> 00:08:33,912
It's spicy

222
00:08:33,912 --> 00:08:35,912
We finished eating

223
00:08:35,912 --> 00:08:37,912
Thank you for the meal

224
00:08:37,912 --> 00:08:39,912
I'm going to finish eating all of this

225
00:08:39,912 --> 00:08:41,912
You're going to eat it all?

226
00:08:41,912 --> 00:08:43,912
I'm going to eat the sausage as well

227
00:08:45,912 --> 00:08:47,912
This comes later

228
00:08:47,912 --> 00:08:52,912
But when it's spicy, it gets spicier if
you eat it with water

229
00:08:52,912 --> 00:08:54,912
Oh, I see

230
00:08:54,912 --> 00:08:56,912
Do you know?

231
00:08:56,912 --> 00:08:58,912
No, I don't know

232
00:08:58,912 --> 00:09:00,912
I don't know

233
00:09:00,912 --> 00:09:02,912
It's spicy

234
00:09:02,912 --> 00:09:04,912
Is it?

235
00:09:04,912 --> 00:09:06,912
It's spicy

236
00:09:06,912 --> 00:09:08,912
I feel the spiciness

237
00:09:08,912 --> 00:09:10,912
Oh

238
00:09:10,912 --> 00:09:12,912
Is it spicier than the one you ate last
time?

239
00:09:12,912 --> 00:09:14,912
I don't know about the one I ate last
time

240
00:09:14,912 --> 00:09:18,912
But I can eat it from the beginning

241
00:09:18,912 --> 00:09:21,912
I went there alone

242
00:09:21,912 --> 00:09:23,912
I didn't have time to talk

243
00:09:23,912 --> 00:09:25,912
I ate it all at once

244
00:09:25,912 --> 00:09:28,912
So I didn't feel the spiciness

245
00:09:28,912 --> 00:09:30,912
But now, it's spicy

246
00:09:30,912 --> 00:09:32,912
Riko, you ate it all by yourself?

247
00:09:32,912 --> 00:09:34,912
Yes, I did

248
00:09:34,912 --> 00:09:38,912
I can't eat it because it's spicy

249
00:09:38,912 --> 00:09:41,912
You can't eat it all by yourself?

250
00:09:41,912 --> 00:09:43,912
I'm glad

251
00:09:43,912 --> 00:09:45,912
You ate it silently

252
00:09:45,912 --> 00:09:49,912
I always ask you to make it 8

253
00:09:49,912 --> 00:09:51,912
Is it really 8?

254
00:09:51,912 --> 00:09:53,912
Please check

255
00:09:53,912 --> 00:09:55,912
It's okay

256
00:09:55,912 --> 00:09:57,912
I can't eat it

257
00:09:57,912 --> 00:09:59,912
Oh, it's almost done

258
00:09:59,912 --> 00:10:01,912
It's almost done

259
00:10:01,912 --> 00:10:03,912
It's spicy

260
00:10:03,912 --> 00:10:05,912
It's spicy enough

261
00:10:05,912 --> 00:10:07,912
It's spicy

262
00:10:07,912 --> 00:10:09,912
What's wrong, Riko?

263
00:10:09,912 --> 00:10:11,912
It's spicy

264
00:10:11,912 --> 00:10:13,912
Riko, you're sweating

265
00:10:17,136 --> 00:10:18,352
Bra intersection

266
00:10:18,352 --> 00:10:21,352
It's hot.

267
00:10:21,352 --> 00:10:25,352
She can't stop laughing.

268
00:10:25,352 --> 00:10:27,352
Is it hot?

269
00:10:27,352 --> 00:10:30,352
It's hot and spicy.

270
00:10:30,352 --> 00:10:33,352
I can't stop laughing.

271
00:10:34,352 --> 00:10:36,352
I can't stop laughing because it's
spicy.

272
00:10:36,352 --> 00:10:38,352
You shouldn't drink water.

273
00:10:38,352 --> 00:10:40,352
Really?

274
00:10:40,352 --> 00:10:43,352
If you drink water, it will be more
spicy.

275
00:10:43,352 --> 00:10:45,352
So, don't drink water and keep doing
your best.

276
00:10:45,352 --> 00:10:47,352
How spicy is it?

277
00:10:47,352 --> 00:10:48,352
Zero?

278
00:10:48,352 --> 00:10:50,352
It's not spicy at all.

279
00:10:50,352 --> 00:10:52,352
It's relatively spicy.

280
00:10:52,352 --> 00:10:54,352
You shouldn't drink water.

281
00:10:54,352 --> 00:10:56,352
She keeps drinking water.

282
00:10:56,352 --> 00:10:59,352
I'm getting stronger because I took a
break.

283
00:10:59,352 --> 00:11:01,352
I'm getting spicy because I ate a lot.

284
00:11:01,352 --> 00:11:02,352
I'm getting hungry.

285
00:11:02,352 --> 00:11:04,352
I'll give you one more.

286
00:11:05,352 --> 00:11:07,352
Are you serious?

287
00:11:07,352 --> 00:11:08,352
I can eat it.

288
00:11:08,352 --> 00:11:09,352
You're kind.

289
00:11:09,352 --> 00:11:11,352
I did it just now.

290
00:11:11,352 --> 00:11:13,352
It's hot.

291
00:11:13,352 --> 00:11:15,352
You started laughing.

292
00:11:15,352 --> 00:11:18,352
I can't stop laughing.

293
00:11:18,352 --> 00:11:21,352
I can't stop laughing.

294
00:11:23,668 --> 00:11:26,668
Is there a theory that you can cool down
spicy food?

295
00:11:26,668 --> 00:11:28,668
I can't cool it down.

296
00:11:29,668 --> 00:11:32,668
I think there are many hot foods.

297
00:11:32,668 --> 00:11:34,668
I think so.

298
00:11:34,668 --> 00:11:35,668
I think so.

299
00:11:35,668 --> 00:11:38,668
Do you feel hot when you eat spicy food?

300
00:11:38,668 --> 00:11:40,668
Do you feel hot when you eat spicy food?

301
00:11:40,668 --> 00:11:42,668
Wait a minute.

302
00:11:42,668 --> 00:11:44,668
Do you feel hot when you eat hot food?

303
00:11:44,668 --> 00:11:50,668
I think it's hot when I eat spicy food.

304
00:11:50,668 --> 00:11:52,668
I think so.

305
00:11:52,668 --> 00:11:54,668
I think so.

306
00:11:54,668 --> 00:11:56,668
I think so.

307
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:01,000
My stomach is burning.

308
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:03,000
You are amazing.

309
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:05,000
I ate it.

310
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:07,000
This is amazing.

311
00:12:08,448 --> 00:12:10,448
It's not painful.

312
00:12:10,448 --> 00:12:12,448
It's hot.

313
00:12:12,448 --> 00:12:14,448
It's hot.

314
00:12:14,448 --> 00:12:16,448
Isn't it hot?

315
00:12:16,448 --> 00:12:18,448
I'm eating it.

316
00:12:18,448 --> 00:12:20,448
It's hot and spicy.

317
00:12:20,448 --> 00:12:24,448
Curry which I haven't eaten for a long
time was delicious.

318
00:12:24,448 --> 00:12:26,448
Don't you eat curry often?

319
00:12:26,448 --> 00:12:28,448
I don't eat curry often.

320
00:12:28,448 --> 00:12:30,448
I didn't like curry much.

321
00:12:30,448 --> 00:12:34,448
I noticed the deliciousness of curry
recently.

322
00:12:34,448 --> 00:12:38,448
It was delicious because I ate curry
which I haven't eaten for a long time.

323
00:12:38,448 --> 00:12:40,448
It means that this curry is the most
delicious.

324
00:12:40,448 --> 00:12:42,448
That's what it means.

325
00:12:44,152 --> 00:12:45,152
It's spicy.

326
00:12:45,152 --> 00:12:46,152
It's hot.

327
00:12:46,152 --> 00:12:47,152
It's hot.

328
00:12:47,152 --> 00:12:48,152
It's hot.

329
00:12:54,152 --> 00:12:55,152
I finished eating.

330
00:12:55,152 --> 00:12:56,152
I finished eating.

331
00:12:57,832 --> 00:12:58,832
I will eat the rest later.

332
00:12:59,832 --> 00:13:01,832
Chanyu, you should eat something.

333
00:13:02,832 --> 00:13:03,832
I'm sorry.

334
00:13:03,832 --> 00:13:04,832
It was delicious.

335
00:13:05,832 --> 00:13:06,832
Thank you for the meal.

336
00:13:07,832 --> 00:13:08,832
It was delicious and spicy.

337
00:13:08,832 --> 00:13:11,832
I was fine at first, but it was spicy.

338
00:13:11,832 --> 00:13:12,832
I was fine.

339
00:13:12,832 --> 00:13:13,832
I was sweating.

340
00:13:13,832 --> 00:13:15,832
It was hot.

341
00:13:15,832 --> 00:13:16,832
It was delicious.

342
00:13:16,832 --> 00:13:18,832
I'm glad that you followed me.

343
00:13:20,832 --> 00:13:22,832
I will make a series.

344
00:13:22,832 --> 00:13:23,832
What should I name it?

345
00:13:23,832 --> 00:13:25,832
I will name it...

346
00:13:25,832 --> 00:13:26,832
Don't you want to name it?

347
00:13:27,832 --> 00:13:30,832
I'm not a person who can eat spicy food.

348
00:13:30,832 --> 00:13:31,832
I don't like spicy food.

349
00:13:31,832 --> 00:13:35,832
This is a video of Riko Nakayama eating
spicy food.

350
00:13:36,832 --> 00:13:37,832
Bye bye.

351
00:13:37,832 --> 00:13:40,832
This is a video of Riko Nakayama eating
spicy food.

352
00:13:40,832 --> 00:13:41,832
That's all.

353
00:13:41,832 --> 00:13:44,832
Thank you for watching.

354
00:13:45,832 --> 00:13:46,832
Thank you for watching.

355
00:13:47,832 --> 00:13:48,832
Bye bye.

356
00:13:48,832 --> 00:13:51,728
Thank you for watching.

357
00:13:52,728 --> 00:13:58,728
Next time, we will try to eat it with a
spoon.

358
00:13:58,728 --> 00:14:01,728
Wow, can you eat it like this?

359
00:14:01,728 --> 00:14:02,728
What's going on?

360
00:14:02,728 --> 00:14:04,728
It's scary.

361
00:14:04,728 --> 00:14:06,728
Can you eat it with a spoon?

362
00:14:06,728 --> 00:14:07,728
What?

363
00:14:07,728 --> 00:14:11,728
Next time, we will try to eat it with a
spoon.
