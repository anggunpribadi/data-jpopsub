1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
The End

2
00:00:02,010 --> 00:00:05,510
123 days before the train departs

3
00:00:06,670 --> 00:00:09,510
It's 123 days before the train departs.

4
00:00:12,930 --> 00:00:15,010
Thank you for your hard work.

5
00:00:17,630 --> 00:00:19,010
Thank you.

6
00:00:19,010 --> 00:00:21,274
Thank you.

7
00:00:21,274 --> 00:00:26,274
The three of them met for the first time
at the audition camp for the new members

8
00:00:28,274 --> 00:00:32,274
The final episode is three days and four
nights that they ran through to become
shrimp

9
00:00:32,274 --> 00:00:36,274
And the road they continued to struggle
for their fan meeting

10
00:00:36,274 --> 00:00:51,274
The final episode is coming soon!

11
00:00:52,418 --> 00:00:54,038
It's her first day at the camp.

12
00:00:55,038 --> 00:00:57,038
I'm really looking forward to it.

13
00:00:57,038 --> 00:01:00,498
I definitely want to join Ebichu.

14
00:01:01,958 --> 00:01:05,798
Yuno has always been passionate about
Ebichu.

15
00:01:08,078 --> 00:01:11,298
I'm looking forward to tomorrow.

16
00:01:11,298 --> 00:01:13,798
I'm looking forward to the dance lesson
tomorrow.

17
00:01:13,798 --> 00:01:19,344
I'm looking forward to being attacked by
the teacher.

18
00:01:19,344 --> 00:01:22,844
They were enjoying the training camp.

19
00:01:24,144 --> 00:01:26,344
You can put one hand down.

20
00:01:26,344 --> 00:01:30,844
If you can go further than the other,
please reach out your hand.

21
00:01:40,344 --> 00:01:44,344
I worked hard for this training camp and
stretched.

22
00:01:44,344 --> 00:01:48,344
I think I've improved a lot.

23
00:01:49,216 --> 00:01:50,596
Furthermore...

24
00:01:59,802 --> 00:02:06,802
I didn't make a loud voice because I
couldn't make it anymore, but I was told
that I couldn't hear it.

25
00:02:06,802 --> 00:02:14,304
Now, I'm beating up my seniors as the
most mischievous kid in the world.

26
00:02:14,304 --> 00:02:17,304
She has been struggling in the training
camp.

27
00:02:18,304 --> 00:02:20,304
I don't know what to do.

28
00:02:21,304 --> 00:02:26,304
I'm not good at singing and dancing.

29
00:02:26,304 --> 00:02:29,304
I'm not good at it.

30
00:02:29,304 --> 00:02:34,304
I want to grow up from where I am now.

31
00:02:34,304 --> 00:02:42,970
I hope that people will think that I can
grow up more.

32
00:02:43,890 --> 00:02:47,430
Yuno has been thinking about this for
four days.

33
00:02:51,010 --> 00:02:55,270
I've only been here for four days, but
I've been here for a month.

34
00:02:59,190 --> 00:03:01,150
Next, Kokona.

35
00:03:01,530 --> 00:03:06,110
I'm good at dancing, so I'm good at
singing.

36
00:03:06,110 --> 00:03:10,400
I'll do my best with confidence.

37
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:15,400
Kokona was showing an overwhelming dance
performance from the second screening.

38
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:26,234
The song is not good at all.

39
00:03:26,234 --> 00:03:31,234
I wanted to be more confident.

40
00:03:31,234 --> 00:03:35,234
There were many good singers around me.

41
00:03:35,234 --> 00:03:39,234
I was nervous.

42
00:03:39,234 --> 00:03:42,234
I was worried if I could sing well.

43
00:03:42,234 --> 00:03:50,234
I was very nervous.

44
00:03:50,234 --> 00:03:52,512
I was nervous.

45
00:03:52,512 --> 00:03:56,512
She has a regretful feeling about the
training camp.

46
00:03:57,512 --> 00:04:01,512
There is a video of Kokona practicing by
herself in her room.

47
00:04:02,512 --> 00:04:04,512
I'm going to practice.

48
00:04:04,512 --> 00:04:11,232
Relax the body and mind.

49
00:04:11,232 --> 00:04:14,232
I'm fine even if I get tired.

50
00:04:15,232 --> 00:04:19,232
I'm so tired just by dancing.

51
00:04:20,232 --> 00:04:24,232
I need a lot of strength to sing and
dance.

52
00:04:25,232 --> 00:04:27,232
I'll do my best.

53
00:04:31,232 --> 00:04:34,232
She puts on a fluffy pajamas and shoes.

54
00:04:34,232 --> 00:04:42,232
She's ready to dance.

55
00:04:42,394 --> 00:04:44,394
I'm sorry.

56
00:04:44,394 --> 00:04:46,394
I'm sorry.

57
00:04:46,394 --> 00:04:48,394
I'm sorry.

58
00:04:48,394 --> 00:04:50,874
I'm sorry.

59
00:04:50,874 --> 00:04:52,874
I'm tired

60
00:04:52,874 --> 00:04:54,874
I can't do it, I'm so tired

61
00:04:54,874 --> 00:04:56,874
I'm tired, I'm so tired

62
00:04:58,874 --> 00:05:00,874
Ah, it's hard

63
00:05:00,874 --> 00:05:02,874
I'm sorry

64
00:05:04,874 --> 00:05:06,874
Kokona, who has an adult-like image

65
00:05:06,874 --> 00:05:11,680
is still 15 years old

66
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:12,680
You look young

67
00:05:12,680 --> 00:05:13,680
Really?

68
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:15,680
I've been told that I look young

69
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:16,680
You look young

70
00:05:16,680 --> 00:05:18,680
I'm not as old as you are

71
00:05:18,680 --> 00:05:19,680
Really?

72
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:20,680
Yes

73
00:05:20,680 --> 00:05:28,480
Nono Kawa was impressive in his silence
and practice

74
00:05:28,480 --> 00:05:36,480
When I have an audition or an interview,
I don't know what to say when I'm
talking loudly

75
00:05:36,480 --> 00:05:42,480
I was told that I should talk loudly, so
I'm trying to talk loudly

76
00:05:42,480 --> 00:05:45,480
I see, you're really good

77
00:05:45,480 --> 00:05:54,480
Thanks to her sister's guidance, she has
been giving out her voice since she was
in the camp

78
00:05:55,008 --> 00:05:57,008
Nonoka's voice is amazing

79
00:05:57,008 --> 00:05:59,008
It's good to sing

80
00:06:01,008 --> 00:06:05,008
Nonoka was praised by her senior members
for her singing voice

81
00:06:07,008 --> 00:06:08,008
However

82
00:06:08,008 --> 00:06:12,008
I'm not sure if I can remember the dance

83
00:06:12,008 --> 00:06:14,008
I had a dream before

84
00:06:14,008 --> 00:06:19,008
I forgot the dance choreography at the
audition and I dreamt that I would fall
down

85
00:06:19,008 --> 00:06:21,008
I'm really scared

86
00:06:21,008 --> 00:06:30,008
She has been practicing nono-ka every
day to relieve her anxiety

87
00:06:43,322 --> 00:06:47,322
Then, suddenly, the music stopped.

88
00:06:52,474 --> 00:06:54,474
Walking and posing

89
00:07:04,474 --> 00:07:06,474
For some reason, he is alone

90
00:07:06,474 --> 00:07:08,474
Service shot

91
00:07:08,474 --> 00:07:22,474
This is walking and posing taught on the
first day of training

92
00:07:24,738 --> 00:07:27,738
It seems that she likes him a lot.

93
00:07:29,278 --> 00:07:30,278
By the way...

94
00:07:30,938 --> 00:07:32,158
This is my first interview.

95
00:07:32,158 --> 00:07:33,158
Your first?

96
00:07:33,158 --> 00:07:33,898
You're amazing.

97
00:07:33,898 --> 00:07:35,078
Really?

98
00:07:35,078 --> 00:07:36,078
I'm so excited.

99
00:07:36,078 --> 00:07:37,078
Thank you.

100
00:07:37,738 --> 00:07:39,578
You're excited? Why?

101
00:07:39,578 --> 00:07:40,738
Why?

102
00:07:40,738 --> 00:07:41,738
Who?

103
00:07:41,738 --> 00:07:42,738
My sister.

104
00:07:44,278 --> 00:07:47,738
She's still keeping her promise.

105
00:07:47,738 --> 00:07:48,738
Thank you.

106
00:07:48,738 --> 00:07:49,738
Thank you.

107
00:07:49,738 --> 00:07:53,280
May 5th, she received an interview like
this.

108
00:07:53,280 --> 00:08:01,946
thヽ

109
00:08:01,946 --> 00:08:08,946
The three members of Sakuragi, Kokona,
Kokubo, Yuno and Kazami are selected
from the audition

110
00:08:10,946 --> 00:08:14,946
The 9 members of the new Shirito Ebisu
middle school have started

111
00:08:14,946 --> 00:08:19,946
Thank you very much

112
00:08:21,946 --> 00:08:23,946
Just two days after the show

113
00:08:23,946 --> 00:08:30,560
The dance lesson of the new members
begins

114
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:35,560
My right arm hurts

115
00:08:36,560 --> 00:08:39,560
It's a hard lesson for the three members

116
00:08:40,560 --> 00:08:42,560
That's also the case

117
00:08:42,560 --> 00:08:54,394
The first live performance of the fan
meeting will be held in three months

118
00:08:54,394 --> 00:09:04,394
Thank you for watching!

119
00:09:05,666 --> 00:09:22,326
The set list of fanm Byan, who

120
00:09:20,926 --> 00:09:22,446
These three new members put their
efforts.

121
00:09:22,446 --> 00:09:25,286
I want something, I want something

122
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:29,600
When the lesson progresses, she misses
the real performance and does such a
special training.

123
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:34,600
For example, for the three of us, for
everyone's physical strength
enhancement,

124
00:09:34,600 --> 00:09:38,600
I want to continue with four songs.

125
00:09:38,600 --> 00:09:45,600
Basically, when it comes to live, it's
not about cutting one song at a time.

126
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:51,600
It's about continuing with three songs
or four songs, so I want to get used to
it.

127
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:56,600
That's it.

128
00:09:56,730 --> 00:10:00,730
They will dance 4 songs in a row.

129
00:10:13,926 --> 00:10:24,266
music

130
00:10:24,446 --> 00:10:33,946
N may not be called

131
00:10:33,946 --> 00:10:35,946
I want to send it to you

132
00:10:35,946 --> 00:10:37,946
I hope it reaches you

133
00:10:37,946 --> 00:10:41,946
I want to send it to you

134
00:10:41,946 --> 00:10:45,946
I want to send it to you

135
00:10:45,946 --> 00:10:47,946
Oh oh oh oh oh

136
00:10:47,946 --> 00:10:50,946
You are not a stranger

137
00:10:50,946 --> 00:10:53,946
You are not someone else

138
00:10:53,946 --> 00:10:55,946
Don't hesitate

139
00:10:55,946 --> 00:10:57,946
Don't hesitate

140
00:10:57,946 --> 00:11:03,066
I want to send it to you

141
00:11:03,066 --> 00:11:03,926
All the members foods are delicious!

142
00:11:03,926 --> 00:11:04,486
Let's eat!

143
00:11:04,486 --> 00:11:07,586
The night of school

144
00:11:12,766 --> 00:11:14,766
Dinner time

145
00:11:18,486 --> 00:11:20,686
One, two, three, four

146
00:11:20,686 --> 00:11:22,586
Never again!

147
00:11:23,610 --> 00:11:26,610
Next, we'll do the omegashi.

148
00:12:17,834 --> 00:12:25,834
I want to ask you to like me even if I'm
confused

149
00:12:25,834 --> 00:12:32,834
Nanana nanana nanana nanana nanana
nanana

150
00:12:32,834 --> 00:12:35,834
Yes, I'm embarrassed, I'm embarrassed

151
00:12:35,834 --> 00:12:38,834
I'm a little embarrassed

152
00:12:38,834 --> 00:12:41,834
I don't play, I don't go crazy

153
00:12:41,834 --> 00:12:48,834
I'm a little more embarrassed than I
thought

154
00:12:49,510 --> 00:12:55,510
I'm a little more embarrassed than I
thought

155
00:12:55,510 --> 00:12:58,510
I want to seduce you

156
00:12:58,510 --> 00:13:04,510
I fell in love with you

157
00:13:04,510 --> 00:13:12,510
I'm afraid that this feeling is
something strange

158
00:13:12,510 --> 00:13:19,510
I'm a little more nervous than I thought

159
00:13:19,510 --> 00:13:23,510
I wonder if I'll talk to you tomorrow

160
00:13:23,510 --> 00:13:27,510
I'm in your arms

161
00:13:27,510 --> 00:13:45,510
I'm in your arms

162
00:13:49,434 --> 00:13:56,374
1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15

163
00:13:56,432 --> 00:13:59,432
Okay, thank you for your hard work.

164
00:13:59,432 --> 00:14:01,432
It's hot.

165
00:14:01,432 --> 00:14:02,432
One block.

166
00:14:02,432 --> 00:14:04,432
I'm really going to do one block.

167
00:14:04,432 --> 00:14:07,432
But I'm not going to do this kind of
thing.

168
00:14:07,432 --> 00:14:09,432
I might do something else.

169
00:14:09,432 --> 00:14:11,432
Thank you for your hard work.

170
00:14:11,432 --> 00:14:12,432
One block.

171
00:14:12,432 --> 00:14:14,432
Thank you for your hard work.

172
00:14:14,432 --> 00:14:15,432
Okay.

173
00:14:15,432 --> 00:14:19,432
The practice of the investment has been
somehow formed.

174
00:14:19,432 --> 00:14:25,432
They watched the video and remembered it
very quickly.

175
00:14:25,432 --> 00:14:27,432
I'm surprised.

176
00:14:27,432 --> 00:14:30,432
I thought that I would be more confused
if I did it before.

177
00:14:30,432 --> 00:14:33,408
It's too fast.

178
00:14:33,408 --> 00:14:36,408
I will do it well.

179
00:14:36,408 --> 00:14:37,408
Yes.

180
00:14:38,408 --> 00:14:41,408
Please tell me the location.

181
00:14:42,408 --> 00:14:43,408
Here it is.

182
00:14:44,408 --> 00:14:47,408
It's amazing that this is the first live
performance.

183
00:14:47,408 --> 00:14:54,272
I will practice hard to reach my voice.

184
00:14:54,272 --> 00:14:57,832
I think I came here to work harder after
all.

185
00:15:00,372 --> 00:15:01,772
I hope I can succeed.

186
00:15:02,892 --> 00:15:05,092
I heard a little hum from the members of
Marimba course.

187
00:15:05,092 --> 00:15:07,012
I m excited.

188
00:15:07,012 --> 00:15:09,952
I feel a little lonely

189
00:15:09,952 --> 00:15:11,952
However...

190
00:15:21,130 --> 00:15:23,350
After about 3 month and dinner

191
00:15:24,070 --> 00:15:29,070
That's for their firstroll, they
advanced to user foes

192
00:15:32,630 --> 00:15:35,730
But they felt like it was not going to
work

193
00:15:38,930 --> 00:15:44,250
But now they gain confidence again. Wooo
Jay山!

194
00:15:44,250 --> 00:15:45,760
Thank you for watching!

195
00:15:45,760 --> 00:15:53,760
Finally, we will send a message to all
the members who were looking forward to
the family.

196
00:16:15,760 --> 00:16:20,760
Thank you for watching.

197
00:16:21,018 --> 00:16:29,018
I hate the city's chaos, it's a life-
threatening, nameless S.O.S.

198
00:16:29,018 --> 00:16:36,018
I know what you want to cry about, so
I'll go to you and break it down.

199
00:16:36,018 --> 00:16:39,018
Da-da-da-do-da-da, we'll cut through the
city,

200
00:16:39,018 --> 00:16:41,018
and run through the city,

201
00:16:41,018 --> 00:16:43,018
with our blood, sweat, and tears.

202
00:16:43,018 --> 00:16:44,858
Da-da-da-do-da-da

203
00:16:44,858 --> 00:16:46,458
Scream, cyber!

204
00:16:46,458 --> 00:16:48,098
I'll kill you,

205
00:16:48,098 --> 00:16:49,618
5-Chan-Zone!

206
00:16:49,618 --> 00:16:53,458
Let's break through the stupid rules!

207
00:16:53,458 --> 00:16:56,538
This voice is just a new one!

208
00:16:56,538 --> 00:17:00,378
I'll give you your own perfume!

209
00:17:00,378 --> 00:17:03,658
Because your heart will be able to play!

210
00:17:03,658 --> 00:17:05,458
The moment they're brave,

211
00:17:05,458 --> 00:17:07,378
10 billion years of our history!

212
00:17:07,378 --> 00:17:10,458
There's no way I'll wait!

213
00:17:10,458 --> 00:17:14,338
The noise that's been waiting for us is
the anthem!

214
00:17:14,338 --> 00:17:15,718
We'll�

215
00:17:15,770 --> 00:17:23,290
Please subscribe to my channel!

216
00:17:23,312 --> 00:17:27,112
We just bounce off all sorts of shutters

217
00:17:27,112 --> 00:17:30,912
These deputy following them

218
00:17:30,912 --> 00:17:37,852
They're never done with theirDAIYAMOON

219
00:17:37,852 --> 00:17:45,572
Breatomma, Dadada,

220
00:17:45,572 --> 00:17:48,072
Radada, I meant N柱

221
00:17:48,072 --> 00:17:51,352
Still normal, as usual

222
00:17:51,352 --> 00:17:55,152
If it's not a song, it's just one word

223
00:17:55,152 --> 00:17:58,252
That expectation is everything

224
00:17:58,252 --> 00:18:02,152
Let's raise your volume

225
00:18:02,152 --> 00:18:04,762
Makes our

226
00:18:04,762 --> 00:18:06,762
They are the brave star moments

227
00:18:06,762 --> 00:18:08,762
We have been waiting for ten billion
years

228
00:18:08,762 --> 00:18:12,154
There's no way we can wait

229
00:18:12,154 --> 00:18:14,154
What about the new members?

230
00:18:16,154 --> 00:18:20,154
If I get the chance, I'll make a new
wind blow.

231
00:18:20,154 --> 00:18:28,538
I'll do my best.

232
00:18:28,538 --> 00:18:47,418
S additive

233
00:18:47,418 --> 00:18:49,418
Thank you for watching!

234
00:19:00,666 --> 00:19:03,466
What was your identity?

235
00:19:03,466 --> 00:19:07,466
Words that didn't become songs

236
00:19:07,466 --> 00:19:11,466
I'm going to join the EVE chain and sing
for everyone.

237
00:19:11,466 --> 00:19:14,266
Let's raise the volume

238
00:19:14,266 --> 00:19:17,466
It can be heard in the background

239
00:19:17,466 --> 00:19:19,466
They are the moment of friendship

240
00:19:19,466 --> 00:19:23,514
We are waiting for one billion years

241
00:19:23,514 --> 00:19:32,714
Thank you for watching!

242
00:19:48,922 --> 00:19:52,922
Let's go wake up the LIGHTS!
