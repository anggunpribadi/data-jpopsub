1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,000
We are the three of us in cute costumes

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:10,000
Actually, on this day

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:13,000
We are the three of us

4
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:14,000
Please give us a good performance

5
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:19,000
The new members are close to the first
appearance on TV

6
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:23,000
So this time, Ebichu will appear
regularly

7
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:28,000
Kannai Devil and Zenmo Remix will have a
special collaboration

8
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,000
And

9
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:33,880
The three will enjoy the future of
Yokohama port

10
00:00:33,880 --> 00:00:36,160
There is a meaning

11
00:00:43,160 --> 00:00:47,360
On June 9th, the TV Kanagawa
headquarters in Yokohama

12
00:00:49,360 --> 00:00:52,480
There is the name of the shrimp member

13
00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:59,480
This is the day of recording the Kannai
Devil

14
00:00:59,712 --> 00:01:07,712
The Kannai Devil, where Ebi-chu is on a
regular show, is one of the most popular
TV shows in Kanagawa.

15
00:01:07,712 --> 00:01:18,928
Music variety shows are held every week
in the Kissa-ten in the Yoko-hama
Kannai.

16
00:01:18,928 --> 00:01:23,928
The three new members will be on the
show.

17
00:01:23,928 --> 00:01:30,688
This is the first time.

18
00:01:30,688 --> 00:01:34,688
This is the first time to record a TV
program as a member of Ebichu.

19
00:01:35,688 --> 00:01:37,688
I'm nervous.

20
00:01:37,688 --> 00:01:40,688
I'm going to be excited.

21
00:01:40,688 --> 00:01:42,688
Thank you.

22
00:01:43,688 --> 00:01:46,688
The one who will appear with the new
member is...

23
00:01:46,688 --> 00:01:47,688
Me?

24
00:01:47,688 --> 00:01:49,688
Thank you.

25
00:01:49,688 --> 00:01:53,688
The three reliable educational staff,
Boss Kashiwagi.

26
00:01:54,688 --> 00:01:56,688
I'm a little responsible.

27
00:01:56,688 --> 00:02:00,688
I wonder if I can do it. I hope the
three of us can talk.

28
00:02:00,688 --> 00:02:04,688
I remember the questionnaire.

29
00:02:05,688 --> 00:02:10,688
I don't know what I wrote. I can't talk.

30
00:02:10,688 --> 00:02:12,688
Thank you.

31
00:02:12,688 --> 00:02:19,248
The new member is...

32
00:02:19,248 --> 00:02:21,248
This is Mirei.

33
00:02:21,248 --> 00:02:25,248
She hasn't worn any costumes for the
show yet because she's a guest.

34
00:02:25,248 --> 00:02:27,248
She's wearing her senior's costume.

35
00:02:27,248 --> 00:02:30,248
But the size is perfect.

36
00:02:30,248 --> 00:02:31,248
It's cute.

37
00:02:31,248 --> 00:02:35,392
This is Mayama's costume.

38
00:02:35,392 --> 00:02:38,392
Let's get them ready before shooting
their scenes.

39
00:02:43,032 --> 00:02:45,292
Da Vinci!

40
00:02:48,732 --> 00:02:51,672
You'll wear them after you work.

41
00:02:51,672 --> 00:02:53,632
It's over.

42
00:02:53,632 --> 00:02:56,632
I'm going to work hard.

43
00:02:56,632 --> 00:02:58,632
I'm going to work hard.

44
00:02:58,632 --> 00:02:59,632
I'll work hard.

45
00:02:59,632 --> 00:03:01,632
Please take care of me.

46
00:03:11,632 --> 00:03:12,632
And then

47
00:03:12,632 --> 00:03:14,632
Excuse me, just one minute.

48
00:03:14,632 --> 00:03:16,632
Meeting before recording

49
00:03:16,632 --> 00:03:23,632
We're going to have a meeting with the
guests at the cafe.

50
00:03:23,632 --> 00:03:25,632
And we're going to have a free talk.

51
00:03:25,632 --> 00:03:27,632
So you can talk to the members.

52
00:03:27,632 --> 00:03:31,632
And we're going to have a fan meeting
and a fan meeting LP.

53
00:03:31,632 --> 00:03:33,632
We're going to have a fan meeting and an
LP.

54
00:03:33,632 --> 00:03:34,632
Let's go.

55
00:03:34,632 --> 00:03:35,632
Thank you.

56
00:03:35,632 --> 00:03:36,632
Cheer up.

57
00:03:36,632 --> 00:03:38,632
And let's work hard.

58
00:03:41,632 --> 00:03:43,632
Thank you.

59
00:03:43,632 --> 00:03:46,632
The staff is full of energy.

60
00:03:46,632 --> 00:03:51,632
They're going to have a free talk
without a script.

61
00:03:51,632 --> 00:03:54,632
Will they do it well?

62
00:03:54,632 --> 00:03:57,632
We'll start live streaming.

63
00:03:57,632 --> 00:03:59,632
Thank you.

64
00:04:01,632 --> 00:04:03,632
Please open the credits.

65
00:04:05,632 --> 00:04:07,632
Start the live streaming.

66
00:04:07,632 --> 00:04:10,632
Please enjoy the video.

67
00:04:10,632 --> 00:04:15,632
The third new member of Ebichu.

68
00:04:20,272 --> 00:04:22,272
You don't say anything?

69
00:04:22,272 --> 00:04:24,272
Please, please.

70
00:04:24,272 --> 00:04:26,272
That's voice-out NG.

71
00:04:26,272 --> 00:04:28,272
I'm sorry.

72
00:04:28,272 --> 00:04:30,272
You can't speak.

73
00:04:30,272 --> 00:04:32,272
You said it earlier.

74
00:04:32,272 --> 00:04:34,272
I have to protect it.

75
00:04:34,272 --> 00:04:36,272
What should we do?

76
00:04:36,272 --> 00:04:38,272
Should we ask Shouya to introduce?

77
00:04:38,272 --> 00:04:40,272
Yes.

78
00:04:40,272 --> 00:04:42,272
The history book.

79
00:04:42,272 --> 00:04:44,272
I think everyone will get it.

80
00:04:44,272 --> 00:04:46,272
You may work here.

81
00:04:46,272 --> 00:04:48,272
That's right.

82
00:04:48,272 --> 00:04:50,272
You're already here.

83
00:04:50,272 --> 00:04:52,272
It's too early.

84
00:04:52,272 --> 00:04:54,272
I'm number 13.

85
00:04:54,272 --> 00:04:56,272
My name is...

86
00:04:56,272 --> 00:04:58,272
Kokona Sakuragi.

87
00:05:00,272 --> 00:05:02,272
Is Kokona your real name?

88
00:05:02,272 --> 00:05:04,272
Yes.

89
00:05:04,272 --> 00:05:06,272
It's a very modern name.

90
00:05:06,272 --> 00:05:08,272
I'm number 14.

91
00:05:08,272 --> 00:05:10,272
I'm Yuno Kokobo.

92
00:05:10,272 --> 00:05:12,272
Yuno?

93
00:05:12,272 --> 00:05:14,272
That's your real name?

94
00:05:14,272 --> 00:05:16,272
Yes.

95
00:05:16,272 --> 00:05:18,272
I'm number 19. I'm number 15. I'm Kazami
Nanoka.

96
00:05:18,272 --> 00:05:20,272
Nanoka?

97
00:05:20,272 --> 00:05:22,272
That's your real name?

98
00:05:22,272 --> 00:05:24,272
That's your real name?

99
00:05:24,272 --> 00:05:26,272
It's 21st century.

100
00:05:26,272 --> 00:05:28,272
And the project called the job
interview.

101
00:05:28,272 --> 00:05:30,272
Check the history book you wrote in
advance.

102
00:05:30,272 --> 00:05:32,272
The picture.

103
00:05:32,272 --> 00:05:34,272
Do you want to go, Ms. Sakuragi?

104
00:05:34,272 --> 00:05:36,272
From Kokona.

105
00:05:36,272 --> 00:05:38,272
This is the picture.

106
00:05:38,272 --> 00:05:40,272
This is the picture.

107
00:05:40,272 --> 00:05:42,272
This is the picture.

108
00:05:42,272 --> 00:05:44,272
I'm not doing it properly.

109
00:05:44,272 --> 00:05:46,272
I'm not doing it properly.

110
00:05:46,272 --> 00:05:48,272
Oh well.

111
00:05:48,272 --> 00:05:50,272
Oh well.

112
00:05:50,272 --> 00:05:52,272
The last one is the biggest problem.

113
00:05:52,272 --> 00:05:54,272
Yuno Kokobo.

114
00:05:54,272 --> 00:05:58,092
This one is the most

115
00:05:58,092 --> 00:06:00,092
This one is the most

116
00:06:00,092 --> 00:06:01,272
This is the most

117
00:06:01,272 --> 00:06:03,272
This is the most

118
00:06:03,272 --> 00:06:05,272
You're a little too early.

119
00:06:05,272 --> 00:06:07,272
You're too early.

120
00:06:07,272 --> 00:06:09,272
Why did you get a forehead?

121
00:06:09,272 --> 00:06:11,272
What are you doing?

122
00:06:11,272 --> 00:06:14,272
It's a pretty forehead.

123
00:06:14,272 --> 00:06:16,272
This and that.

124
00:06:16,272 --> 00:06:18,272
Noroko?

125
00:06:18,272 --> 00:06:24,272
Everyone wrote their own private private
school.

126
00:06:24,272 --> 00:06:26,272
This is

127
00:06:26,272 --> 00:06:30,272
When we saw it, we thought it was a
joke.

128
00:06:30,272 --> 00:06:32,272
Yes.

129
00:06:32,272 --> 00:06:34,272
Private Subie Middle School.

130
00:06:34,272 --> 00:06:36,272
I'm doing it.

131
00:06:36,272 --> 00:06:38,272
It's a little bit of a good thing.

132
00:06:38,272 --> 00:06:44,272
The first TV appearance is a shocking
development.

133
00:06:44,272 --> 00:06:47,584
Thank you very much.

134
00:06:47,584 --> 00:06:52,584
But the MC leads the show, and the fun
recording ends.

135
00:06:54,144 --> 00:06:57,144
Thank you for your hard work.

136
00:06:57,144 --> 00:06:58,144
How was it?

137
00:06:58,144 --> 00:07:00,144
It was fun.

138
00:07:00,144 --> 00:07:02,144
It was fun.

139
00:07:02,144 --> 00:07:05,144
I was talking a lot today, but I'm glad.

140
00:07:05,144 --> 00:07:06,144
I was relieved.

141
00:07:06,144 --> 00:07:08,144
I was able to talk.

142
00:07:08,144 --> 00:07:10,144
I'm glad.

143
00:07:10,144 --> 00:07:12,144
Thank you for your hard work.

144
00:07:14,144 --> 00:07:18,144
The two MCs who usually perform with the
Ebi-Chuu members

145
00:07:18,144 --> 00:07:21,144
Let us hear the impressions of the new
members.

146
00:07:21,144 --> 00:07:23,144
The new members who are not in the Ebi-
Chuu team

147
00:07:23,144 --> 00:07:25,144
You were shining.

148
00:07:25,144 --> 00:07:27,144
I was fresh.

149
00:07:27,144 --> 00:07:29,144
You were shining.

150
00:07:29,144 --> 00:07:31,144
You were bright.

151
00:07:31,144 --> 00:07:33,144
You have a lot of things that we don't
have.

152
00:07:33,144 --> 00:07:35,144
You have a lot of things that I don't
have.

153
00:07:35,144 --> 00:07:37,144
I'll re-check what I lost.

154
00:07:39,144 --> 00:07:41,144
You were really cute.

155
00:07:41,144 --> 00:07:43,144
Everyone is cute.

156
00:07:43,144 --> 00:07:46,144
I've been watching the audition video.

157
00:07:46,144 --> 00:07:48,144
I'm glad I finally met you.

158
00:07:48,144 --> 00:07:51,144
I was recording, and you were so cute.

159
00:07:51,144 --> 00:07:54,144
I said it many times that I was cute.

160
00:07:54,144 --> 00:07:56,144
It's a unique industry.

161
00:07:56,144 --> 00:08:02,144
I'm glad to be able to work with people
who are so far away from the city.

162
00:08:02,144 --> 00:08:04,144
I'm looking forward to it.

163
00:08:04,144 --> 00:08:08,144
I'd like you to join the shift.

164
00:08:08,144 --> 00:08:11,408
Thank you.

165
00:08:11,408 --> 00:08:15,408
So, the three of them will appear in the
show.

166
00:08:15,408 --> 00:08:20,752
Please check the show.

167
00:08:20,752 --> 00:08:23,752
Before the show was recorded on this
day,

168
00:08:24,752 --> 00:08:29,752
the three people who came to Yokohama
had a place they wanted to see.

169
00:08:30,752 --> 00:08:32,752
Good morning.

170
00:08:33,752 --> 00:08:40,752
We came to see the fan meeting at
Akarenga Park.

171
00:08:40,752 --> 00:08:46,752
This is Akarenga Park, the venue of the
fan meeting 2021.

172
00:08:46,752 --> 00:08:50,752
The venue of the fan meeting was
canceled last year.

173
00:08:50,752 --> 00:08:51,752
And...

174
00:08:52,752 --> 00:08:58,752
Thank you for waiting, Ebisu Junior High
School and the audience.

175
00:08:58,752 --> 00:09:07,376
The music festival was held in memory of
the 10th anniversary of Ebisu Junior
High School.

176
00:09:07,376 --> 00:09:12,616
The future of the people who shine

177
00:09:12,616 --> 00:09:17,376
We always wish for it

178
00:09:17,376 --> 00:09:19,376
The blue stars are now shining

179
00:09:19,376 --> 00:09:27,376
Ebichu's most important place was chosen
for the debut live of the three new
members.

180
00:09:27,376 --> 00:09:33,376
To find the stage location by hinting at
the photo of the music festival

181
00:09:33,376 --> 00:09:38,376
The wind is strong

182
00:09:38,376 --> 00:09:42,376
The wind is strong

183
00:09:42,376 --> 00:09:44,376
What is this?

184
00:09:44,376 --> 00:09:46,376
There is a red one here

185
00:09:46,376 --> 00:09:48,376
Isn't it around here?

186
00:09:48,376 --> 00:09:50,376
Isn't it here?

187
00:09:50,376 --> 00:09:52,376
Isn't it here?

188
00:09:52,376 --> 00:09:54,376
Isn't it around here?

189
00:09:54,376 --> 00:09:56,376
It's around here

190
00:09:56,376 --> 00:10:01,376
The wind is strong

191
00:10:01,376 --> 00:10:05,376
Grandpa, please tell us the location

192
00:10:05,376 --> 00:10:07,376
Here

193
00:10:07,376 --> 00:10:09,376
It's here

194
00:10:09,376 --> 00:10:11,376
It's more forward

195
00:10:11,376 --> 00:10:15,376
We'll make a stage here so it might be
more forward

196
00:10:15,376 --> 00:10:16,376
Here?

197
00:10:16,376 --> 00:10:18,376
It's right here

198
00:10:18,376 --> 00:10:20,376
We'll make a stage here

199
00:10:20,376 --> 00:10:22,376
Here

200
00:10:22,376 --> 00:10:25,376
There are people in the building

201
00:10:25,376 --> 00:10:28,376
You mean they are in the farthest part
of the field?

202
00:10:28,376 --> 00:10:31,376
Yes, to the farthest part of the field

203
00:10:33,776 --> 00:10:37,616
Next month, the three of them will have
their debut live here

204
00:10:39,168 --> 00:10:43,168
It's been over a month since they joined
the group, and what does she think?

205
00:10:43,168 --> 00:10:45,168
It's so fast.

206
00:10:45,168 --> 00:10:50,168
If it's been a month, we would have been
able to perform at the fan meeting.

207
00:10:50,168 --> 00:10:53,168
It's crazy to have our first live
performance here.

208
00:10:53,168 --> 00:10:56,168
I want to do my best to reach out to my
fans.

209
00:10:56,168 --> 00:10:59,168
I want to practice hard with the voice.

210
00:11:00,168 --> 00:11:04,168
I thought I had to do my best here.

211
00:11:04,168 --> 00:11:09,168
I'm glad that the people who came here
and passed by me thought it was a good
idea.

212
00:11:09,168 --> 00:11:11,168
It was a great success.

213
00:11:11,168 --> 00:11:13,168
It was a success.

214
00:11:13,168 --> 00:11:15,168
I'm happy that it was a success.

215
00:11:16,168 --> 00:11:20,168
I still don't know because I don't have
a good feeling.

216
00:11:20,168 --> 00:11:23,168
And, Kokona was a little worried.

217
00:11:24,168 --> 00:11:30,168
I was worried that I would be okay if I
could say that there were customers in
the back of the stage.

218
00:11:30,168 --> 00:11:34,168
I'm grateful that it was such a big
place. I'm very nervous.

219
00:11:34,168 --> 00:11:40,168
When one of the managers shook his hand,
I realized that I was going to stay
here.

220
00:11:40,168 --> 00:11:43,168
I'm getting closer to the fan meeting.

221
00:11:43,168 --> 00:11:45,168
I'm very excited.

222
00:11:46,168 --> 00:11:49,168
The three have made up their minds.

223
00:11:49,168 --> 00:11:55,168
The fan meeting 2021 has been decided
and will be held in two days.

224
00:11:55,168 --> 00:12:00,168
The hot summer for Ebi-Chu is about to
begin.
