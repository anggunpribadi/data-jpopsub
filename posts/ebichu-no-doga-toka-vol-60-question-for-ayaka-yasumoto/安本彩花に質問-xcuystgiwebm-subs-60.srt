00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:49,640
I don't know if I can do it in this
situation.

13
00:00:49,640 --> 00:00:53,040
I want to deepen our friendship.

My mother's father gave me this kanji.

22
00:01:28,800 --> 00:01:32,400
I have a original kanji, but I don't
know if I can use it.

23
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:34,280

I think everyone is mature.

27
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:49,960

What was the most fun shooting the MV
for IA HON RIOT?

37
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:25,600
This is lip sync.

38
00:02:25,600 --> 00:02:30,786
I sing alone and move.

39
00:02:30,786 --> 00:02:37,546
This was a scene in the shrimp MV for
the first time in a long time.

40
00:02:37,546 --> 00:02:39,486
This is a very fresh scene.

41
00:02:39,486 --> 00:02:42,826
I felt like I was an idol.

42
00:02:42,826 --> 00:02:44,826
I had a lot of fun.

43
00:02:44,826 --> 00:02:48,386

Is it a boyfriend?

46
00:02:52,546 --> 00:02:56,066
Is it a girlfriend?

47
00:02:56,066 --> 00:02:58,666

both.

00:03:14,226 --> 00:03:18,226
I say this every day because I want to
eat grilled meat.

53
00:03:18,226 --> 00:03:23,266
Next, the vivid green hair color is very
nice.

54

I want to imitate the characters.

61
00:03:49,826 --> 00:03:53,586
Next, how is the distance between you
and TOMATO?

62
00:03:53,586 --> 00:04:00,026
I think the distance is close because
it's summer.

63
00:04:00,026 --> 00:04:04,306
I think everyone is close.

64
00:04:04,306 --> 00:04:08,586
Next, where would you like to go if you
could play freely?

65

Next, is there a time you can't cut your
hair at this time?

00:04:21,826 --> 00:04:25,626
I like to brush my teeth.

00:04:25,626 --> 00:04:30,186
I have about four types of toothbrushes.

70
00:04:30,186 --> 00:04:34,386
I use them every day.

71
00:04:34,386 --> 00:04:37,426
I change them depending on my mood.

72
00:04:37,426 --> 00:04:39,986
I can't waste my time brushing my teeth.

73
00:04:39,986 --> 00:04:42,626
I think everyone is like that.

74
00:04:42,626 --> 00:04:44,266

81
00:05:07,490 --> 00:05:08,970
I want to hear it.

82
00:05:08,970 --> 00:05:11,810
I love that.

83
00:05:11,810 --> 00:05:12,890
Next.

going to Hokkaido lately.

00:05:23,690 --> 00:05:31,330
I remember going to Hokkaido the most
when I was on TV and radio.

88
00:05:31,330 --> 00:05:33,450
I had a lot of fun there.

89
00:05:33,450 --> 00:05:37,290
I ate delicious sushi and ate it.

90
00:05:37,290 --> 00:05:40,770

go there again.

91

00:05:41,690 --> 00:05:43,090
Do you like saunas?

93
00:05:43,090 --> 00:05:46,610
I want to try to get ready for the
sauna.

94
00:05:46,610 --> 00:05:51,050
I'm not brave enough to go to the sauna.

95
00:05:51,050 --> 00:05:53,970
I definitely want to go to the sauna
someday.

96
00:05:53,970 --> 00:05:56,050

recently?

102
00:06:12,370 --> 00:06:17,010
I try not to think that I've made a
mistake recently.

103
00:06:17,010 --> 00:06:21,370
If you look at it, it may be a failure.

104
00:06:21,370 --> 00:06:25,010
I'm doing anything because I feel like
I've succeeded.

105
00:06:25,010 --> 00:06:26,250

112
00:06:50,530 --> 00:06:52,730
I think it's cool.

113
00:06:52,730 --> 00:06:56,850
I want to try it too.

114
00:06:56,850 --> 00:07:01,210
I want to try it if I have a chance.

115
00:07:01,210 --> 00:07:03,970
What is your morning routine?

116
00:07:03,970 --> 00:07:09,250
I only do my morning routine when I wake
up, wash my face, and brush my teeth.

117
00:07:09,250 --> 00:07:14,770
I don't do much.

safe.

match.

00:07:43,042 --> 00:07:49,082
I often drink coffee at break time.

126
00:07:49,082 --> 00:07:51,602
I think I've grown up.

127
00:07:53,722 --> 00:07:55,122
How should I do it?

128
00:07:55,122 --> 00:08:01,642
Next, please tell me a book you've
recently read.

129
00:08:01,642 --> 00:08:12,682
I've been reading the essay book written
by Osaki Sekai-kan.

130
00:08:12,682 --> 00:08:20,162
I feel like the world of the lyrics of
the song has become a book.

131
00:08:20,162 --> 00:08:30,082
I'm able to imagine a lot of things.

132
00:08:30,082 --> 00:08:34,882
I feel like I'm a world-famous writer.

133

I think it's very interesting to read.

135
00:08:41,282 --> 00:08:46,882
Next, please tell me how you spend your
time at home.

136
00:08:46,882 --> 00:08:52,362
I often watch movies.

137
00:08:52,362 --> 00:08:59,962
I often watch the best scenes of my
favorite actresses.

138
00:08:59,962 --> 00:09:04,442
I often send them to RICO, CAFO, MAYAMA,
and so on.

139
00:09:04,442 --> 00:09:10,682

saying anything.

Next, please tell me your favorite
student.

146
00:09:36,362 --> 00:09:39,242
I am worried because it is my first time
to take a junior high school exam.

147
00:09:39,242 --> 00:09:40,962
Please support me.

148
00:09:40,962 --> 00:09:43,322
I don't feel like I'm going to take the
exam.

149
00:09:43,322 --> 00:09:45,322
I look forward to the exam.

150
00:09:45,322 --> 00:09:55,122

Next, please tell me your favorite idol.

154
00:10:04,442 --> 00:10:07,266
He was delighted.

155
00:10:07,266 --> 00:10:17,666
There is a difference between supporting
actresses, actors, and artists.

156
00:10:17,666 --> 00:10:26,146
I feel that idols are only good at
giving energy.

157
00:10:26,146 --> 00:10:34,626
When I watch a music program, I feel
that the moment idols appear, the energy
is coming from them.

158
00:10:34,626 --> 00:10:38,986
I feel that idols only give me energy.

159
00:10:38,986 --> 00:10:41,866
I feel that I am energetic and shiny.

160
00:10:41,866 --> 00:10:45,466
I will participate in a conversation for
the first time this time.

161
00:10:45,466 --> 00:10:47,906
How should I talk to you?

162
00:10:47,906 --> 00:10:51,146
I talk to my classmates.

163
00:10:51,146 --> 00:10:56,346
I talk to my classmates for the first
time.

164
00:10:56,346 --> 00:10:59,666
Please talk to me like that.

165
00:10:59,666 --> 00:11:03,746
Next, what song do you recommend for
beginners?

166
00:11:03,746 --> 00:11:10,746
Many people want to know that EBI-CHU is
a 9-member organization.

167
00:11:10,746 --> 00:11:15,866
I will start with IYAHON LIGHT.

168
00:11:17,866 --> 00:11:20,746
Next.

169
00:11:20,746 --> 00:11:26,466
I said that I was looking forward to the
new members entering the EBI-CHU
audition.

170
00:11:26,466 --> 00:11:29,866
I said that I would practice to increase
the number of seniors.

171
00:11:29,866 --> 00:11:33,666
Did you make me blow the seniors' wind?

172
00:11:33,666 --> 00:11:39,386
Who is the first senior member who blows
the seniors' wind?

173
00:11:39,386 --> 00:11:44,706
I think I'm blowing the seniors' wind.

174
00:11:44,706 --> 00:11:47,946
I think I'm blowing the seniors' wind.

175
00:11:47,946 --> 00:11:53,026
I'm a little older than the seniors.

176
00:11:53,026 --> 00:12:01,946
I was in a different position from when
I was in the Kaoriko team.

177
00:12:01,946 --> 00:12:11,986
I was conscious of saying that I was
going to do it.

178
00:12:11,986 --> 00:12:15,266
I think I'm the one who blows the
seniors' wind the most.

179
00:12:15,266 --> 00:12:17,706
I have confidence in that.

180
00:12:17,706 --> 00:12:19,626
Next.

181
00:12:19,626 --> 00:12:22,746
What is the most funny thing that
happened recently?

182
00:12:22,746 --> 00:12:27,386
What is the funniest thing that happened
recently?

183
00:12:27,386 --> 00:12:32,266
I often get laughed at by YUNO recently.

184
00:12:32,266 --> 00:12:37,266
I am surprised by YUNO's actions.

185
00:12:37,266 --> 00:12:39,330
This is interesting.

186
00:12:39,330 --> 00:12:41,910
She is a very different person.

187
00:12:41,910 --> 00:12:44,550
I laugh a lot because I think she is
interesting.

188
00:12:45,810 --> 00:12:47,090
Next.

189
00:12:47,090 --> 00:12:49,890
Who do you want to be replaced with a
member for a day?

190
00:12:49,890 --> 00:12:51,370
Who do you want to be replaced with a
member for a week?

191
00:12:51,370 --> 00:12:53,490
Who do you want to be reborn?

192
00:12:56,090 --> 00:12:58,410
I want to be replaced with MIRAYA for a
day.

193
00:12:58,410 --> 00:13:03,330
I want to be replaced with MIRAYA for a
day.

194
00:13:03,330 --> 00:13:08,970
I want to be replaced with RIKKO for a
week.

195
00:13:08,970 --> 00:13:13,370
I want to be replaced with RIKKO for a
week.

196
00:13:14,370 --> 00:13:21,090
If I were to be reborn, I would be a
different person.

197
00:13:21,090 --> 00:13:25,010
I want to be reborn as a member of
COCONA.

198
00:13:25,010 --> 00:13:26,690
I'm not a member of COCONA anymore.

199
00:13:26,690 --> 00:13:31,050
I want to be reborn as a member of
COCONA.

200
00:13:31,050 --> 00:13:40,010
I want to be reborn as a member of
COCONA.

201
00:13:40,010 --> 00:13:41,530
Next.

202
00:13:41,530 --> 00:13:45,050
Who do you respect?

203
00:13:45,050 --> 00:13:48,490
This is a difficult question.

204
00:13:48,490 --> 00:14:00,490
I respect everyone I meet.

205
00:14:00,490 --> 00:14:10,610
I want to collect the good points of
everyone I meet.

206
00:14:10,610 --> 00:14:16,850
I don't want to be a different person.

207
00:14:16,850 --> 00:14:17,890
Next.

208
00:14:17,890 --> 00:14:23,730
Who do you respect the most when you see
a new member?

209
00:14:23,730 --> 00:14:31,330
I respect MONOKA very much.

210
00:14:31,330 --> 00:14:38,570
I think I'm different from when I was in
middle school.

211
00:14:38,570 --> 00:14:43,010
I respect that.

212
00:14:43,010 --> 00:14:46,210
I think I'm a great person.

213
00:14:46,210 --> 00:14:51,930
I want to learn from everyone and do my
best.

214
00:14:51,930 --> 00:14:57,330
Next. What is your favorite part of
ONIGIRI?

215
00:14:57,330 --> 00:15:00,730
I will say UME.

216
00:15:00,730 --> 00:15:07,410
What did you think of YASUMOTO PRODUCE's
dance set?

217
00:15:07,410 --> 00:15:15,210
I talked about it at the meeting.

218
00:15:15,210 --> 00:15:21,650
I forgot the atmosphere of the live
performance.

219
00:15:21,650 --> 00:15:25,122
I was excited.

220
00:15:25,122 --> 00:15:32,082
Then everyone was tired of it.

221
00:15:32,082 --> 00:15:34,922
Everyone said that I was a demon.

222
00:15:34,922 --> 00:15:48,842
But I was relieved that the members said
that I was interesting.

223
00:15:48,842 --> 00:15:55,842
Next, what are the words that the
members say to you?

224
00:15:55,842 --> 00:16:00,842
I am happy to be called cute.

225
00:16:00,842 --> 00:16:10,842
When I see the pictures of the MV, I am
excited to see the comments.

226
00:16:10,842 --> 00:16:15,842
Next, what kind of conversation do you
have with NONOKA?

227
00:16:15,842 --> 00:16:19,842
All three of us say something suddenly.

228
00:16:19,842 --> 00:16:25,842
I look at the picture and say something.

229
00:16:25,842 --> 00:16:30,842
I'm scared.

230
00:16:30,842 --> 00:16:34,842
I say something that I don't understand.

231
00:16:34,842 --> 00:16:39,842
I'm really funny.

232
00:16:39,842 --> 00:16:53,842
Next, what is the support of Yasumoto
that you can get when you are in pain?

233
00:16:53,842 --> 00:17:09,842
I get strength from the people around
me.

234
00:17:09,842 --> 00:17:20,842
I get strength from the staff who
support me.

235
00:17:20,842 --> 00:17:25,842
Next, shout out what you want to shout
out.

236
00:17:25,842 --> 00:17:30,842
What is it?

237
00:17:30,842 --> 00:17:33,842
I want to eat chocolate.

238
00:17:33,842 --> 00:17:35,842
I shout out nothing.

239
00:17:35,842 --> 00:17:37,842
I have a small voice.

240
00:17:37,842 --> 00:17:40,842
I shouted out my feelings.

241
00:17:40,842 --> 00:17:47,842
What do you call the three new members?

242
00:17:47,842 --> 00:17:52,842
I call NONOKA, COCONA, and COCO.

243
00:17:52,842 --> 00:17:55,842
I call them UNOPE.

244
00:17:55,842 --> 00:17:57,842
I think it's a good nickname.

245
00:17:57,842 --> 00:18:02,754
Next, what is the secret to your hard
work?

246
00:18:02,754 --> 00:18:08,554
I think it's a habit to work hard.

247
00:18:08,554 --> 00:18:13,754
I'm trying to do my best every day.

248
00:18:13,754 --> 00:18:16,194
It's natural to work hard.

249
00:18:19,194 --> 00:18:22,074
It's not a heavy thing.

250
00:18:22,074 --> 00:18:25,274
I feel like I can work hard as usual.

251
00:18:25,274 --> 00:18:27,234
I don't know if it's a body.

252
00:18:29,034 --> 00:18:31,794
I think so.

253
00:18:31,794 --> 00:18:34,634
Next.

254
00:18:34,634 --> 00:18:41,034
What song would you like to sing if you
could sing the first take?

255
00:18:41,034 --> 00:18:46,274
I want to sing this song by counting the
stars.

256
00:18:46,274 --> 00:18:53,674
Our harmony is very important.

257
00:18:53,674 --> 00:19:02,394
I think it will be a simple performance.

258
00:19:02,394 --> 00:19:04,554
Next.

259
00:19:04,554 --> 00:19:08,514
What is your job other than live
performance?

260
00:19:08,514 --> 00:19:15,114
I'm used to my hair style, so I don't
have to do it.

261
00:19:15,114 --> 00:19:19,394
I want to leave a lot of hair.

262
00:19:19,394 --> 00:19:28,714
I want to leave a lot of memories.

263
00:19:28,714 --> 00:19:35,154
I want to take pictures and make a
movie.

264
00:19:35,154 --> 00:19:42,634
I want to do what I am now.

265
00:19:42,634 --> 00:19:46,874
I want to be a model.

266
00:19:46,874 --> 00:19:53,954
I answered about 50 questions.

267
00:19:53,954 --> 00:19:56,834
Thank you for your questions.

268
00:19:56,834 --> 00:20:01,354
I answered too many questions.

269
00:20:01,354 --> 00:20:05,314
It was difficult.

270
00:20:05,314 --> 00:20:14,194
I will continue to answer questions.

271
00:20:14,194 --> 00:20:21,714
I would be happy if you could ask me a
lot of questions.

272
00:20:21,714 --> 00:20:31,074
I will read the questions I received.

273
00:20:31,074 --> 00:20:36,434
Thank you for your continued support.

274
00:20:36,434 --> 00:20:39,354
That was the question for YASUMOTA
EYAKA.

275
00:20:39,354 --> 00:20:46,514
Bye bye.
