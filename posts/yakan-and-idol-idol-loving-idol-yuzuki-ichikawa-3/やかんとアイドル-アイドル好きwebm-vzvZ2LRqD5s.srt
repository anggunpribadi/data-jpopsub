1
00:00:01,914 --> 00:00:03,914
I'm an idol!

2
00:00:10,138 --> 00:00:13,138
Second, friends.

3
00:00:13,138 --> 00:00:15,138
Yes, friends.

4
00:00:15,138 --> 00:00:19,138
I love spending time with my friends.

5
00:00:19,138 --> 00:00:25,138
I feel like I live my life to spend time
with my friends.

6
00:00:25,138 --> 00:00:31,138
I go to school to meet my friends.

7
00:00:31,138 --> 00:00:34,138
I prioritize my friends the most.

8
00:00:34,138 --> 00:00:38,112
I have a schedule.

9
00:00:38,112 --> 00:00:41,112
I like to write it down.

10
00:00:41,112 --> 00:00:46,112
I spend my free time with my friends.

11
00:00:46,112 --> 00:00:49,112
I don't have any free time during my
schedule.

12
00:00:49,112 --> 00:00:50,112
That's amazing.

13
00:00:50,112 --> 00:00:53,112
I spend my time with my friends.

14
00:00:53,112 --> 00:00:55,112
If I have time.

15
00:00:55,112 --> 00:00:58,864
I spend my time with my friends.

16
00:00:58,864 --> 00:01:00,864
But most of my friends are college
students.

17
00:01:00,864 --> 00:01:01,864
Oh, college students.

18
00:01:01,864 --> 00:01:03,864
Most of my friends are college students.

19
00:01:03,864 --> 00:01:07,864
We usually meet after the university or
after the lesson.

20
00:01:07,864 --> 00:01:09,864
We meet at my hometown.

21
00:01:10,864 --> 00:01:12,864
We meet at the workplace.

22
00:01:12,864 --> 00:01:13,864
We meet at the workplace.

23
00:01:13,864 --> 00:01:17,864
And at this age, everyone starts to have
a driver's license.

24
00:01:17,864 --> 00:01:18,864
Oh, I see.

25
00:01:18,864 --> 00:01:19,864
Yes.

26
00:01:19,864 --> 00:01:26,864
So, I can drive to the store when I
can't meet my friends.

27
00:01:26,864 --> 00:01:27,864
You can.

28
00:01:27,864 --> 00:01:28,256
I see.

29
00:01:28,256 --> 00:01:35,056
I have a lot of money, and I've been
driving with my friends lately.

30
00:01:35,056 --> 00:01:36,556
Don't you study?

31
00:01:36,556 --> 00:01:38,556
I want to study!

32
00:01:38,556 --> 00:01:40,556
But I...

33
00:01:40,556 --> 00:01:43,556
There was a go-kart at Disneyland,
right?

34
00:01:43,556 --> 00:01:44,556
Was there?

35
00:01:44,556 --> 00:01:45,556
There was.

36
00:01:45,556 --> 00:01:46,556
Was there?

37
00:01:46,556 --> 00:01:53,556
It's a really simple one, but I'm really
bad at it.

38
00:01:53,556 --> 00:01:54,556
That's pretty good.

39
00:01:54,556 --> 00:01:57,456
Yeah, but I'm good at Mario Kart.

40
00:01:58,456 --> 00:02:00,456
I'm good at Mario Kart.

41
00:02:00,456 --> 00:02:07,456
I'm not good at Mario Kart, but my mom
told me I shouldn't get a driver's
license.

42
00:02:07,456 --> 00:02:09,456
I'm a little nervous.

43
00:02:09,456 --> 00:02:12,456
Do you have any friends?

44
00:02:12,456 --> 00:02:14,456
I don't have any friends.

45
00:02:14,456 --> 00:02:16,456
I want to be able to do it all.

46
00:02:16,456 --> 00:02:18,456
That's nice.

47
00:02:18,456 --> 00:02:21,456
Have you had friends since junior high
school?

48
00:02:21,456 --> 00:02:32,456
I have friends from elementary school,
junior high school, high school, and
idol friends.

49
00:02:32,456 --> 00:02:34,456
I see.

50
00:02:34,456 --> 00:02:36,456
I have a staff idol.

51
00:02:36,456 --> 00:02:37,456
Who is it?

52
00:02:37,456 --> 00:02:39,456
The first one to appear was Fujita Airi.

53
00:02:39,456 --> 00:02:44,456
We've been getting along really well.

54
00:02:44,456 --> 00:02:51,456
I recently went to eat udon with Ayame
Kawata, who is a member of UUKKA.

55
00:02:51,456 --> 00:02:53,456
Is that true?

56
00:02:53,456 --> 00:02:54,456
Is Ayame in your family?

57
00:02:54,456 --> 00:02:57,456
Ayame is two years older than me.

58
00:02:57,456 --> 00:02:59,456
She's the same age as Moeka.

59
00:02:59,456 --> 00:03:02,456
Moeka is sometimes on TV.

60
00:03:02,456 --> 00:03:05,456
I have to keep an eye on her.

61
00:03:05,456 --> 00:03:06,456
That's right.

62
00:03:06,456 --> 00:03:08,456
Moeka is the one who does this.

63
00:03:08,456 --> 00:03:09,456
That's right.

64
00:03:09,456 --> 00:03:11,456
That's her role.

65
00:03:11,456 --> 00:03:14,394
I'm looking forward to seeing her.

66
00:03:14,394 --> 00:03:17,394
I want to be the cutest girl in the
world.

67
00:03:17,394 --> 00:03:22,394
I'm confident that I can be the cutest
girl in the world.

68
00:03:39,648 --> 00:03:42,648
I received it from Ryo-san.

69
00:03:42,648 --> 00:03:48,221
Thank you very much.
