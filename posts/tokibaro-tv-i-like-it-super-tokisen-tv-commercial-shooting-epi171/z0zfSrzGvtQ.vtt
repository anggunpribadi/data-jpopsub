 Good morning.

00:24.250 --> 00:26.250
 The puddle is big.

00:26.250 --> 00:28.250
 It's a rainy day.

00:28.250 --> 00:30.250
 It's going to be sunny.

00:31.250 --> 00:33.250
 I forgot to bring an umbrella.

00:37.250 --> 00:38.250
 What's that?

00:38.250 --> 00:39.250
 A mole?

00:42.250 --> 00:44.250
 I didn't know that.

00:44.250 --> 00:46.250
 The puddle is big.

00:46.250 --> 00:49.250
 I'm going to cross the river.

00:49.250 --> 00:52.250
 I'm going to cross the river.

01:02.384 --> 01:05.384
 There might be a four-leaf clover.

01:05.384 --> 01:25.384
 I'm looking for a four-leaf clover.

01:35.626 --> 01:37.766
 Franco

01:37.766 --> 01:41.026

02:02.066 --> 02:04.066
 The beginning.

02:10.842 --> 02:12.842
 The last one is Yui!

02:17.842 --> 02:21.842
 5,4,3,2,1

02:22.842 --> 02:24.842
 Yui is the last one!

02:25.842 --> 02:27.842
 Yui's last one is Yui!

02:31.842 --> 02:33.842
 Yui's last one is Yui!

02:34.842 --> 02:36.842
 Yui's last one is Yui!

02:36.842 --> 02:38.842

03:01.808 --> 03:03.808
 What should I do to make you look back?

03:03.808 --> 03:07.808
 I thought I had to change myself more.

03:07.808 --> 03:09.808
 I thought so.

03:11.808 --> 03:12.808
 Titanic.

03:12.808 --> 03:14.808
 I love you.

03:16.808 --> 03:17.808

03:24.026 --> 03:26.026
 We are Super TAKIMEKI!

03:26.026 --> 03:28.026
 Oh, the sun is coming out!

03:28.026 --> 03:30.026
 It's sunny.

03:30.026 --> 03:32.026
 The sun is shining.

03:32.026 --> 03:34.026
 The sun is shining.

03:34.026 --> 03:36.026
 The sun is shining.

03:36.026 --> 03:48.026
 The sun is shining.

03:49.624 --> 03:50.624
 Mind blowing!

 I'm about to burst, I can't take it
anymore, I can't take it anymore

04:18.206 --> 04:27.866
 Just like it's going to be tied
someday... ahh

04:54.586 --> 04:56.446

04:57.766 --> 04:59.806
 She is so cute

05:00.226 --> 05:03.846
 She is so cute

05:07.408 --> 05:11.408
 I can't sleep anymore, I can't hold it
in

05:13.408 --> 05:15.408
 You're suddenly showing up

05:16.408 --> 05:18.408
 This is the north wind

05:19.408 --> 05:21.408
 This is the south wind

05:22.408 --> 05:24.408
 I don't know, it's random

05:24.408 --> 05:30.408
 Please subscribe to my channel!

05:31.226 --> 05:33.226
 I look strong.

05:33.226 --> 05:35.226
 I thought so.

05:37.226 --> 05:40.226
 I look like a space suit.

05:40.226 --> 05:45.226
 This is not a space suit.

05:46.232 --> 05:50.232
 I asked her which one is the most
expensive one among the bench coats she
prepared.

05:50.232 --> 05:52.232
 She said this one.

05:52.232 --> 05:54.232
 So, I bought this one.

05:54.232 --> 05:57.232
 It seems that she said that she would
buy only this one in spring.

05:57.232 --> 05:59.232
 When she chooses one.

05:59.232 --> 06:01.232
 It looks like a reflector.

06:01.232 --> 06:03.232
 It's a reflector.

06:03.232 --> 06:05.232
 It makes me bright.

06:05.232 --> 06:07.232
 It's a self-reflector.

06:07.232 --> 06:09.232
 Self-reflector.

06:10.232 --> 06:12.232
 It's the best.

06:12.232 --> 06:14.232
 This is the best one.

06:14.232 --> 06:24.154
 One more time.

06:24.154 --> 06:26.114
 Covered in sunshine!

06:26.114 --> 06:28.114
 It's 1pm.

06:28.114 --> 06:30.114
 I'm fashionweek!

06:40.922 --> 06:42.922
 It's cute.

06:42.922 --> 06:44.922
 It's a vintage coat.

it in

08:11.194 --> 08:13.194
 I love you.

08:13.194 --> 08:15.194
 I love you.

08:15.194 --> 08:17.194
 I love you.

08:25.594 --> 08:28.754
 How many pairs oflished are there in
this corner?​

08:28.754 --> 08:32.334
 In the final phase, what's the action
units that use it?​

08:32.334 --> 08:34.694
 I wonder... what will happen?​

08:34.694 --> 08:34.746
 Thank you for watching!

08:34.746 --> 08:36.746
 I love you.

08:36.746 --> 08:38.746
 I love you.

08:59.834 --> 09:07.334
 Ah, I'm about to burst, I can't hold it
anymore

09:07.334 --> 09:10.834
 This is the most nervous I've ever been

09:10.834 --> 09:16.834
 I like you, I like you, I like you, I
like you

09:16.834 --> 09:25.658
 I like you, I like you, I like you, I
like you

09:25.658 --> 09:27.418
 That's awkward!

09:27.618 --> 09:30.818
 The flied fish enrolls in two pockets.

09:30.958 --> 09:32.858
 It looks useful.

09:33.598 --> 09:34.858
 It's different.

09:34.998 --> 09:36.458
 Wow.

09:36.898 --> 09:39.138
 It can store a bunch of exacts.

09:39.438 --> 09:45.038
 They're finding their places.

09:45.678 --> 09:48.378
 Ypurai suggests a place

09:48.618 --> 09:50.978
 they can train at.

09:51.118 --> 09:53.118
 That feels unstoppable

09:53.238 --> 09:54.578
 It works

09:54.578 --> 09:57.578
 I can't stop

09:58.972 --> 09:59.772
 E

10:00.032 --> 10:00.632
 E

10:00.992 --> 10:01.472
 E

10:02.072 --> 10:03.572
 I ate

10:05.632 --> 10:05.972
 E

10:06.932 --> 10:07.372
 E

10:08.372 --> 10:09.272
 E

10:09.272 --> 10:11.272
 Strange!

10:13.152 --> 10:15.152
 It's lunch break.

10:16.152 --> 10:18.152
 Lunch break.

10:21.152 --> 10:24.152
 I'm so hungry that I can't eat.

10:25.152 --> 10:29.152
 I heard that there is a lunch box, so I
ate it.

10:31.152 --> 10:33.152
 How many meals do you want to eat
today?

10:38.152 --> 10:39.152
 Two meals.

10:39.152 --> 10:41.152
 I ate a lot.

10:42.152 --> 10:44.152
 There is a small piece of meat.

10:45.152 --> 10:47.152
 I ate a small piece of meat.

10:48.152 --> 10:50.152
 I ate it normally.

10:51.152 --> 10:53.152
 I think I ate too much.

10:53.152 --> 10:56.152
 I thought it was in the car.

10:59.144 --> 11:01.144
 It's higher than before.

11:01.144 --> 11:02.144
 It's good.

11:05.144 --> 11:06.144
 I'm happy.

11:12.144 --> 11:17.144
 We finished the shooting of the music
video.

11:17.144 --> 11:19.144
 Great!

11:21.146 --> 11:23.146
 It's amazing.

11:23.146 --> 11:24.146
 It's a special day.

11:24.146 --> 11:26.146
 We're going to have a TV commercial.

love.

11:35.146 --> 11:38.146
 I'm so happy to be a happy commercial
director.

11:38.146 --> 11:39.146
 I'm so happy.

11:39.146 --> 11:45.146
 I think this commercial is always
watched by people who support us in the
countryside.

11:45.146 --> 11:49.146
 I hope this commercial will reach
everyone all over the country.

11:49.146 --> 11:54.146

decided who will arrive later, but…

12:22.450 --> 12:22.746
 Movie's being shot on a set Y then we
enthusiasm

12:22.746 --> 12:25.706
 Schedewed

12:37.706 --> 12:41.166
 My sister marginalized me because of a
scene shot done by a fan leader.

12:41.166 --> 12:43.166
 I'm scared!

12:43.166 --> 12:45.166
 I'm scared!

12:47.166 --> 12:49.166
 You are a lucky girl!

12:49.166 --> 12:51.166
 I'm scared!

 I'm sorry!

13:02.264 --> 13:04.264
 I'm sorry!

13:05.264 --> 13:07.264
 It doesn't hurt at all.

13:08.264 --> 13:09.264
 I'm fine.

13:10.264 --> 13:12.264
 I thought you were done.

13:14.264 --> 13:16.264

 I wonder why, when I smile, it's as if
the world is shining

13:51.578 --> 13:55.578
 I can turn my umbrella around and feel
better

13:55.578 --> 13:59.578
 If I don't, I can't walk

13:59.578 --> 14:02.578
 I'm sure someone is crying somewhere

14:02.578 --> 14:07.578
 I wonder if it's cold and wet from
somewhere again

14:07.578 --> 14:10.578
 I'm sure someone is crying somewhere

14:10.578 --> 14:16.578
 I want to share my feelings with you

14:16.578 --> 14:20.578
 There's still a view I don't know in
front of me

14:20.578 --> 14:25.578
 Look, let's go anywhere

14:27.056 --> 14:31.056
 Goodbye, goodbye, thank you for
yesterday

14:31.056 --> 14:35.056
 The city after the rain is colored

14:35.056 --> 14:39.056
 I'll draw a fragment of the future on
the canvas of my damaged heart

14:39.056 --> 14:45.056
 I'll guide you

14:59.610 --> 15:04.610
 Now I can say it, the reason for my
tears

15:04.610 --> 15:08.610
 When I'm lost, I remember it right away

15:08.610 --> 15:12.610
 Even if it rains, I'll smile

15:12.610 --> 15:16.610
 Look, let's go anywhere

15:16.610 --> 15:20.610
 Goodbye, goodbye, to me of yesterday

15:20.610 --> 15:24.610
 The city lights after the rain are
sparkling

15:24.610 --> 15:28.610
 My heart is like a sunny day, the rain
drops are ringing

15:28.610 --> 15:32.610
 I'll play the rainbow piano

15:32.610 --> 15:37.610
 Goodbye, goodbye, to me of yesterday

15:37.610 --> 15:41.610
 The city lights after the rain are
sparkling

15:41.610 --> 15:45.610
 My heart is like a sunny day, the rain
drops are ringing

15:45.610 --> 15:58.266
