An exciting school trip in Gero! 92nd period Delivered from Gero City, Gifu Prefecture, with the cooperation of Yukai Resort Gero Saichoraku! This time, the Daikoku Sakamoto pair started off loosely in the town of Gero. Gero Onsen is one of the three famous hot springs in Japan, but the other two are also famous.

Can Yuzuki-chan answer?

While strolling around the hot spring town, I found a spot with a nice view! When I was taking pictures, I saw a signboard with the words "Shirasagi no Yu". How do you read this? When I looked it up, I saw the building I just passed by! Whoa, is this flow a mystery? According to the staff at the shop, this is read as "Shirasagi no Yu".An injured white heron healed its leg by soaking in the hot springs of Gero. It came to be called "Shirasaginoyu". That's why there are paintings of white birds everywhere in the hot spring town!

I learned a little more about Gero Onsen!
