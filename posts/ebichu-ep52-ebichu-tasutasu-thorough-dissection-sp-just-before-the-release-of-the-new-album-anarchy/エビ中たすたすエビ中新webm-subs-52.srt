1
00:00:00,058 --> 00:00:04,058
It's started! Eri-chuu Tatsuta-su!

2
00:00:06,058 --> 00:00:10,058
Today, Yasumoto will be the second one.

3
00:00:18,058 --> 00:00:19,058
I can hear the voice.

4
00:00:19,058 --> 00:00:25,584
Can you put the headphones on?

5
00:00:25,584 --> 00:00:26,584
Yes, this is it.

6
00:00:26,584 --> 00:00:27,584
Ah, this is the one.

7
00:00:27,584 --> 00:00:28,584
Hello!

8
00:00:28,584 --> 00:00:29,584
Hello!

9
00:00:29,584 --> 00:00:30,584
You're still in front of me.

10
00:00:30,584 --> 00:00:31,584
At least change your voice.

11
00:00:32,584 --> 00:00:33,584
This is Hoshina.

12
00:00:33,584 --> 00:00:34,584
Kirari rari rari rari-n!

13
00:00:34,584 --> 00:00:37,584
Kirari rari rari rari-n!

14
00:00:37,584 --> 00:00:38,584
I'm not doing anything!

15
00:00:38,584 --> 00:00:39,584
Hoshina.

16
00:00:39,584 --> 00:00:40,584
What is this?

17
00:00:40,584 --> 00:00:41,584
It's okay, everyone.

18
00:00:41,584 --> 00:00:42,584
Come out already.

19
00:00:42,584 --> 00:00:43,584
Come out.

20
00:00:43,584 --> 00:00:44,584
Come out.

21
00:00:44,584 --> 00:00:45,584
Come out.

22
00:00:45,584 --> 00:00:46,584
Ah, you're going to show your face from
there, right?

23
00:00:46,584 --> 00:00:47,584
Ah, you're going to show your face from
there, right?

24
00:00:48,584 --> 00:00:50,584
What is this panel?

25
00:00:50,584 --> 00:00:51,584
This panel is

26
00:00:51,584 --> 00:00:56,584
a panel that was used in the album's
normal jacket photos.

27
00:00:56,584 --> 00:00:58,584
It was used in the jacket photos.

28
00:00:58,584 --> 00:01:00,584
Ah, but the hair is beautiful.

29
00:01:00,584 --> 00:01:01,584
The hair is very good.

30
00:01:01,584 --> 00:01:02,584
The hair is very good.

31
00:01:02,584 --> 00:01:04,584
Because this is very

32
00:01:04,584 --> 00:01:06,584
It was pointed out in various ways.

33
00:01:06,584 --> 00:01:07,584
This is difficult, certainly.

34
00:01:07,584 --> 00:01:09,584
You can't see it from the back.

35
00:01:09,584 --> 00:01:11,584
Because the back is very convenient.

36
00:01:11,584 --> 00:01:12,584
You can't see anything.

37
00:01:12,584 --> 00:01:15,584
The picture from behind is amazing.

38
00:01:16,584 --> 00:01:18,584
What is this today?

39
00:01:18,584 --> 00:01:20,584
Yes, today

40
00:01:20,584 --> 00:01:21,584
Ah, I did it.

41
00:01:21,584 --> 00:01:22,584
Ah, it's coming out already.

42
00:01:22,584 --> 00:01:24,584
Do you just take it off normally?

43
00:01:24,584 --> 00:01:25,584
What? What?

44
00:01:25,584 --> 00:01:26,584
What's wrong? What's wrong?

45
00:01:26,584 --> 00:01:28,584
Today, until the album is released,

46
00:01:28,584 --> 00:01:30,584
6 days and

47
00:01:30,584 --> 00:01:34,584
23 hours and 56 minutes and 15 seconds.

48
00:01:34,584 --> 00:01:36,584
No, no, the countdown is fast.

49
00:01:36,584 --> 00:01:37,584
This is just right.

50
00:01:37,584 --> 00:01:38,584
This will change more and more.

51
00:01:38,584 --> 00:01:40,584
Because it's not a live broadcast.

52
00:01:40,584 --> 00:01:41,584
Because it's not a live broadcast.

53
00:01:41,584 --> 00:01:42,584
That's the way it is now.

54
00:01:42,584 --> 00:01:43,584
So,

55
00:01:43,584 --> 00:01:47,584
I'm going to talk about the album
release that's coming up next week.

56
00:01:47,584 --> 00:01:48,584
I want to talk about the album.

57
00:01:48,584 --> 00:01:49,584
Raise your hand if you want to talk
about the album.

58
00:01:49,584 --> 00:01:50,584
Raise your hand.

59
00:01:51,584 --> 00:01:52,584
Oh, just the lyrics.

60
00:01:55,584 --> 00:01:57,584
So, today,

61
00:01:57,584 --> 00:01:59,024
The pre-order of the album.

62
00:01:59,024 --> 00:02:01,024
I would like to dig into it.

63
00:02:01,024 --> 00:02:02,024
That's right.

64
00:02:02,024 --> 00:02:04,024
This time is a special edition.

65
00:02:04,024 --> 00:02:06,024
3rd new album of Erichu.

66
00:02:06,024 --> 00:02:22,202
Anarchy, Great Liberation Special.

67
00:02:22,202 --> 00:02:24,202
I'm crazy about you

68
00:02:24,202 --> 00:02:28,202
What should I do with my heart?

69
00:02:29,202 --> 00:02:33,202
Moratorium

70
00:02:34,202 --> 00:02:38,202
Add various things to your private Ebisu
junior high school

71
00:02:39,202 --> 00:02:43,202
Ebisu Justice

72
00:02:43,202 --> 00:02:49,202
This program is provided by the sponsor
you are watching.

73
00:02:59,386 --> 00:03:02,386
So, next week...

74
00:03:02,386 --> 00:03:03,386
Next week...

75
00:03:03,386 --> 00:03:04,386
It's close

76
00:03:05,386 --> 00:03:07,386
You're not reading the kanji

77
00:03:07,386 --> 00:03:10,386
Next week, we'll release the album

78
00:03:10,386 --> 00:03:12,386
You can read the first part

79
00:03:12,386 --> 00:03:20,256
We'll be releasing the album!

80
00:03:20,256 --> 00:03:23,256
MC Yasumoto and Ebichu alone are making
me nervous.

81
00:03:23,256 --> 00:03:25,256
Just like what you saw just now.

82
00:03:25,256 --> 00:03:30,256
We have invited this person who is
involved in the production.

83
00:03:30,256 --> 00:03:32,256
Thank you for coming!

84
00:03:33,256 --> 00:03:35,256
This is the sound director, Seto-san.

85
00:03:35,256 --> 00:03:37,256
Thank you for coming!

86
00:03:38,256 --> 00:03:43,256
Seto-san has been producing sound since
the debut single of Ebichu.

87
00:03:43,256 --> 00:03:47,256
He will be introducing the album with
Ebichu.

88
00:03:47,256 --> 00:03:49,256
Are you nervous just with Ebichu?

89
00:03:49,256 --> 00:03:53,256
I don't think I can give you any wrong
information.

90
00:03:53,256 --> 00:03:55,256
You can't give wrong information, right?

91
00:03:55,256 --> 00:03:57,256
You can't give any good information.

92
00:03:58,256 --> 00:04:02,256
First, we will be introducing the
Anarchy Jacket.

93
00:04:02,256 --> 00:04:10,864
This time, we will be releasing the
limited edition A and B and the regular
edition of the 3 types.

94
00:04:10,864 --> 00:04:13,864
I've been curious about this for a long
time.

95
00:04:13,864 --> 00:04:16,864
You're wearing the crown of your head.
What is this?

96
00:04:16,864 --> 00:04:18,864
It's a celestial bird.

97
00:04:18,864 --> 00:04:20,864
It's a celestial bird.

98
00:04:20,864 --> 00:04:22,864
You don't know?

99
00:04:22,864 --> 00:04:25,864
It's not something you can carry around.

100
00:04:25,864 --> 00:04:27,864
You can hold it like this.

101
00:04:27,864 --> 00:04:29,864
You're so mean!

102
00:04:29,864 --> 00:04:32,864
I'm taking it from Seto-san.

103
00:04:34,864 --> 00:04:36,864
You're only a friend of Seto-san.

104
00:04:36,864 --> 00:04:38,864
I'm really thankful.

105
00:04:38,864 --> 00:04:40,864
Why is it a celestial bird?

106
00:04:40,864 --> 00:04:42,864
Because it's a hole tree.

107
00:04:42,864 --> 00:04:44,864
Because it's a hole tree.

108
00:04:44,864 --> 00:04:46,864
Because it has holes.

109
00:04:46,864 --> 00:04:48,864
I see.

110
00:04:48,864 --> 00:04:50,864
How do you take this?

111
00:04:50,864 --> 00:04:52,864
Trampoline!

112
00:04:52,864 --> 00:04:55,864
Why is your pronunciation so good?

113
00:04:55,864 --> 00:04:57,864
Trampoline!

114
00:04:58,864 --> 00:05:03,864
A limited edition A jacket photo created
a sense of movement using trampoline.

115
00:05:03,864 --> 00:05:06,176
I picked up a还 from that photo booth.

116
00:05:06,176 --> 00:05:12,176
When I was little, I used to play with
trampolines.

117
00:05:13,176 --> 00:05:15,176
When I was shooting, I flew really high.

118
00:05:15,176 --> 00:05:18,176
I was really angry when I flew.

119
00:05:19,176 --> 00:05:20,176
Why?

120
00:05:20,176 --> 00:05:21,176
Because you were stuck?

121
00:05:21,176 --> 00:05:24,176
Yes, I was stuck and it was hard to hit
the light.

122
00:05:25,176 --> 00:05:26,176
You flew that high?

123
00:05:26,176 --> 00:05:28,176
I flew a lot.

124
00:05:28,176 --> 00:05:33,176
When you put a blanket on the ceiling,
you were like a fly.

125
00:05:33,176 --> 00:05:36,176
I was like a fly.

126
00:05:38,176 --> 00:05:40,176
You were like a fly.

127
00:05:40,176 --> 00:05:42,176
You played trampoline, right?

128
00:05:42,176 --> 00:05:46,176
Yes, I played with the machine.

129
00:05:46,176 --> 00:05:48,176
Did you really play with the machine?

130
00:05:49,176 --> 00:05:50,176
Yes, I did.

131
00:05:53,176 --> 00:05:55,176
You didn't know anything.

132
00:05:55,176 --> 00:05:57,176
I didn't know.

133
00:05:57,176 --> 00:06:03,120
The recording of the song will begin.

134
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:10,120
Let's see the contents. All 16 songs are
recorded in the new album アナーキー.

135
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:15,120
There are 16 songs.

136
00:06:16,120 --> 00:06:17,120
There are many.

137
00:06:18,120 --> 00:06:23,120
Takuya-san, please read each song.

138
00:06:24,120 --> 00:06:26,120
Please read correctly.

139
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:30,120
It's easy. It's not interesting, but
I'll do it.

140
00:06:30,120 --> 00:06:32,120
I want to fill the blank.

141
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:34,120
Amazing!

142
00:06:36,120 --> 00:06:37,120
I'm making fun of you, right?

143
00:06:38,120 --> 00:06:39,120
I can read it.

144
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:41,120
絶対アナーキー.

145
00:06:42,120 --> 00:06:43,120
I want to make fun of you.

146
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:46,120
This is a song made by Kaiki-san.

147
00:06:46,120 --> 00:06:48,120
春休みモラトリアム中学生.

148
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:52,120
ポップコントーン.

149
00:06:56,120 --> 00:06:57,120
Next.

150
00:06:57,120 --> 00:06:59,120
What is this?

151
00:07:03,312 --> 00:07:05,312
Just like you think

152
00:07:05,312 --> 00:07:06,312
Anything is fine

153
00:07:06,312 --> 00:07:10,312
I think it's anarchy

154
00:07:11,312 --> 00:07:13,312
Omoppa

155
00:07:14,312 --> 00:07:15,312
Omoppa?

156
00:07:16,312 --> 00:07:17,312
No

157
00:07:17,312 --> 00:07:19,312
I can't read this

158
00:07:19,312 --> 00:07:24,784
I'm a juice can and a cotton swab

159
00:07:24,784 --> 00:07:28,784
This is close. Not a cotton swab

160
00:07:30,784 --> 00:07:32,784
A mole

161
00:07:33,784 --> 00:07:34,784
Close!

162
00:07:34,784 --> 00:07:36,784
It's hard

163
00:07:36,784 --> 00:07:39,784
I don't like it. It hurts

164
00:07:39,784 --> 00:07:41,784
A ghost

165
00:07:41,784 --> 00:07:43,784
I don't like it

166
00:07:43,784 --> 00:07:45,784
A ghost

167
00:07:45,784 --> 00:07:47,784
It's common in our time

168
00:07:47,784 --> 00:07:49,784
Ah!

169
00:07:49,784 --> 00:07:50,784
I see

170
00:07:50,784 --> 00:07:51,784
Together

171
00:07:51,784 --> 00:07:52,784
1,2

172
00:07:52,784 --> 00:07:54,784
A pimple

173
00:07:56,784 --> 00:07:59,784
You got it right

174
00:07:59,784 --> 00:08:03,784
Let's listen to the songs of each member

175
00:08:03,784 --> 00:08:07,784
From the songs that are full of energy

176
00:08:07,784 --> 00:08:12,464
Please listen while imagining the song

177
00:08:12,464 --> 00:08:15,464
First, Mayama

178
00:08:15,464 --> 00:08:18,464
This is my recommended song

179
00:08:18,464 --> 00:08:20,464
Please Jesus

180
00:08:20,464 --> 00:08:22,464
What kind of song is this?

181
00:08:22,464 --> 00:08:30,464
This is a song that everyone thought
once

182
00:08:30,464 --> 00:08:35,464
It's a song that looks painful just by
looking at the lyrics

183
00:08:35,464 --> 00:08:46,464
But when you listen to the song, you can
feel warm and happy. I want to listen to
this song after I grow up

184
00:08:46,464 --> 00:08:50,464
So you can listen to it later and it
will come to you?

185
00:08:50,464 --> 00:08:58,464
I'm still 19 years old, so I think
adults will think that young people
don't understand

186
00:08:58,464 --> 00:09:04,464
But it's a song that came to me and I
cried in the train

187
00:09:04,464 --> 00:09:06,464
I cried

188
00:09:06,464 --> 00:09:15,464
So I think that if adults listen to it,
they will think more about it

189
00:09:15,464 --> 00:09:17,464
I want to hear

190
00:09:17,464 --> 00:09:21,464
Next is Yasumoto's recommended song

191
00:09:21,464 --> 00:09:23,464
I'm Ren

192
00:09:23,464 --> 00:09:27,464
The fourth is Popcorn tone

193
00:09:27,464 --> 00:09:29,464
What kind of song is this?

194
00:09:29,464 --> 00:09:35,464
This is a song that makes you feel like
popcorn

195
00:09:35,464 --> 00:09:45,464
I don't know if it's a love song or a
friend's story

196
00:09:45,464 --> 00:09:54,464
It's a song that expresses a girl's sad
feelings and wants to move forward

197
00:09:54,464 --> 00:09:57,464
The sound is cool

198
00:09:57,464 --> 00:09:59,464
Is it a bright song?

199
00:09:59,464 --> 00:10:07,464
It's a song that feels like a song, but
the lyrics are a little sad and cute

200
00:10:07,464 --> 00:10:11,744
Next is Hirota's recommended song

201
00:10:11,744 --> 00:10:13,744
Next is Hirota's recommended song

202
00:10:14,744 --> 00:10:19,744
My recommended song is Zettai Anarchy

203
00:10:19,744 --> 00:10:26,744
When I heard this song, I was so stupid

204
00:10:26,744 --> 00:10:33,744
So I thought I was very normal

205
00:10:33,744 --> 00:10:39,744
It's a song that teaches me that I can
be more free

206
00:10:39,744 --> 00:10:44,744
It's a perfect song to take me to the
world of Ebichu

207
00:10:44,744 --> 00:10:46,744
So I like it the most

208
00:10:48,744 --> 00:10:50,744
Zettai, how was the present?

209
00:10:50,744 --> 00:10:52,744
300 points

210
00:10:55,744 --> 00:10:58,744
Hirota, this is Zettai Anarchy

211
00:10:58,744 --> 00:11:00,744
Do you remember who made it?

212
00:11:00,744 --> 00:11:02,744
Unicorn's Abe-don

213
00:11:02,744 --> 00:11:05,744
Abe-don made it

214
00:11:05,744 --> 00:11:10,744
We have a message from Abe-don

215
00:11:10,744 --> 00:11:12,744
I'm so excited

216
00:11:12,744 --> 00:11:19,744
Abe-don has already released a song
called Zettai Anarchy

217
00:11:19,744 --> 00:11:27,744
He has released many hit songs as the
leader of the legendary band Unicorn

218
00:11:27,744 --> 00:11:33,562
What a surprise! The members got a
message

219
00:11:33,562 --> 00:11:35,280
Thank you.

220
00:11:35,280 --> 00:11:37,280
I'm Don Abe.

221
00:11:37,280 --> 00:11:42,280
Thank you for your hard work on the song
of Zette Anarchy.

222
00:11:42,280 --> 00:11:51,280
I hope you can play with this song.

223
00:11:51,280 --> 00:11:54,280
I'll make it again if it breaks down.

224
00:11:54,280 --> 00:11:57,280
Please play freely.

225
00:11:57,280 --> 00:12:12,026
Let's do our best and play together
again.

226
00:12:12,026 --> 00:12:14,026
I'm glad to hear that.

227
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:18,480
We are also from the Unicorn generation.

228
00:12:19,480 --> 00:12:22,480
We want to play the song.

229
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:26,480
We want to play together.

230
00:12:27,480 --> 00:12:30,480
Next is the song of the Oshi-na.

231
00:12:31,480 --> 00:12:36,480
I am the third song of the last song.

232
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:38,480
What kind of song is this?

233
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:46,480
The atmosphere of the song is completely
different.

234
00:12:47,480 --> 00:12:52,480
Just listening to the song makes me feel
good.

235
00:12:53,480 --> 00:12:55,480
Especially, I like the song A-melody.

236
00:12:56,480 --> 00:12:59,480
I feel like I'm in the water.

237
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:01,480
You feel like you're in the water?

238
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:03,480
I feel like I'm really vibrating.

239
00:13:03,480 --> 00:13:04,480
Your voice?

240
00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:05,480
Yes, my voice is like this.

241
00:13:05,480 --> 00:13:13,480
When I recorded the song, I thought of
Wakame in the deep sea.

242
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:16,480
I thought it was Kurione.

243
00:13:17,480 --> 00:13:18,480
It was a shiwakame.

244
00:13:19,480 --> 00:13:21,480
I thought it was a shiwakame.

245
00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:26,480
It's a strange atmosphere.

246
00:13:27,480 --> 00:13:29,480
The chorus is powerful.

247
00:13:29,480 --> 00:13:36,480
Mayamada-san made the song. He is the
one who has been with us since the first
song.

248
00:13:37,480 --> 00:13:39,480
He is the one who supports us.

249
00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:42,480
The chorus is powerful.

250
00:13:43,480 --> 00:13:44,480
I see.

251
00:13:45,480 --> 00:13:49,480
After this, Matsuno talks too much.

252
00:13:49,480 --> 00:13:52,704
Matsuno-san is a good person.

253
00:13:52,704 --> 00:14:00,704
To celebrate the release of the new
album, Anarchy, the members will explain
their favorite songs.

254
00:14:03,704 --> 00:14:05,704
What is Matsuno's favorite song?

255
00:14:07,704 --> 00:14:08,704
Please come in.

256
00:14:09,704 --> 00:14:10,704
Oh, it's the All-Powerful Runner.

257
00:14:11,704 --> 00:14:12,704
I love this song.

258
00:14:12,704 --> 00:14:13,704
Oh, really?

259
00:14:13,704 --> 00:14:14,704
What kind of song is this?

260
00:14:14,704 --> 00:14:16,704
It's a song about a girl's one-sided
love.

261
00:14:16,704 --> 00:14:17,704
It's a song about a girl's one-sided
love.

262
00:14:17,704 --> 00:14:18,704
It's a song about a girl's one-sided
love.

263
00:14:18,704 --> 00:14:19,704
It's a song about a girl's one-sided
love.

264
00:14:19,704 --> 00:14:20,704
It's a song about a girl's one-sided
love.

265
00:14:20,704 --> 00:14:22,704
It's a song about a girl's one-sided
love.

266
00:14:22,704 --> 00:14:25,704
Matsuno talks so much about Ryucho.

267
00:14:25,704 --> 00:14:26,704
You like him.

268
00:14:26,704 --> 00:14:27,704
I love him.

269
00:14:27,704 --> 00:14:29,704
I have a favorite song.

270
00:14:30,704 --> 00:14:31,704
It's number 2.

271
00:14:31,704 --> 00:14:33,704
Don't say it's bad.

272
00:14:34,704 --> 00:14:35,704
I'm trying my best.

273
00:14:35,704 --> 00:14:37,704
You're trying your best.

274
00:14:37,704 --> 00:14:40,704
But now you're saying you like him.

275
00:14:40,704 --> 00:14:41,704
That's good.

276
00:14:41,704 --> 00:14:42,704
Thank you.

277
00:14:42,704 --> 00:14:43,704
I'll do it.

278
00:14:43,704 --> 00:14:45,704
What kind of song is number 2?

279
00:14:45,704 --> 00:14:58,704
It's a song about a girl's one-sided
love.

280
00:14:58,704 --> 00:14:59,704
It's a long song.

281
00:14:59,704 --> 00:15:02,704
I was going to sing it, but it's too
long.

282
00:15:02,704 --> 00:15:03,704
Please sing it.

283
00:15:03,704 --> 00:15:04,704
I like this part.

284
00:15:04,704 --> 00:15:05,704
That part?

285
00:15:05,704 --> 00:15:06,704
Yes.

286
00:15:06,704 --> 00:15:10,704
If I buy milk tea at a vending machine,
I can't buy it as a treasure.

287
00:15:10,704 --> 00:15:11,704
You can't.

288
00:15:11,704 --> 00:15:16,704
But if you buy it, I can't buy it as a
treasure.

289
00:15:16,704 --> 00:15:17,704
That's cute.

290
00:15:17,704 --> 00:15:20,704
You're going to leave it in your room
without drinking it, right?

291
00:15:20,704 --> 00:15:22,704
I don't know.

292
00:15:22,704 --> 00:15:26,704
I'm not saying anything weird.

293
00:15:27,704 --> 00:15:29,704
That's not what I'm saying.

294
00:15:29,704 --> 00:15:33,704
You're going to keep it in your room
even if you drink it.

295
00:15:33,704 --> 00:15:34,704
It's a good lyrics.

296
00:15:34,704 --> 00:15:35,704
It's cute.

297
00:15:35,704 --> 00:15:36,704
It's cute.

298
00:15:36,704 --> 00:15:37,704
It's really cute.

299
00:15:37,704 --> 00:15:42,704
I'm glad I could tell that you really
like this song.

300
00:15:42,704 --> 00:15:49,704
We're about halfway through, but we
haven't heard any of your songs yet.

301
00:15:49,704 --> 00:15:50,704
That's a weird story.

302
00:15:50,704 --> 00:15:54,704
Everyone was waiting for you to
graduate.

303
00:15:54,704 --> 00:15:57,704
Everyone's making a face that they can't
say anything.

304
00:15:59,704 --> 00:16:05,704
Heer's 5th generation member, Kai-ki,
was a member of the rock band.

305
00:16:05,704 --> 00:16:08,704
The song that started the show,

306
00:16:08,704 --> 00:16:13,704
It's also in the album of the spring
vacation moratorium junior high school
students.

307
00:16:14,704 --> 00:16:16,704
But we're halfway through.

308
00:16:16,704 --> 00:16:18,704
I think so.

309
00:16:18,704 --> 00:16:21,704
I think this is the song for everyone.

310
00:16:21,704 --> 00:16:22,704
Three cards.

311
00:16:22,704 --> 00:16:23,704
Three cards.

312
00:16:23,704 --> 00:16:24,704
I see.

313
00:16:24,704 --> 00:16:28,704
What is the song that Kashiwagi likes?

314
00:16:28,704 --> 00:16:29,704
Let's go.

315
00:16:29,704 --> 00:16:30,704
Next, Kashiwagi.

316
00:16:30,704 --> 00:16:31,704
Yes.

317
00:16:31,704 --> 00:16:32,704
Right?

318
00:16:32,704 --> 00:16:33,704
Yes.

319
00:16:33,704 --> 00:16:34,704
Let's go.

320
00:16:34,704 --> 00:16:37,704
The 9th mission survival.

321
00:16:37,704 --> 00:16:40,704
I'm sorry. I didn't say anything about
the song.

322
00:16:41,704 --> 00:16:42,704
This is a great song.

323
00:16:42,704 --> 00:16:43,704
It's a great song.

324
00:16:43,704 --> 00:16:44,704
What kind of song is this?

325
00:16:44,704 --> 00:16:47,704
It's like a festival.

326
00:16:47,704 --> 00:16:50,704
I'm very excited.

327
00:16:50,704 --> 00:16:51,704
What kind of song is this?

328
00:16:51,704 --> 00:16:57,704
The sound is cool, but the lyrics are a
little messy.

329
00:16:57,704 --> 00:17:01,704
The title doesn't feel like a festival,
but it's like a festival.

330
00:17:01,704 --> 00:17:03,704
It's a festival inside.

331
00:17:03,704 --> 00:17:06,704
Oh, so the song title doesn't feel like
a festival?

332
00:17:06,704 --> 00:17:08,704
It's like a young festival.

333
00:17:08,704 --> 00:17:10,704
It's like a popping sound.

334
00:17:10,704 --> 00:17:11,704
It's like a young festival.

335
00:17:11,704 --> 00:17:12,704
Paripi.

336
00:17:12,704 --> 00:17:13,704
It's a party.

337
00:17:13,704 --> 00:17:17,704
It's a party night.

338
00:17:17,704 --> 00:17:18,704
I see.

339
00:17:18,704 --> 00:17:19,704
That kind of thing.

340
00:17:19,704 --> 00:17:21,704
I'm looking forward to it.

341
00:17:21,704 --> 00:17:22,704
I see.

342
00:17:23,704 --> 00:17:26,704
Next, what is the favorite song of
Kobayashi?

343
00:17:27,704 --> 00:17:29,704
My favorite song is...

344
00:17:29,704 --> 00:17:30,704
Ta-da!

345
00:17:30,704 --> 00:17:31,704
It's a pimple.

346
00:17:31,704 --> 00:17:32,704
It's a pimple.

347
00:17:32,704 --> 00:17:33,704
It's not a pimple.

348
00:17:33,704 --> 00:17:36,704
I was curious about this song called
pimple.

349
00:17:37,704 --> 00:17:39,704
I couldn't read this title.

350
00:17:39,704 --> 00:17:42,704
I can't imagine what kind of song it is.

351
00:17:43,704 --> 00:17:45,704
According to Kobayashi's explanation,

352
00:17:45,704 --> 00:17:48,704
The song title is...

353
00:17:48,704 --> 00:17:51,704
I think the mother generation is
nostalgic.

354
00:17:51,704 --> 00:17:52,704
Nostalgic?

355
00:17:52,704 --> 00:17:53,704
Is it a song like that?

356
00:17:53,704 --> 00:17:56,704
What kind of story is it?

357
00:17:56,704 --> 00:18:00,704
There's a girl and a boy.

358
00:18:00,704 --> 00:18:05,704
That girl has a pimple.

359
00:18:05,704 --> 00:18:08,704
If the pimple heals, will you go on a
date with me?

360
00:18:08,704 --> 00:18:10,704
I asked him.

361
00:18:10,704 --> 00:18:13,704
You don't have to heal your pimples.

362
00:18:13,704 --> 00:18:15,704
That's not what girls do.

363
00:18:15,704 --> 00:18:16,704
Girls don't have pimples.

364
00:18:16,704 --> 00:18:19,704
You can be more confident with girls.

365
00:18:19,704 --> 00:18:22,000
I don't have pimples.

366
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:23,008
What are you talking about?

367
00:18:23,008 --> 00:18:24,008
I don't know what you mean.

368
00:18:24,008 --> 00:18:25,008
Wait a minute.

369
00:18:26,008 --> 00:18:28,008
I have a pimple in my puberty.

370
00:18:28,008 --> 00:18:31,008
I want to feel the moment of a girl.

371
00:18:31,008 --> 00:18:34,008
I want to feel a different feeling when
I grow up.

372
00:18:34,008 --> 00:18:48,168
You want to be a

373
00:18:48,168 --> 00:18:53,168
I see.

374
00:18:53,168 --> 00:18:54,168
I see.

375
00:18:54,168 --> 00:18:55,168
I see.

376
00:18:55,168 --> 00:18:57,168
I really understood.

377
00:18:57,168 --> 00:19:00,168
And the last one is Nakayama.

378
00:19:00,168 --> 00:19:02,168
What is the favorite song?

379
00:19:03,168 --> 00:19:07,168
Please tell us what song Nakayama chose.

380
00:19:07,168 --> 00:19:13,248
I'm very curious.

381
00:19:13,248 --> 00:19:14,648
Finally it's out!

382
00:19:14,648 --> 00:19:16,648
Kaeki-san, I'm glad you watched till the
end!

383
00:19:16,648 --> 00:19:17,648
Yay!

384
00:19:17,648 --> 00:19:18,648
I'm watching!

385
00:19:18,648 --> 00:19:19,648
But this is a bit...

386
00:19:19,648 --> 00:19:22,648
It's a bit forced, isn't it?

387
00:19:22,648 --> 00:19:23,648
That's right.

388
00:19:23,648 --> 00:19:25,648
Didn't the staff tell you to write it?

389
00:19:25,648 --> 00:19:26,648
Right, Nakayama?

390
00:19:26,648 --> 00:19:27,648
Eh?

391
00:19:27,648 --> 00:19:28,648
Really?

392
00:19:28,648 --> 00:19:29,648
Really? I wrote it.

393
00:19:29,648 --> 00:19:30,648
Really?

394
00:19:30,648 --> 00:19:31,648
I wrote it.

395
00:19:31,648 --> 00:19:32,648
Nakayama, really?

396
00:19:32,648 --> 00:19:34,648
I wrote it in the second one.

397
00:19:36,648 --> 00:19:37,648
That's too bad.

398
00:19:37,648 --> 00:19:38,648
No, no.

399
00:19:38,648 --> 00:19:40,648
Everyone wrote it in the second one.

400
00:19:40,648 --> 00:19:41,648
Yes.

401
00:19:41,648 --> 00:19:42,648
I see.

402
00:19:42,648 --> 00:19:43,648
Everyone wrote it in the second one.

403
00:19:43,648 --> 00:19:44,648
That's too bad.

404
00:19:44,648 --> 00:19:45,648
Everyone's favorite song.

405
00:19:45,648 --> 00:19:46,648
I see.

406
00:19:46,648 --> 00:19:48,648
Everyone's best 2 is amazing.

407
00:19:48,648 --> 00:19:49,648
It's amazing.

408
00:19:49,648 --> 00:19:52,648
It's obvious that everyone likes it.

409
00:19:52,648 --> 00:19:53,648
I see.

410
00:19:54,648 --> 00:19:57,648
Nakayama-san, why did you write this?

411
00:19:57,648 --> 00:19:58,648
Ogata-san...

412
00:19:58,648 --> 00:20:01,648
Ogata Kaeki-san wrote it.

413
00:20:02,648 --> 00:20:03,648
Other than that?

414
00:20:04,648 --> 00:20:05,648
I didn't say anything.

415
00:20:05,648 --> 00:20:06,648
It's okay.

416
00:20:06,648 --> 00:20:07,648
It's correct.

417
00:20:07,648 --> 00:20:08,648
Other than that?

418
00:20:08,648 --> 00:20:09,648
Other than that?

419
00:20:09,648 --> 00:20:13,648
Among the songs I like,

420
00:20:13,648 --> 00:20:15,648
in the song...

421
00:20:15,648 --> 00:20:17,648
How do I say it?

422
00:20:17,648 --> 00:20:18,648
There's a guitar solo.

423
00:20:18,648 --> 00:20:20,648
I really like that part.

424
00:20:20,648 --> 00:20:22,648
Hia-san plays it.

425
00:20:22,648 --> 00:20:25,648
So, Nakayama-san.

426
00:20:25,648 --> 00:20:26,648
Yes.

427
00:20:26,648 --> 00:20:29,648
Who wrote the song for Moratorium Junior
High School?

428
00:20:29,648 --> 00:20:30,648
Ogata Kaeki-san.

429
00:20:30,648 --> 00:20:31,648
Yes.

430
00:20:31,648 --> 00:20:33,648
We have a message from this person.

431
00:20:33,648 --> 00:20:35,648
Oh, Kaeki-chan.

432
00:20:37,648 --> 00:20:39,648
Everyone watching Ebi-chuu Tatsuta-san.

433
00:20:39,648 --> 00:20:41,648
And everyone in Ebi-chuu.

434
00:20:41,648 --> 00:20:42,648
Two shooting stars.

435
00:20:42,648 --> 00:20:44,648
How are you?

436
00:20:44,648 --> 00:20:45,648
Miracle.

437
00:20:46,648 --> 00:20:47,648
Wait.

438
00:20:47,648 --> 00:20:48,648
It's not a miracle.

439
00:20:48,648 --> 00:20:49,648
It's not a miracle.

440
00:20:50,648 --> 00:20:52,648
I...

441
00:20:52,648 --> 00:20:54,648
wrote a song called

442
00:20:54,648 --> 00:20:56,648
Haruesei Moratorium Junior High School.

443
00:20:56,648 --> 00:20:59,648
This song is a rock-like feeling.

444
00:20:59,648 --> 00:21:03,648
The first part, the second part,

445
00:21:03,648 --> 00:21:05,648
using the tencho,

446
00:21:05,648 --> 00:21:08,648
and the beautiful melody line,

447
00:21:08,648 --> 00:21:11,648
I think we were able to express

448
00:21:11,648 --> 00:21:16,648
the core and catchy parts of Ebi-chuu
well.

449
00:21:16,648 --> 00:21:20,648
I'm looking forward to hearing it live
again.

450
00:21:20,648 --> 00:21:24,176
This has been Ogata Kaeki.

451
00:21:24,176 --> 00:21:31,176
This has been Ogata Kaeki.

452
00:21:31,194 --> 00:21:33,194
Asuna is amazing

453
00:21:33,194 --> 00:21:35,194
For now, I'm fine

454
00:21:35,194 --> 00:21:37,194
Kaiqi-san is fine

455
00:21:37,194 --> 00:21:39,194
That's interesting, Kaiqi-san

456
00:21:39,194 --> 00:21:43,392
Please give Kaiqi-san my message

457
00:21:43,392 --> 00:21:53,392
Ogata-san, I'm waiting for the day when
I can play with Hiei-san and Ebichu
during the live show

458
00:21:53,392 --> 00:21:57,392
I'm waiting for the day when I can play
with Hiei-san and Ebichu during the live
show

459
00:21:57,392 --> 00:21:59,392
Thank you

460
00:21:59,392 --> 00:22:00,392
Bye bye

461
00:22:00,392 --> 00:22:01,392
Thank you

462
00:22:04,392 --> 00:22:08,392
Lastly, let's see what kind of album the
new album is

463
00:22:08,392 --> 00:22:12,392
Let's ask the sound director Seto-san to
tell us

464
00:22:12,392 --> 00:22:21,392
As the title says, it's an album with
various artists and writers

465
00:22:21,392 --> 00:22:25,392
The album has a variety of sounds

466
00:22:25,392 --> 00:22:27,392
That's what it sounds like

467
00:22:27,392 --> 00:22:29,392
I'm sorry, I just heard Matsuno's
stomach rumbling

468
00:22:29,392 --> 00:22:31,968
I'm sorry

469
00:22:31,968 --> 00:22:33,968
I didn't hear it either

470
00:22:33,968 --> 00:22:35,968
It was quite anarchy

471
00:22:40,968 --> 00:22:45,968
Finally, we will have the album's hit
period

472
00:22:45,968 --> 00:22:54,842
queuing while feeling flustered

473
00:22:54,842 --> 00:22:56,842
This is the first time I do this

474
00:22:56,842 --> 00:22:57,842
This is amazing

475
00:22:57,842 --> 00:23:02,842
Since it's an anarchy, I would like to
make a hole here

476
00:23:02,842 --> 00:23:03,842
I see

477
00:23:03,842 --> 00:23:04,842
That sounds fun

478
00:23:04,842 --> 00:23:06,842
By the way, what is the purpose of this?

479
00:23:06,842 --> 00:23:08,842
To aim for the first place in the Oricon

480
00:23:08,842 --> 00:23:09,842
I see

481
00:23:11,842 --> 00:23:17,842
So, they will aim for the first place in
the anarchy and make a hole

482
00:23:18,842 --> 00:23:19,842
Let's go

483
00:23:19,842 --> 00:23:21,842
Aim for the first place in the Oricon

484
00:23:21,842 --> 00:23:24,842
Ready, set, go

485
00:23:24,842 --> 00:23:26,842
Wait a minute

486
00:23:26,842 --> 00:23:27,842
What is that?

487
00:23:27,842 --> 00:23:28,842
Wait a minute

488
00:23:28,842 --> 00:23:29,882
Wait a minute

489
00:23:29,882 --> 00:23:32,542
Wait, wait!

490
00:23:33,466 --> 00:23:34,466
There are so many chikuwa

491
00:23:34,466 --> 00:23:35,466
Wait, I want to eat the chikuwa

492
00:23:36,466 --> 00:23:39,466
There are cucumbers in the chikuwa

493
00:23:40,466 --> 00:23:41,466
Can I eat it?

494
00:23:42,466 --> 00:23:43,466
I'm hungry

495
00:23:44,466 --> 00:23:49,466
Let's make a wish and make a toast with
the first chikuwa

496
00:23:49,466 --> 00:23:53,466
Let's make a wish and make a toast with
chikuwa

497
00:23:55,466 --> 00:23:57,466
Cheers

498
00:23:59,466 --> 00:24:00,466
Amazing

499
00:24:00,466 --> 00:24:03,466
This is the first time we have made a
toast with chikuwa

500
00:24:03,466 --> 00:24:04,466
Delicious

501
00:24:05,466 --> 00:24:11,466
And the national tour starts on the 23rd
of this month

502
00:24:12,466 --> 00:24:19,466
And the Blu-ray of Saitama Super Arena
was released at the same time as the
album

503
00:24:19,466 --> 00:24:29,466
This time, we will show you the first TV
video of the tour

504
00:24:34,234 --> 00:24:38,394
I want to spend another day together

505
00:24:38,394 --> 00:24:42,634
I want to say goodbye

506
00:24:42,634 --> 00:24:49,616
It's still different

507
00:24:49,616 --> 00:24:51,616
Next time

508
00:24:51,616 --> 00:24:52,616
What is necessary for the shrimp stew
now?

509
00:24:52,616 --> 00:24:53,616
Training

510
00:24:53,616 --> 00:24:54,616
What?

511
00:24:54,616 --> 00:24:57,616
Every time the shrimp stew is trained

512
00:24:57,616 --> 00:25:01,616
For me, ramen is a moment of happiness

513
00:25:01,616 --> 00:25:14,916
In addition, the training of laughing
that opens the

514
00:25:14,916 --> 00:25:20,916
mouth is the most important thing

515
00:25:20,916 --> 00:25:21,916
I was waiting

516
00:25:21,916 --> 00:25:25,050
I was waiting

517
00:25:25,050 --> 00:25:28,050
I'm sure you'll say, too.

518
00:25:28,050 --> 00:25:32,003
I'm sure you'll say, too.
