00:53.898 --> 00:55.898
 What should I do?

00:56.688 --> 00:58.688
 I'm afraid of you.

00:58.688 --> 01:00.688
 You're a stretch man.

01:00.688 --> 01:02.688
 Do you know what a stretch man is?

01:02.688 --> 01:04.688

11:46.472 --> 11:52.472
 This is our second time coming to
Fukuoka for a one-man live.

11:53.472 --> 11:55.472
 This is our first time in Fukuoka.

11:56.472 --> 12:01.472
 We've never performed in a festival
before, so we're really happy to be
here.

12:01.472 --> 12:14.472
 It's our third day, but we're getting
better and better every time.

13:03.808 --> 13:05.808
 You look like Stella Roon.

13:06.808 --> 13:09.808
 I thought you looked like a bunny from
Disney.

13:10.808 --> 13:15.808
 But Stella Roon's hair style is not
like this.

13:16.808 --> 13:17.808
 I was worried about the reaction.

13:18.808 --> 13:19.808
 I thought you were just there.

13:20.808 --> 13:22.808
 No, you look like a bunny.

13:23.808 --> 13:24.808
 Are you a ballet dancer?

13:25.808 --> 13:26.808
 You're cute.

13:29.808 --> 13:30.808
 You're good at delivery.

13:30.808 --> 13:32.808
 Are you going to laugh?

13:33.808 --> 13:34.808
 Of course.

13:35.808 --> 13:37.808
 We're going to do a part of the dance.

13:38.808 --> 13:39.808
 Are you going to use that?

13:40.808 --> 13:43.808
 We're going to do a part of the dance.

13:44.808 --> 13:45.808
 I wrote it down.

13:46.808 --> 13:47.808
 It's a little faded.

13:48.808 --> 13:51.808
 I wrote down the title.

13:51.808 --> 14:03.808
 I'm happy to meet a lot of people.

14:04.808 --> 14:06.808
 It's the fourth time, but I'm already
halfway through.

14:06.808 --> 14:08.808
 I'm already halfway through.

14:19.808 --> 14:20.808
 You're moving a lot.

14:21.808 --> 14:22.808
 I was surprised.

14:23.808 --> 14:24.808
 It's fast.

14:25.808 --> 14:27.808
 I'm not nervous.

14:28.808 --> 14:29.808
 I relaxed in a good way.

14:30.808 --> 14:33.808
 I have to do it carefully.

14:33.808 --> 14:35.808
 I'm going to finish it in a flash.

14:36.808 --> 14:38.808
 Let's take care of it.

14:39.808 --> 14:40.808
 I'll do my best.

14:41.808 --> 14:44.808
 Let's do our best for a part of
Fukuoka.

14:46.808 --> 14:48.808
 It's over.

14:48.808 --> 14:52.250
 Thank you for watching.

14:52.250 --> 14:54.250
 It's Fukuoka!

14:55.250 --> 14:57.250
 How do you feel?

14:58.250 --> 15:00.250
 I feel like it's gone by so fast.

15:01.250 --> 15:03.250
 It's already the second half of the
year.

15:04.250 --> 15:06.250
 But I feel like it's been a while.

15:09.250 --> 15:11.250
 I feel like it's been three days.

15:13.250 --> 15:16.250
 It's my first time in Fukuoka since the
Super Toki Battle.

15:17.250 --> 15:20.250
 It's been a while since I came to
Fukuoka for the Toki Battle.

15:20.250 --> 15:24.250
 I'm sure there will be a lot of people
I haven't seen in a while.

15:24.250 --> 15:26.250
 I'm looking forward to it.

15:30.112 --> 15:33.312
 I climbed up the second floor of
Fukuoka station today.

15:33.312 --> 15:34.812
 I saw it.

15:34.812 --> 15:37.512
 Then the stage was closer than I
thought.

15:37.512 --> 15:42.012
 When I was on the platform, I could see
the people on the second floor.

15:42.012 --> 15:46.112
 I'm going to meet a lot of people on
the second floor today.

15:46.112 --> 15:47.312
 I'll do my best.

15:47.312 --> 15:50.112
 I'll do my best.

16:02.522 --> 16:04.522
 Be prepared.

16:04.522 --> 16:09.522
 I want to gather more distance.

16:09.522 --> 16:13.522
 I want to make you more absorbed.

16:13.522 --> 16:17.522
 Wherever you are,

16:17.522 --> 16:20.522
 I'll smile alone.

16:20.522 --> 16:21.522
 Cute.

16:21.522 --> 16:24.522
 Tell me your love.

16:24.522 --> 16:28.522
 I love you no matter how many times.

16:28.522 --> 16:31.522
 I want to look at you every day.

16:31.522 --> 16:34.522
 I need you anytime.

16:34.522 --> 16:37.522
 Don't talk to other girls.

16:37.522 --> 16:38.522
 OK?

16:38.522 --> 16:40.522
 I'm cute.

16:40.522 --> 16:45.408
 I see.

16:45.408 --> 16:47.408
 I'm going to be a prankster.

16:47.408 --> 16:49.408
 Don't look down on me.

16:49.408 --> 16:51.408
 I'm not looking down on you.

16:51.408 --> 16:53.408
 Don't look down on me.

16:53.408 --> 16:55.408
 I'm not looking down on you.

17:01.408 --> 17:03.408
 Don't look down on me.

17:03.408 --> 17:04.408
 I won't.

17:04.408 --> 17:07.408
 Can I be taken by someone else? Can I
be in a bad mood?

17:07.408 --> 17:09.408
 No.

 Here is the question.

18:04.464 --> 18:07.464
 Which one is hotter?

18:07.464 --> 18:11.464
 I think this is a sign that you are
excited.

18:12.464 --> 18:14.464
 Which one is hotter?

18:15.464 --> 18:17.464
 Thermography.

 Thermography is coming out.

18:19.464 --> 18:20.464
 I got it.

18:20.464 --> 18:22.464
 Which one is it?

 We would be happy if we could show you
how much we've grown.

37:30.712 --> 37:35.712
 We could feel that everyone's smiles
were fun.

37:35.712 --> 37:38.712
 We got more power from that.

37:38.712 --> 37:42.712
 We want to grow bigger and come back.

37:43.712 --> 37:46.712
 We can see the smiles even through the
mask.

37:46.712 --> 37:50.712
 Please smile a lot with your eyes.

37:50.712 --> 37:59.712
 Everyone's applause, hands, and
penlight made us happy.

yesterday

39:21.128 --> 39:25.128
 The city after the rain is so beautiful

39:25.128 --> 39:29.128
 I'll draw a piece of the future on the
canvas of my damaged heart

39:29.128 --> 39:47.128

 Look, let's go anywhere

40:06.226 --> 40:10.226
 Goodbye, goodbye, to me of yesterday

40:10.226 --> 40:14.226
 The city lights after the rain are
sparkling

40:14.226 --> 40:18.226
 My heart is like a sunny day, playing
the sound of rain drops

40:18.226 --> 40:22.226
 I'm playing the rainbow piano

40:22.226 --> 40:24.602

 I wear a rainbow dress
