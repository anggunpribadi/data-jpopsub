1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Yakan and idol!

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:08,000
That's it for the ending. Do you have
any news?

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:16,000
Yes, I do. On Sunday, October 23, 2022,
we will be performing at Sanrio
Puroland.

4
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
That's a dream country!

5
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:24,000
We will be performing with Cinnamon Roll
and Pocacko.

6
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:28,000
I think we will be able to see cute
Kurako.

7
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:32,000
We want to do a cute performance on this
stage.

8
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:36,000
Please come to our show.

9
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:42,000
And the Crown Pop Tour will start in
January.

10
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:47,000
We will be performing in January and
February.

11
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:49,000
And one more thing.

12
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:53,000
We will be releasing an album in this
winter.

13
00:00:53,000 --> 00:01:01,000
We will also be releasing a DVD of the
performance we just did.

14
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:04,000
That's great.

15
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:10,000
We want to hear more about Kurako.

16
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
I'm very interested.

17
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:13,000
Thank you.

18
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:17,000
I don't talk about myself much.

19
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:20,000
I'm a bit shy.

20
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
But we want to hear from you.

21
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
I want to talk to you.

22
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:30,000
That's it for Yakan and idol.

23
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:34,000
Today, we had Yakan, Kajuta, and Airi.

24
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
Bye bye. Thank you.

25
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Thank you.

26
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
The end.

27
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:45,000
In Tokyo, people ask if it's okay to
make a Tokyo branch.

28
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:48,000
But I'll say no.

29
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
You'll say no?

30
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:53,000
I'm not a good person.

31
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:56,000
I'm in the batting team.

32
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:59,000
I'm not like them.

33
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:03,000
I want to see Seta without the mitt.

34
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:10,000
I'm told I'm not like Seta.

35
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:20,000
Yakan and idol.
