00:00.000 --> 00:02.000
 Unexpected girl.

00:02.000 --> 00:04.000
 I got it.

00:06.000 --> 00:07.000
 It's funny.

00:07.000 --> 00:08.000
 I got it.

00:08.000 --> 00:13.818
 Please subscribe to my channel.

00:14.818 --> 00:17.818
 Good morning.

00:18.818 --> 00:19.818
 Today, we are going to play a game
called,

00:19.818 --> 00:22.818
 Kareta Queen, by Kareta.

00:22.818 --> 00:24.818
 Wow, that's right.

00:27.818 --> 00:29.818
 I think Kareta is a winter game.

00:30.818 --> 00:31.818
 It's winter now.

00:32.818 --> 00:33.818
 Oh, it's winter now.

00:34.818 --> 00:35.818
 Yes, it's winter now.

00:36.818 --> 00:37.818
 You are so bold.

00:37.818 --> 00:39.818
 I'm the first one to play.

00:40.818 --> 00:42.818
 I started playing Kareta from making my
own character.

00:43.818 --> 00:44.818
 That's fun.

00:44.818 --> 00:45.818
 You make your own character from paper?

00:46.818 --> 00:47.818
 Yes, I make my own character from
paper.

00:48.818 --> 00:49.818
 I'm so excited.

00:50.818 --> 00:51.818
 The content of Kareta is,

00:51.818 --> 00:57.818
 you make a character and a reading card
with the character you have in your
hand.

00:58.818 --> 00:59.818
 Then, you play Kareta.

01:00.818 --> 01:01.818
 That's fun.

01:01.818 --> 01:03.818
 There are 8 people today.

01:03.818 --> 01:06.818
 You will play Kareta with 4 people.

01:07.818 --> 01:10.818
 The winner will play Kareta with 4
people.

01:11.818 --> 01:12.818
 I see.

01:13.818 --> 01:16.818
 So, let's make a Kareta together.

01:17.818 --> 01:18.818
 Let's do it.

01:19.818 --> 01:20.818
 Let's make Kareta.

01:21.818 --> 01:22.818
 Okay.

01:24.818 --> 01:25.818
 That's funny.

01:26.818 --> 01:29.818
 So, let's make a Kareta.

01:29.818 --> 01:33.818
 You may not know many things about
Tohoku,

01:34.818 --> 01:37.818
 so I hope you enjoy reading Kareta.

01:39.818 --> 01:40.818
 Let's do it.

01:42.818 --> 01:45.818
 Red, yellow, blue, green, black,
yellow, red.

01:47.818 --> 01:48.818
 I thought of yellow.

01:53.818 --> 01:54.818
 It's fun.

01:54.818 --> 01:55.818
 Is it?

01:56.818 --> 01:57.818
 I only wrote Hiragana.

01:57.818 --> 01:58.818
 Let's do Kareta.

01:58.818 --> 01:59.818
 Kareta?

02:01.818 --> 02:02.818
 Yua is cute.

02:02.818 --> 02:08.704
 Please subscribe to this channel.

02:08.704 --> 02:10.704
 I'm not the first one.

02:10.704 --> 02:12.704
 I see.

02:12.704 --> 02:14.704
 I see.

02:14.704 --> 02:16.704
 You are cute.

02:16.704 --> 02:18.704
 I see.

02:18.704 --> 02:20.704
 I asked her if she was not the first
one.

02:20.704 --> 02:22.704
 She said she was not the first one.

02:22.704 --> 02:24.704
 I see.

02:24.704 --> 02:26.704
 If I find the first one,

02:26.704 --> 02:28.704
 I see.

02:28.704 --> 02:30.704
 I can find many cute girls,

02:30.704 --> 02:32.704
 but I can't find the second one.

02:32.704 --> 02:34.704
 I'm not the first one.

02:34.704 --> 02:36.704
 I see.

02:36.704 --> 02:38.704
 I see.

02:38.704 --> 02:40.704
 You are cute.

02:40.704 --> 02:42.704
 I see.

02:46.064 --> 02:49.064
 I have a lot of free time.

02:49.064 --> 02:51.064
 Free time!

02:52.064 --> 02:54.064
 That's funny.

02:54.064 --> 02:56.064
 Write it down.

02:56.064 --> 02:58.064
 That's crazy.

02:58.064 --> 03:00.064
 I have a lot of free time.

03:00.064 --> 03:01.064
 I'm sorry.

03:01.064 --> 03:03.064
 I'll tell you the truth.

03:04.064 --> 03:06.064
 That's crazy.

03:06.064 --> 03:10.064
 I have a lot of free time.

03:10.064 --> 03:12.064
 I don't have free time.

03:12.064 --> 03:15.064
 That's crazy.

03:16.304 --> 03:20.304
 There are things that can't be done
even if you tell me.

03:20.304 --> 03:22.304
 Because you're human.

03:22.304 --> 03:23.304
 I'm a human.

03:23.304 --> 03:24.304
 I'm a human.

03:24.304 --> 03:25.304
 I'm a human.

03:25.304 --> 03:26.304
 I'm a human.

03:27.304 --> 03:29.304
 It's funny.

03:30.304 --> 03:31.304
 It's good.

03:31.304 --> 03:32.304
 It's good.

03:32.304 --> 03:33.304
 It's funny.

03:33.304 --> 03:36.304
 We're done.

03:36.304 --> 03:37.304
 It's long.

03:37.304 --> 03:38.304
 We did it.

03:38.304 --> 03:42.304
 First, we'll divide it into four
people.

03:42.304 --> 03:46.304
 Let's divide it in the middle.

03:46.304 --> 03:51.304
 Let's start with the left team.

03:51.304 --> 03:52.304
 Yes.

03:53.904 --> 03:55.648
 Yay!

03:55.648 --> 04:00.648
 The first round, Iginari Touhoku-san's
usual karta.

04:00.648 --> 04:02.648
 Start!

04:03.648 --> 04:04.648
 I'll start.

04:05.648 --> 04:08.648
 She talks too much and is long.

04:10.648 --> 04:11.648
 That's fast.

04:14.648 --> 04:15.648
 I'll start.

04:16.648 --> 04:18.648
 She dances like a Souranbushi.

04:20.648 --> 04:21.648
 That's fast.

04:21.648 --> 04:22.648
 That's it!

04:22.648 --> 04:23.648
 Souranbushi!

04:24.648 --> 04:26.648
 I've never danced.

04:26.648 --> 04:27.648
 I'll start.

04:28.648 --> 04:31.648
 She's slow to decide the content of the
live.

04:34.648 --> 04:35.648
 That's amazing.

04:37.648 --> 04:39.648
 She's a bad talker.

04:40.648 --> 04:42.648
 She's a bad talker.

04:44.648 --> 04:46.648
 It's about us, so it's fine.

04:46.648 --> 04:47.648
 It's fun.

04:47.648 --> 04:49.648
 She's a bad talker.

04:49.648 --> 04:51.648
 She's a bad talker.

04:52.648 --> 04:53.648
 Don't say it.

04:55.648 --> 04:57.648
 That's funny.

04:58.648 --> 04:59.648
 She's a bad talker.

04:59.648 --> 05:00.648
 She's a bad talker.

05:01.648 --> 05:02.648
 I'll start.

05:03.648 --> 05:05.648
 She can't enter the store with 9
people.

05:07.648 --> 05:08.648
 That's wrong.

05:08.648 --> 05:12.720
 She's a bad talker.

05:13.720 --> 05:15.720
 It's a good opportunity!

05:16.720 --> 05:18.720
 I'm not good at this.

05:18.720 --> 05:20.720
 Don't worry. I'm not going to touch
you.

05:21.720 --> 05:24.720
 I was surprised that you were 3 years
older than me.

05:25.720 --> 05:27.720
 You're so passionate.

05:31.720 --> 05:32.720
 I'm going to do it.

05:33.720 --> 05:37.720
 I was a mother of a child.

05:38.720 --> 05:39.720
 I see.

05:39.720 --> 05:41.720
 Who wrote this?

05:42.720 --> 05:44.720
 What does this mean?

05:45.720 --> 05:48.720
 It's a personality of motherhood.

05:49.720 --> 05:52.720
 I can't do it even if I'm born.

05:52.720 --> 05:53.720
 Hinao

05:56.720 --> 05:57.720
 I got it.

06:00.720 --> 06:02.720
 I'm selling KUINI-ANMA.

06:03.720 --> 06:06.720
 I'm selling KUINI-ANMA.

06:06.720 --> 06:08.720
 I'm selling KUINI-ANMA.

06:08.720 --> 06:10.720
 Ramen is delicious.

06:12.720 --> 06:13.720
 What is that?

06:13.720 --> 06:15.720
 Ramen is delicious.

06:17.720 --> 06:19.720
 Rabbit angel and Mako girl.

06:20.720 --> 06:21.720
 That's great.

06:23.720 --> 06:24.720
 There are two more.

06:24.720 --> 06:29.696
 Thank you for watching.

06:30.696 --> 06:32.696
 I can't drink it without compliments.

06:32.696 --> 06:44.696
 See you next time!

06:46.232 --> 06:47.232
 Great!

06:48.232 --> 06:49.232
 That was a good line.

06:51.232 --> 06:52.232
 It was a good match.

06:56.232 --> 06:57.232
 What is your score, Hatsuki?

06:58.232 --> 06:59.232
 8 points.

07:00.232 --> 07:01.232
 4 points.

07:02.232 --> 07:03.232
 17 points.

07:04.232 --> 07:05.232
 17 points.

07:07.232 --> 07:08.232
 It was the same.

07:09.232 --> 07:10.232
 It was the same.

07:10.232 --> 07:11.232
 5 points.

07:12.232 --> 07:14.232
 Since we are here, let's make it a tie.

07:15.232 --> 07:16.232
 Great!

07:16.232 --> 07:17.232
 Great!

07:17.232 --> 07:18.232
 It was a good match.

07:18.232 --> 07:21.232
 Thank you for watching!

07:23.528 --> 07:26.528
 Hello, This is Round 2!

07:31.528 --> 07:33.028
 Good Luck!

07:33.028 --> 07:34.528
eto the start!

07:34.528 --> 07:36.528
 To the first turn,

07:38.528 --> 07:40.028
 Go behind with mind's eye!

07:40.028 --> 07:42.028
 Bye bye!

07:43.424 --> 07:45.424
 This looks like a water scene.

07:45.424 --> 07:47.424
 It's difficult.

07:47.424 --> 07:49.424
 I can't think of anything.

07:49.424 --> 07:51.424
 It's difficult.

07:51.424 --> 07:53.424
 It's okay.

07:53.424 --> 07:54.424
 I'll start.

07:54.424 --> 07:58.424
 The clothes that are scattered and
dropped in the water are all messed up.

07:58.424 --> 08:00.424
 I got it.

08:04.424 --> 08:06.424
 The word that makes you feel like
you're going to be in trouble.

08:06.424 --> 08:09.424
 The word that makes you feel like
you're going to be in trouble.

08:13.968 --> 08:15.968
 Cute.

08:15.968 --> 08:19.968
 Dan-chan is a greeting and a song.

08:19.968 --> 08:21.968
 I've never seen that.

08:25.968 --> 08:27.968
 I'm going to take a video.

08:29.968 --> 08:31.968
 Makeup time is 2 hours.

08:31.968 --> 08:33.504
 Please subscribe to my channel.

08:34.504 --> 08:35.504
 I'm scared.

08:37.504 --> 08:39.504
 She talks a lot of nonsense.

08:42.504 --> 08:43.504
 She is strong.

08:44.504 --> 08:45.504
 She is strong.

08:45.504 --> 08:46.504
 It was painful.

08:50.504 --> 08:51.504
 I'll go.

08:51.504 --> 08:53.504
 Tacos are popular at one time.

08:54.504 --> 08:55.504
 It's difficult.

08:55.504 --> 08:56.504
 It's not popular.

08:56.504 --> 09:01.504
 Please subscribe to my channel.

09:02.074 --> 09:03.074
 Q. Who is the most likely to be a good
friend of you?

09:03.074 --> 09:05.074
 A. Hima, the light girl.

09:07.074 --> 09:09.074
 That's a lie.

09:11.074 --> 09:12.074
 Q. Who is the most likely to be a good
friend of you?

09:12.074 --> 09:13.074
 A. Jaws, the grandchild.

09:13.074 --> 09:14.074
 Jaws?

09:14.074 --> 09:15.074
 No, it's not.

09:16.074 --> 09:17.074
 It's a lie.

09:17.074 --> 09:18.074
 It's a lie.

09:18.074 --> 09:19.074
 It's a lie.

09:23.074 --> 09:24.074
 Q. Who is the most likely to be a good
friend of you?

09:24.074 --> 09:25.074
 A. Isaka, the cringe queen.

09:25.074 --> 09:29.074
 It's a lie.

09:32.272 --> 09:36.272
 Karin's curling Center

09:36.272 --> 09:38.272
 You're in the frame!

09:38.272 --> 09:40.272
 You're touching her so beautifully!

09:40.272 --> 09:42.272
 You're touching her so beautifully!

09:42.272 --> 09:44.272
 This is fantastic!

09:44.928 --> 09:46.928
 I can't die!

09:46.928 --> 09:48.928
 I can't die!

09:48.928 --> 09:50.928
 I can't die!

09:50.928 --> 09:52.928
 I'm glad you're happy.

09:52.928 --> 09:54.928
 I'm so happy.

09:54.928 --> 09:56.928
 I'll go.

09:56.928 --> 09:58.928
 I often say to adults,

09:58.928 --> 10:00.928
 you're tall.

10:00.928 --> 10:02.928
 I think so.

10:04.928 --> 10:06.928
 Don't do the live.

10:06.928 --> 10:08.928
 I'm going to do it.

10:12.928 --> 10:14.928
 I'm going to do it.

10:14.928 --> 10:16.928
 I'm going to do it.

10:16.928 --> 10:18.928
 I'm going to do it.

10:18.928 --> 10:20.928
 I'm going to do it.

10:20.928 --> 10:22.928
 I'm going to do it.

10:22.928 --> 10:24.928
 It was amazing.

10:28.928 --> 10:30.928
 It looks fun.

10:30.928 --> 10:32.928
 I'll praise you for everything.

10:36.928 --> 10:38.928
 I thought it was a no.

10:38.928 --> 10:40.928
 Hirano is cute, too.

10:40.928 --> 10:42.928
 This?

10:44.928 --> 10:46.928
 Hirano.

10:48.928 --> 10:50.928
 The end.

10:50.928 --> 10:53.562
 Thank you for watching.

10:53.562 --> 10:55.562
 I'm so disappointed.

10:55.562 --> 10:57.562
 I wanted to eat the Almond.

10:57.562 --> 10:59.562
 I wanted to eat it.

10:59.562 --> 11:01.562
 Can I read it?

11:01.562 --> 11:03.562
 Let's do it.

11:03.562 --> 11:05.562
 I want to read it.

11:05.562 --> 11:07.562
 Let's count it.

11:07.562 --> 11:09.562
 1

11:09.562 --> 11:11.562
 2

11:11.562 --> 11:13.562
 3

11:13.562 --> 11:15.562
 4

11:15.562 --> 11:17.562
 5

11:17.562 --> 11:19.562
 6

11:19.562 --> 11:21.562
 7

11:21.562 --> 11:23.562
 8

11:23.562 --> 11:25.562
 9

11:25.562 --> 11:27.562
 10

11:27.562 --> 11:29.562
 11

11:29.562 --> 11:31.562
 12

11:31.562 --> 11:33.562
 13

11:33.562 --> 11:35.562
 14

11:35.562 --> 11:37.562
 15

11:37.562 --> 11:39.562
 16

11:39.562 --> 11:41.562
 I'm glad I got it.

11:41.562 --> 11:43.562
 I'll do my best.

11:43.562 --> 11:43.760
 I'll never eat it again.

11:43.760 --> 11:44.900
 Yeah!

11:46.632 --> 11:49.632
 The final match of Iginari Tohoku's 〇〇
Karuta.

11:52.632 --> 11:53.632
 Ryo! Ka! Ru! Ta!

11:55.632 --> 11:56.632
 Wow!

11:56.632 --> 11:57.632
 It's not that great.

11:58.632 --> 11:59.632
 What's Karuta?

12:00.632 --> 12:01.632
 Please be excited.

12:03.632 --> 12:04.632
 You're calm.

12:07.632 --> 12:08.632
 Look at this.

12:08.632 --> 12:09.632
 I'm not good at this.

12:13.632 --> 12:14.632
 Do your best.

12:16.632 --> 12:17.632
 I'm not good at this.

12:20.632 --> 12:21.632
 I can see your smile.

12:22.632 --> 12:23.632
 You're addicted.

12:25.632 --> 12:26.632
 I'll do my best.

12:26.632 --> 12:27.632
 I'm not good at this.

12:30.632 --> 12:32.632
 Ritsuki is next.

12:33.632 --> 12:34.632
 I'm not good at this.

12:34.632 --> 12:35.632
 Who is she?

12:37.632 --> 12:39.632
 I'm going to do my best.

12:45.632 --> 12:47.632
 I'll go to a restaurant when I'm
stressed.

12:50.632 --> 12:51.632
 I'll go to a club.

12:53.632 --> 12:54.632
 That's a prefectural competition.

12:56.632 --> 12:57.632
 You're too much.

12:57.632 --> 12:58.632
 I'm not good at this.

12:59.632 --> 13:01.632
 I'm not good at wearing a topknot.

13:04.632 --> 13:06.632
 I'm not good at wearing a necklace.

13:11.632 --> 13:12.632
 I'll do my best.

13:16.632 --> 13:17.632
 Miyagi is going to win.

13:17.632 --> 13:18.632
 I'll do my best.

13:20.632 --> 13:22.632
 I don't want to walk on the flat
ground.

13:22.632 --> 13:25.632
 I don't want to walk on the flat
ground.

13:25.632 --> 13:39.408
 Please look forward to the next video!

13:39.408 --> 13:42.408
 That's all for today!

13:46.202 --> 13:48.202
 I'm so nervous.

13:50.202 --> 13:52.202
 How do you feel now?

13:52.202 --> 13:54.202
 I'm going to die.

13:54.202 --> 13:56.202
 I'm going to die.

13:58.202 --> 14:00.202
 I don't want to die.

14:00.202 --> 14:02.202
 Good luck.

14:02.202 --> 14:04.202
 I love you, Kurie.

14:04.202 --> 14:06.202
 I love you, too.

14:08.202 --> 14:10.202
 Thank you.

14:10.202 --> 14:12.202
 The first question.

14:12.202 --> 14:14.202
 I love delicious food.

14:16.202 --> 14:18.202
 It's a prefecture-level competition.

14:18.202 --> 14:20.202
 Everyone is a representative of the
prefecture-level competition.

14:20.202 --> 14:22.202
 Yomitama is a representative of the
prefecture-level competition.

14:22.202 --> 14:24.202
 I'm nervous.

14:26.202 --> 14:28.202
 I like salmon.

14:28.202 --> 14:30.202
 Good luck.

14:30.202 --> 14:32.202
 Here, here.

14:32.202 --> 14:34.202
 What does this mean?

14:34.202 --> 14:36.202
 Here, here.

14:36.202 --> 14:38.202
 I'm in trouble.

14:38.202 --> 14:40.202
 I love salmon.

14:44.202 --> 14:46.202
 I'll go.

14:46.202 --> 14:48.202
 I'm going to open my bag.

14:48.202 --> 14:50.202
 I'm in trouble.

14:50.202 --> 14:52.202
 I'm in trouble.

14:54.202 --> 14:56.202
 I have a lot to say.

14:56.202 --> 14:58.202
 Go.

15:00.202 --> 15:02.202
 The last one.

15:02.202 --> 15:04.202
 What is this?

15:04.202 --> 15:08.202
 It's a bell of love.

15:14.202 --> 15:16.202
 It's a bell of love.

15:16.202 --> 15:18.202
 I'm in trouble.

15:18.202 --> 15:20.202
 I'm in trouble.

15:20.202 --> 15:22.202
 I'm in trouble.

15:22.202 --> 15:32.202
 Are you all right?

15:36.202 --> 15:38.202
 It's a scream.

15:40.202 --> 15:42.202
 It's over.

15:42.202 --> 15:44.202
 What was that?

15:44.202 --> 15:46.202
 It's over.

15:48.202 --> 15:50.202
 Good job.

15:50.202 --> 15:52.202
 Thank you.

15:52.202 --> 15:54.202
 Thank you for your hard work.

15:54.202 --> 15:56.202
 Thank you.

15:56.202 --> 15:58.202
 It was a prefecture-level competition.

15:58.202 --> 16:00.202
 A prefecture-level competition.

16:00.202 --> 16:02.202
 It was a hand-to-hand competition.

16:02.202 --> 16:04.202
 Who is the winner?

16:04.202 --> 16:06.202
 Let's count.

16:06.202 --> 16:24.202
 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15.

16:25.528 --> 16:31.528

16:50.096 --> 16:51.096
 I'm so happy!

16:52.096 --> 16:53.096
 I'm so happy!

16:54.096 --> 16:55.096
 I'm so happy!

16:58.096 --> 16:59.096
 The first...

17:04.096 --> 17:07.096
 The first, the self-made, Iginari,
Tohoku-san, Aruaru-Karuta.

17:07.096 --> 17:08.096
 Thank you!

17:10.328 --> 17:11.328
 The Queen is...

17:12.328 --> 17:14.328
 Akita Prefecture's representative...

17:14.328 --> 17:16.328
 I'm not really a representative.

17:17.328 --> 17:19.328
 It's Hikari Itsuki!

17:19.328 --> 17:21.328
 Congratulations!

17:23.328 --> 17:25.328

17:34.328 --> 17:37.328
 we can tell everyone what to do.

17:37.328 --> 17:39.328
 We can tell them,

17:39.328 --> 17:41.328
 we're MCs of the live show.
