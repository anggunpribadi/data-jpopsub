00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
I love you

2
00:00:02,330 --> 00:00:04,330
Good morning!

3
00:00:04,330 --> 00:00:06,330
Today is the day of the school festival.

4
00:00:06,330 --> 00:00:10,330
We are going to perform.

5
00:00:10,330 --> 00:00:13,330
Can you hear the sound of the sound
outside?

6
00:00:13,330 --> 00:00:15,330
Yes, I can hear it.

7
00:00:15,330 --> 00:00:17,330
Oh my god.

8
00:00:17,330 --> 00:00:19,330
It's so cute.

9
00:00:19,330 --> 00:00:21,330
Are you sleeping?

10
00:00:21,330 --> 00:00:27,330
The picture of the person who came out
of the water is half-frozen.

11
00:00:27,330 --> 00:00:32,330
That's a human.

12
00:00:32,330 --> 00:00:34,330
Are you okay?

13
00:00:34,330 --> 00:00:35,330
What?

14
00:00:35,330 --> 00:00:37,330
Are you saying that your face is not
good?

15
00:00:37,330 --> 00:00:39,330
Your hair is weird.

16
00:00:39,330 --> 00:00:41,330
I'm not good at it.

17
00:00:41,330 --> 00:00:43,984
I'm tired.

18
00:00:43,984 --> 00:00:45,984
Thank you.

19
00:00:47,984 --> 00:00:49,984

20
00:00:49,984 --> 00:00:51,984
Hello everyone.

21
00:00:51,984 --> 00:00:54,984
We are MIXNINE.

22
00:00:54,984 --> 00:00:56,984

23
00:00:56,984 --> 00:01:12,984

24
00:01:26,984 --> 00:01:28,984
Thank you.

25
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:38,400
Thank you for watching!

26
00:01:40,186 --> 00:01:42,186
To be connected with you every day

27
00:01:42,186 --> 00:01:42,766
Waaaa

28
00:01:53,152 --> 00:01:55,152
I'm so excited.

29
00:01:55,152 --> 00:01:57,152
I'm not sure how to say it.

30
00:01:57,152 --> 00:01:59,152
I'm so excited.

31
00:01:59,152 --> 00:02:01,152
We've finished the rehearsal.

32
00:02:01,152 --> 00:02:03,152
I'll put on makeup and get my hair done.

33
00:02:03,152 --> 00:02:05,152
I'll put on makeup and get my hair done.

34
00:02:05,152 --> 00:02:07,152
We'll have a concert.

35
00:02:07,152 --> 00:02:09,152
I thought,

36
00:02:09,152 --> 00:02:11,152
I thought I was going to watch the
rehearsal.

37
00:02:11,152 --> 00:02:13,152
I thought I was going to watch the
rehearsal.

38
00:02:13,152 --> 00:02:15,152
I was wondering about it.

39
00:02:15,152 --> 00:02:17,152
I hope you're looking forward to it.

40
00:02:17,152 --> 00:02:19,584
Bye.

41
00:02:19,584 --> 00:02:21,584
Here she comes.

42
00:02:21,584 --> 00:02:23,584
Look at me.

43
00:02:23,584 --> 00:02:25,584
Oh, really?

44
00:02:25,584 --> 00:02:27,584
When we first met,

45
00:02:27,584 --> 00:02:29,584
she was looking at me.

46
00:02:29,584 --> 00:02:31,584
She was looking at me.

47
00:02:31,584 --> 00:02:33,584
That's hard.

48
00:02:33,584 --> 00:02:35,584
Look at me.

49
00:02:35,584 --> 00:02:36,896
She's waving.

50
00:02:36,896 --> 00:02:38,896
We're wearing a mask today.

51
00:02:38,896 --> 00:02:39,896
Yes.

52
00:02:41,896 --> 00:02:44,896
We're wearing yellow clothes.

53
00:02:44,896 --> 00:02:46,896
So we're going to wear a mask.

54
00:02:46,896 --> 00:02:47,896
Yes.

55
00:02:49,896 --> 00:02:50,896
Let's do our best.

56
00:02:51,896 --> 00:02:52,896
Is there a time limit?

57
00:02:52,896 --> 00:02:53,896
Is there?

58
00:02:53,896 --> 00:02:54,896
Is there?

59
00:02:54,896 --> 00:02:55,896
How many minutes?

60
00:02:55,896 --> 00:02:57,896
How many minutes?

61
00:03:01,896 --> 00:03:02,896
How many minutes?

62
00:03:02,896 --> 00:03:03,896
How many minutes?

63
00:03:03,896 --> 00:03:04,896
How many minutes?

64
00:03:04,896 --> 00:03:05,896
How many minutes?

65
00:03:05,896 --> 00:03:06,896
How many minutes?

66
00:03:06,896 --> 00:03:07,896
Wait.

Ready...

71
00:03:11,896 --> 00:03:12,896
Jupiter in love?

72
00:03:12,896 --> 00:03:13,896
Ready...

73
00:03:13,896 --> 00:03:14,896
A song...

74
00:03:14,896 --> 00:03:16,896
In the music video...

75
00:03:16,896 --> 00:03:17,896
Ready...

Ready...

79
00:03:20,896 --> 00:03:22,896
The Cider in July.

00:03:22,896 --> 00:03:24,896
MC Asahi.

81
00:03:24,896 --> 00:03:25,896

00:03:28,896 --> 00:03:30,896
One of you will leave something behind.

86
00:03:30,896 --> 00:03:31,896
What?

87
00:03:31,896 --> 00:03:32,896
One, two, three...

88
00:03:32,896 --> 00:03:34,896
I'm sorry.

89
00:03:34,896 --> 00:03:36,896
What was the song?

90
00:03:36,896 --> 00:03:38,896
What was the song?

91
00:03:38,896 --> 00:03:40,896
It was this.

92
00:03:42,896 --> 00:03:44,896
The song title is good.

93
00:03:44,896 --> 00:03:46,896
Ko-chan.

94
00:03:46,896 --> 00:03:48,896

00:03:50,896 --> 00:03:52,896
Katakata.

97
00:03:52,896 --> 00:03:54,896
I thought it was a dog.

98
00:03:54,896 --> 00:03:56,896
Isn't it a dog?

99
00:03:56,896 --> 00:03:58,896
It's a dog, right?

100
00:03:58,896 --> 00:04:00,896
Dog.

101
00:04:00,896 --> 00:04:02,896
It's barking.

102
00:04:04,896 --> 00:04:06,896
It's teeth are hard.

103
00:04:06,896 --> 00:04:08,896
It's teeth are hard.

104
00:04:08,896 --> 00:04:10,896
I'm going to have a hard time.

105
00:04:10,896 --> 00:04:24,896
Na, Na, Na, Na, Na.

106
00:04:25,200 --> 00:04:27,200
It's so cold.

107
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:29,200
It's so warm.

108
00:04:29,200 --> 00:04:31,200
I feel so happy.

109
00:04:32,200 --> 00:04:34,200
I feel so happy.

110
00:04:34,200 --> 00:04:35,200
It's so nice.

111
00:04:35,200 --> 00:04:37,200
It's like the warmth of the storm.

112
00:04:37,200 --> 00:04:39,200
I feel like I'm flying.

113
00:04:39,200 --> 00:04:41,616
I feel so happy.

114
00:04:41,616 --> 00:04:43,616
I'm so happy.

115
00:04:43,616 --> 00:04:45,616
I'm so happy.

116
00:04:45,616 --> 00:04:48,616
I always did this when I was in
elementary school.

117
00:04:48,616 --> 00:04:51,616
I was always doing this when I was in
elementary school.

118
00:04:51,616 --> 00:04:53,616
I didn't do this.

119
00:04:53,616 --> 00:04:55,616
I didn't do this.

120
00:04:55,616 --> 00:04:58,616
Everyone was standing in front of the
stove.

121
00:04:58,616 --> 00:05:00,616
I was in the air conditioner since
middle school.

122
00:05:00,616 --> 00:05:02,616
You were in the air conditioner?

123
00:05:02,616 --> 00:05:05,616
I was in the fan and heater.

124
00:05:05,616 --> 00:05:07,616
I'm looking forward to it.

125
00:05:07,616 --> 00:05:11,616
It's my first time to be on a school
festival.

126
00:05:11,616 --> 00:05:27,344
Please look forward to it.

127
00:05:27,344 --> 00:05:29,344
Thank you.

128
00:05:31,400 --> 00:05:32,240

130
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,400
I wanted it

131
00:05:38,900 --> 00:05:39,720
Same?

132
00:05:42,060 --> 00:05:44,040
I'm sure it's the same

133
00:05:50,360 --> 00:05:51,960
And then the next is the left

I can't do it anytime.

145
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:18,400
I can't say it's the last time.

146
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:20,400
I can't feel it forever.

147
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:22,400
I'm sure I'm better than you.

148
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:24,400
I'm sure I'm better than you.

149
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:26,400
I'm sure I'm better than you.

Thank you very much!

193
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:34,720
It was fun!

194
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:36,720
Thank you!

195
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:40,720
I want to come again!

196
00:10:07,720 --> 00:10:15,720
Why is it that when I smile, the world
seems to be shining?

197
00:10:15,720 --> 00:10:23,720
I can relax by turning the umbrella,
otherwise I can't walk

198
00:10:23,720 --> 00:10:31,720
I'm sure someone is crying somewhere,
I'm getting wet somewhere again, isn't
it cold?

199
00:10:31,720 --> 00:10:39,720
I'm sure someone is crying somewhere, I
want to share my feelings with you

200
00:10:39,720 --> 00:10:51,152
I don't know the scenery in front of me,
let's go anywhere

201
00:10:51,152 --> 00:10:55,152
Goodbye Goodbye Thank you for yesterday

202
00:10:55,152 --> 00:10:59,152
The cityscape after the rain is colored

203
00:10:59,152 --> 00:11:03,152
I painted a fragment of the future on
the canvas of my broken heart

204
00:11:03,152 --> 00:11:23,152
It will lead me

205
00:11:23,706 --> 00:11:28,506
I can say it now, even the reason for my
tears

206
00:11:28,506 --> 00:11:32,706
When I'm lost, I immediately remember

207
00:11:32,706 --> 00:11:36,706
Even if it rains, I'll smile

208
00:11:36,706 --> 00:11:40,706
Look, let's go anywhere

209
00:11:40,706 --> 00:11:44,706
Goodbye, goodbye to me from yesterday

210
00:11:44,706 --> 00:11:48,706
The cityscape after the rain is
sparkling

211
00:11:48,706 --> 00:11:50,706
My heart is like a spring

212
00:11:50,706 --> 00:11:53,706
Playing the sound of the rainbow

213
00:11:53,706 --> 00:11:57,706
Playing the rainbow piano

214
00:11:57,706 --> 00:12:01,706
Goodbye, goodbye to me from yesterday

215
00:12:01,706 --> 00:12:05,706
The cityscape after the rain is
sparkling

216
00:12:05,706 --> 00:12:07,706
My heart is like a spring

217
00:12:07,706 --> 00:12:09,706
Drying the tears

218
00:12:09,706 --> 00:12:21,706
I'll wear a rainbow dress

219
00:12:21,824 --> 00:12:26,824
LaLaLa...
