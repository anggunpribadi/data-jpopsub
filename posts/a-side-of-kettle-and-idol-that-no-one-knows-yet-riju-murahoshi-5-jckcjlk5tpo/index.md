The final episode of the talk with Ukka's Riju Murahoshi and Kakan-kun.
We would like to ask him about his enthusiasm for this autumn's one-man live and Star Plaza Festival!

★The latest episode is updated at 19:00 from Monday to Friday, and at 12:00 on Saturdays, Sundays, and holidays!
A personality developed in a kettle who works at Stardust headquarters.
His wish is, ``I'll make some delicious tea, so please let me talk to the idol.''
“Kettle-kun” was born in the hot water supply room.
Get closer to the charm of cute idols!
