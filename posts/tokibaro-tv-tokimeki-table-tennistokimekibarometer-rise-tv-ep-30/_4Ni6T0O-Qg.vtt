00:00.000 --> 00:04.000
 I was called out by someone.

00:04.000 --> 00:09.000
 I don't know why, but I feel like I'm
being held by two old people.

00:09.000 --> 00:10.000
 I'm scared.

00:10.000 --> 00:12.000
 What?

00:12.000 --> 00:13.000
 I'm scared.

00:13.000 --> 00:15.000
 What's wrong, Hiyori?

00:15.000 --> 00:17.000
 You can tell by looking at me, right?

00:17.000 --> 00:18.000
 I'm scared.

00:18.000 --> 00:27.000
 Today, we're going to decide who is the
best at table tennis.

00:27.000 --> 00:30.000
 Yeah!

00:30.000 --> 00:31.000
 We won by table tennis.

00:31.000 --> 00:38.000
 We won by table tennis because we won
the bowling competition.

00:38.000 --> 00:40.282
 This time, we're going to decide who is
the best at table tennis.

00:40.282 --> 00:42.282
 I want to decide the number one.

00:42.282 --> 00:44.282
 Kanami is not here today.

00:44.282 --> 00:46.282
 It's okay.

00:46.282 --> 00:48.282
 I'm winning against those two.

00:48.282 --> 00:50.282
 I'm going to win against these two.

00:50.282 --> 01:00.634
 I'm going to decide the number one of
these four.

01:00.634 --> 01:06.634
 This program is a program that will
challenge various things in order to
promote something exciting.

01:06.634 --> 01:31.634
 It is a program that will raise the
barometer of excitement in the world!

01:31.770 --> 01:39.770
 に

01:48.058 --> 01:54.058
 The person who gets the most points
wins.

01:54.058 --> 01:58.058
 The person who gets 11 points first
wins.

01:58.058 --> 02:00.058
 11 points?

02:00.058 --> 02:03.058
 The winner will be decided by the
number of points.

02:03.058 --> 02:08.058
 Let's say goodbye with Good-bye.

02:08.058 --> 02:10.058
 Good-bye.

02:10.058 --> 02:20.058
 Please subscribe to our channel.

02:20.218 --> 02:26.218
 To be honest, Hiyori-chan doesn't seem
to be playing table tennis.

02:26.218 --> 02:29.218
 So I think she can do it.

02:29.218 --> 02:34.218
 I don't think she can be a match for
me.

02:34.218 --> 02:39.218
 I have a special move called Oharu
Smash.

02:39.218 --> 02:41.218
 I want to learn it.

02:41.218 --> 02:45.218
 I think she has a good sense of sports.

02:45.218 --> 02:48.218
 I think I can beat Oharu.

02:48.218 --> 02:50.218
 Sorry, Oharu.

02:50.218 --> 02:55.218
 It's Oharu vs. Hiyori.

02:55.218 --> 03:00.218
 Actually, Oharu is good at playing
table tennis.

03:00.218 --> 03:01.218
 I'm good at it.

03:01.218 --> 03:04.218
 She can smash the table tennis.

03:04.218 --> 03:08.218
 So she can play the table tennis of the
human world.

03:08.218 --> 03:11.218
 I'll do my best to beat her.

03:11.218 --> 03:17.218
 I won't lose to a piece of junk called
Wii.

03:17.218 --> 03:19.218
 Come on!

03:19.218 --> 03:21.218
 Damn it!

03:21.218 --> 03:23.218
 Oh, my God.

03:23.218 --> 03:35.218
 The match of the older members is
starting!

03:38.280 --> 03:39.280
 Oh!

03:40.280 --> 03:41.280
 Oh!

03:41.280 --> 03:42.280
 Hane-chan!

03:42.280 --> 03:44.280
 The way she takes the ball is so lame!

03:45.280 --> 03:47.280
 I see, I have to hit it.

03:49.280 --> 03:50.280
 Oh, that's hot!

03:50.280 --> 03:51.280
 Hiyori?

03:51.280 --> 03:52.280
 Hiyori!

03:52.280 --> 03:53.280
 Isn't it Hiyori-chan?

03:57.280 --> 03:58.280
 Oh!

03:58.280 --> 03:59.280
 Ah!

03:59.280 --> 04:02.280
 converted from guitar to only one voice

04:06.072 --> 04:07.072
 Hey!

04:07.072 --> 04:08.072
 Wow!

04:08.072 --> 04:09.072
 Ha ha ha ha!

04:09.072 --> 04:11.072
 You can't do that!

04:11.072 --> 04:12.072
 Wait a minute!

04:12.072 --> 04:13.072
 One, two!

04:13.072 --> 04:14.072
 Hey!

04:14.072 --> 04:15.072
 Hey!

04:15.072 --> 04:16.072
 Wow!

04:16.072 --> 04:17.072
 Oh!

04:17.072 --> 04:18.072
 Oh!

04:18.072 --> 04:19.072
 Oh!

04:19.072 --> 04:20.072
 Oh!

04:20.072 --> 04:21.072
 Oh!

04:21.072 --> 04:22.072
 Oh!

04:22.072 --> 04:23.072
 Oh!

04:23.072 --> 04:24.072
 Oh!

04:24.072 --> 04:25.072
 Oh!

04:25.072 --> 04:26.072
 Oh!

04:26.072 --> 04:27.072
 Oh!

04:27.072 --> 04:28.072
 Oh!

04:28.072 --> 04:29.072
 Oh!

04:29.072 --> 04:30.072
 Oh!

04:30.072 --> 04:31.072
 Oh!

04:31.072 --> 04:31.290
 Oh!

04:31.290 --> 04:33.290
 Are you okay?

04:33.290 --> 04:35.290
 Let's do it one by one.

04:35.290 --> 04:37.290
 It's not good.

04:37.290 --> 04:39.290
 One more time?

04:43.290 --> 04:45.290
 I'll do it.

04:51.290 --> 04:53.290
 Which one?

04:53.290 --> 04:59.184
 To be continued.

05:00.184 --> 05:02.184
 The game is getting more and more
intense.

05:02.184 --> 05:03.184
 No way!

05:03.184 --> 05:04.184
 She's doing it.

05:04.184 --> 05:05.184
 It's crazy.

05:08.184 --> 05:09.184
 She did it!

05:12.184 --> 05:13.184
 Here I go.

05:16.184 --> 05:17.184
 She did it!

05:17.184 --> 05:18.184
 Ohari-chan.

05:20.184 --> 05:21.184
 It's crazy.

05:22.184 --> 05:23.184
 It's crazy.

05:23.184 --> 05:25.184
 She got 5000 points.

05:25.184 --> 05:26.184
 It's crazy.

05:28.968 --> 05:29.968
 That was close!

05:31.968 --> 05:33.968
 The person who did the WII is crazy.

05:34.968 --> 05:35.968
 The WII is amazing.

05:43.968 --> 05:44.968
 It's Oharu.

05:45.968 --> 05:46.968
 I think I'm a little lucky today.

05:46.968 --> 05:49.968
 The WII is amazing.

05:59.738 --> 06:05.938
 Robocop's mixer makes trills

06:05.938 --> 06:06.778
 Sanae.

06:07.038 --> 06:07.778
 Lood.

06:07.778 --> 06:09.778
 Please!

06:10.384 --> 06:11.384
 I don't like this!

06:11.384 --> 06:12.384
 Wow!

06:12.384 --> 06:13.384
 Oh!

06:13.384 --> 06:14.384
 Oh!

06:14.384 --> 06:15.384
 Oh!

06:15.384 --> 06:16.384
 Oh!

06:16.384 --> 06:18.384
 You're holding a wall!

06:18.384 --> 06:20.384
 You're holding a wall!

06:20.384 --> 06:21.384
 Oh!

06:22.384 --> 06:23.384
 Wow!

06:23.384 --> 06:24.384
 Okay.

06:24.384 --> 06:25.384
 I got one point.

06:25.384 --> 06:26.384
 Beautiful.

06:26.384 --> 06:27.384
 Here I go.

06:27.384 --> 06:28.384
 Wow!

06:28.384 --> 06:29.384
 Ah!

06:29.384 --> 06:30.384
 Oh, no!

06:30.384 --> 06:31.384
 Yuri!

06:31.384 --> 06:32.384
 Yuri's score is...

06:32.384 --> 06:33.384
 Oh, wow!

06:33.384 --> 06:34.384
 4 points.

06:34.384 --> 06:35.384
 Ha!

06:35.384 --> 06:36.384
 Okay, next.

06:36.384 --> 06:37.384
 Okay, start up.

06:37.384 --> 06:38.384
 Wow!

06:38.384 --> 06:39.384
 Oh, Yuri!

06:39.384 --> 06:40.384
 Wow!

06:40.384 --> 06:41.384
 Wow!

06:41.384 --> 06:42.384
 Isn't it good?

06:42.384 --> 06:43.384
 You're getting better.

06:43.384 --> 06:44.384
 Isn't it good?

06:44.384 --> 06:45.384
 Is this how you do it?

06:45.384 --> 06:46.384
 Don't say that.

06:46.384 --> 06:47.384
 Sorry.

06:47.384 --> 06:48.384
 Sorry.

06:48.384 --> 06:49.384
 Look.

06:49.384 --> 06:50.384
 Ha!

06:50.384 --> 06:51.384
 Ha!

06:51.384 --> 06:52.384
 Wow!

06:52.384 --> 06:53.384
 Wow!

06:53.384 --> 06:54.384
 Yuri!

06:54.384 --> 06:55.384
 Wow!

06:55.384 --> 06:56.384
 Wow!

06:56.384 --> 06:57.384
 Good, good.

06:57.384 --> 06:58.384
 You're doing good.

06:58.384 --> 06:59.384
 Be careful.

06:59.384 --> 07:00.384
 Ha!

07:00.384 --> 07:01.384
 Wow!

07:01.384 --> 07:02.384
 Yuri!

07:02.384 --> 07:05.888
 Yuri!

07:06.748 --> 07:07.448
 Oh no!

07:09.328 --> 07:11.908
 What, we're still falling behind?

07:11.908 --> 07:14.528
 We're just paribing and riding the
waves

07:14.528 --> 07:16.588
 He is riding it pretty well

07:16.588 --> 07:17.148
 Yeah

07:24.848 --> 07:25.488
 Right on!

07:25.488 --> 07:26.908
 That was insane

07:26.908 --> 07:27.908
 This difference

07:27.908 --> 07:28.868
 You're falling out!​

07:36.122 --> 07:38.122
 It's a tie!

07:38.122 --> 07:40.122
 It's a tie!

07:40.122 --> 07:42.122
 Wow!

07:42.122 --> 07:44.122
 We're not even running.

07:44.122 --> 07:46.122
 Here I go.

07:52.122 --> 07:54.122
 No!

07:54.122 --> 07:56.122
 Oh, it's a match point.

07:56.122 --> 07:58.122
 Oh no!

07:58.122 --> 08:00.122
 I lost.

08:03.226 --> 08:05.226
 Wow

08:05.226 --> 08:07.226
 It's a good match

08:07.226 --> 08:09.226
 If you score 2 points, you win

08:09.226 --> 08:11.226
 I'm going

08:13.226 --> 08:15.226
 I did it

08:15.226 --> 08:17.226
 This is

08:17.226 --> 08:19.226
 1 point left

08:19.226 --> 08:21.226
 Are you okay?

08:21.226 --> 08:21.728
 I'm going

08:22.728 --> 08:24.728
 I'm going

08:26.728 --> 08:28.728
 Are you okay?

08:30.728 --> 08:32.728
 Stop it

08:36.728 --> 08:38.728
 I'm going

08:38.728 --> 08:39.760
 See you next time

08:40.760 --> 08:41.760
 I'm going

08:42.760 --> 08:44.760
 It's a good match

08:44.760 --> 08:46.760
 It's a good match

08:46.760 --> 08:53.760
 Please subscribe to my channel!

08:53.776 --> 08:55.776
 I don't want to lose.

08:55.776 --> 08:57.776
 Oh my god.

08:57.776 --> 08:59.776
 I got it!

09:03.776 --> 09:05.776
 I got it!

09:07.776 --> 09:09.776
 I did it!

09:11.776 --> 09:13.776
 Wow!

09:13.776 --> 09:15.776
 I barely did anything.

09:15.776 --> 09:17.776
 It was a fierce battle.

09:17.776 --> 09:19.776
 You used this.

09:19.776 --> 09:21.776
 I didn't use it.

09:21.776 --> 09:23.776
 I just hit it.

09:23.776 --> 09:25.776
 It was fun.

09:25.776 --> 09:27.776
 I'm just doing it.

09:27.776 --> 09:29.776
 It was amazing to burn it up.

09:29.776 --> 09:31.776
 It was amazing.

09:31.776 --> 09:33.776
 It was fun.

09:48.762 --> 09:53.762
 I think I can do it at school.

09:53.762 --> 09:55.762
 I'm a middle school student.

09:55.762 --> 10:00.762
 I've been doing it with my friends
since junior high school.

10:00.762 --> 10:04.762
 I've never won, but I'll do my best.

10:04.762 --> 10:06.762
 I think I can do it.

10:06.762 --> 10:11.762
 I've been listening to a song called
Family Complex.

10:11.762 --> 10:15.762
 Each member's name is in the lyrics.

10:15.762 --> 10:18.762
 I didn't know the lyrics at first.

10:18.762 --> 10:22.762
 I was listening to Hinata's song.

10:22.762 --> 10:26.762
 I thought it was a Kashiwagi.

10:26.762 --> 10:29.762
 Everyone was so excited.

10:29.762 --> 10:34.762
 I thought it was a good song.

10:34.762 --> 10:38.042
 I'm going to do my best.

10:38.042 --> 10:43.042
 Now, it's time for the match between
Vanjilia and me.

10:43.042 --> 10:46.042
 Ready, start!

10:50.042 --> 10:51.042
 Which one?

10:51.042 --> 10:52.042
 This one?

10:52.042 --> 10:53.042
 What's this?

10:53.042 --> 10:54.042
 Which one?

10:56.042 --> 10:58.042
 We have rules.

10:58.042 --> 11:04.730
 The match between Vanjilia and me.

11:04.730 --> 11:08.730
 This is what happens when you're a
Bunchan.

11:14.730 --> 11:16.730
 That's it!

11:16.730 --> 11:18.730
 Julia wins.

11:22.730 --> 11:24.730
 Wait!

11:24.730 --> 11:26.730
 Wait a minute.

11:26.730 --> 11:28.730
 Here I go.

11:31.312 --> 11:33.992
 Bandi points!

11:50.336 --> 11:53.376
 Stop bombing That's right.

11:53.376 --> 11:55.136
 ni

11:58.056 --> 12:00.656
 re

12:02.656 --> 12:05.656
 ana

12:05.656 --> 12:08.376
 I'm rich

12:08.376 --> 12:09.376
 Thank you very much.

12:14.650 --> 12:17.650
 I'm going to go for the Bambi's score.

12:17.650 --> 12:20.650
 No, the Giulia's score.

12:20.650 --> 12:22.650
 I'm going to go for it.

12:25.650 --> 12:27.650
 Which one is it?

12:27.650 --> 12:29.650
 The Giulia's score.

12:29.650 --> 12:31.650
 I'm going to lose.

12:35.650 --> 12:37.650
 Wow, that was fast.

12:37.650 --> 12:42.650
 The Bambi's score.

12:44.104 --> 12:46.104
 You're doing well.

12:52.104 --> 12:54.104
 Julia's score.

13:00.104 --> 13:02.104
 What was that?

13:03.104 --> 13:05.104
 Wait, that was bad?

13:05.104 --> 13:07.104
 Julia's score.

13:11.536 --> 13:12.536
 Yeah.

13:15.536 --> 13:16.536
 Wow.

13:16.536 --> 13:17.536
 Oh!

13:17.536 --> 13:18.536
 Thank you.

13:29.018 --> 13:31.018
 I'm going to start.

13:35.018 --> 13:36.018
 Bambi.

13:36.018 --> 13:37.018
 7.

13:38.018 --> 13:39.018
 7 to 8.

13:44.018 --> 13:45.018
 Bambi.

13:45.018 --> 13:46.018
 6 points.

13:46.018 --> 13:47.018
 6 points.

13:47.018 --> 13:48.018
 Go for it.

13:48.018 --> 13:54.018
 What was that?

13:55.656 --> 13:57.656
 Bambi passed the ball.

13:57.656 --> 14:07.656
 Bambi passed the ball.

14:08.936 --> 14:10.936
 Bambi passed the ball.

14:11.936 --> 14:13.936
 Bambi passed the ball.

14:14.936 --> 14:16.936
 Bambi won the game.

14:20.936 --> 14:24.936
 It was like a beginner's game.

14:25.936 --> 14:28.936
 But, Bambi was so cool in the second
half.

14:28.936 --> 14:30.936
 She was so cool.

14:31.936 --> 14:33.936
 Bambi was a repairer.

14:33.936 --> 14:35.936
 Bambi was a repairer.

14:35.936 --> 14:37.936
 Bye bye.

14:37.936 --> 14:44.936
 To be continued.

14:47.898 --> 14:50.318
 We've gone through the process of
taking five

14:51.498 --> 14:53.358
 and in the end surprised about the
amount of input

14:53.678 --> 14:54.258
 That's true

14:54.258 --> 14:56.118
 You got five

15:02.958 --> 15:06.778
 7 members of 1 minute KANO, 30 seconds
MEGUMI, 10 seconds KANO

15:07.386 --> 15:13.386
 I want to perform live with my
passionate and passionate personality.

15:13.386 --> 15:16.386
 I will definitely show you a more
powerful image than last year.

15:16.386 --> 15:21.386
 I'm really glad that SenzenBerry is
cheering for us.

15:21.386 --> 15:25.386
 Our history has just begun.

15:25.386 --> 15:32.386
 I think that if everyone is together,
there is no such thing and the
possibilities are limitless.

15:32.386 --> 15:43.386
 If SenzenBerry and the members are
together, we believe that we can
definitely make a big wall into a small
wall.

15:43.386 --> 15:48.464
 So, please wait for us, Nakano-san and
Pura-san!

15:48.464 --> 15:54.464
 Dash! Dash! Dash! Let's chase our
dreams!

15:54.464 --> 15:59.464
 Dash! Dash! Dash! A dream that will
never wake up!

15:59.464 --> 16:04.464
 If I'm with you, I can make it come
true!

16:04.464 --> 16:09.464
 I'll become a Breaky!

16:26.842 --> 16:28.842
 Let's start!

16:28.842 --> 16:30.842
 10 people?

16:34.842 --> 16:36.842
 I'll kiss you.

16:36.842 --> 16:38.842
 Wow, gorgeous!

16:38.842 --> 16:40.842
 I'll take a picture.

16:46.842 --> 16:48.842
 Wow!

16:48.842 --> 16:50.842
 Let's do this.

16:50.842 --> 16:52.842
 I'll kiss you.

16:55.624 --> 16:57.624
 I did it!

17:03.624 --> 17:05.624
 This is going to be a jacket photo.

17:06.624 --> 17:07.624
 Wow!

17:08.624 --> 17:10.624
 I'll take a jacket photo.

17:11.624 --> 17:12.624
 It's amazing.

17:12.624 --> 17:14.624
 Bye bye!
