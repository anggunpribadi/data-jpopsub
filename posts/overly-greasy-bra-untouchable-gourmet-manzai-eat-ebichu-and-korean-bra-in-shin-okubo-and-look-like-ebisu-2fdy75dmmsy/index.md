It is broadcast every Wednesday late at night on Tokai TV.

When you rub the mysterious oil-covered lamp, what pops out is Zakiya Majin, who loves delicious food! This time's hungry guests are Kaho Kobayashi and Yuno Kokubo from Shiritsu Ebisu Chugaku. First up is Samgyeopsal, which is plump shrimp wrapped in pork belly and grilled, at a popular restaurant with a long line of people and reputed to be the best value for money! Furthermore, it is dipped in plenty of cheese and shows off its mellow Tairage Ebisu face!
