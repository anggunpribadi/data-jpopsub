00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Ebichu's video

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:08,920
Hello, I'm Miru

3
00:00:08,920 --> 00:00:10,920
I'm Kuma Yoshikawa

4
00:00:10,920 --> 00:00:12,920
The dog is barking

5
00:00:12,920 --> 00:00:14,920
The dog is barking

6
00:00:14,920 --> 00:00:16,920
Don't bark at the dog

7
00:00:16,920 --> 00:00:18,920
I wonder if it's related to the barking

8
00:00:18,920 --> 00:00:24,920
So, Ebichu's video is a celebration of
the first anniversary

9
00:00:24,920 --> 00:00:26,920
I've been watching it for a while

10
00:00:26,920 --> 00:00:30,920
Who are you?

11
00:00:30,920 --> 00:00:32,920
Kaho

12
00:00:32,920 --> 00:00:34,920
Today, you came here

13
00:00:34,920 --> 00:00:36,920
Great

14
00:00:36,920 --> 00:00:38,920
I was eaten

15
00:00:38,920 --> 00:00:43,920
Today, a friend of mine came

16
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:47,920
Everyone, you're so great

17
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:49,920
I'm 4pen

18
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:54,920
So, here it is

19
00:00:54,920 --> 00:00:59,920
I'm at 4pen cafe

20
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:01,920
It's on the screen

21
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:03,920
Cute

22
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:05,920
I'm looking forward to it

23
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:15,920
This is 4pen cafe in Soramachi

24
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:27,920
I'm going to go to 4pen cafe with my
game friend, 2pen

25
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:31,920
I heard that 4pen cafe is open

26
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:34,920
I said let's go

27
00:01:34,920 --> 00:01:39,920
So, I'm going to go with Ebichu's video

28
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:41,920
Let's go together

29
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:47,920
I'm going to go with Ebichu's video

30
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:51,920
Let's go

31
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:53,920
Bye

32
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:55,920
Bye

33
00:01:55,920 --> 00:02:01,920
We went to 4pen cafe

34
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:04,920
We took a lot of pictures

35
00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:11,920
We will talk about this picture

36
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:13,920
We will deliver it

37
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:17,920
Let's go to 4pen cafe

38
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:21,920
We came to 4pen cafe

39
00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:28,920
This is 4pen cafe in Soramachi

40
00:02:28,920 --> 00:02:31,920
I'm glad I went

41
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:33,920
Everyone was popular

42
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:35,874
There are many people

43
00:02:35,874 --> 00:02:39,374
There was a person who was taking
pictures.

44
00:02:39,374 --> 00:02:42,574
The social distance was properly
protected.

45
00:02:42,574 --> 00:02:44,214
It was a draw.

46
00:02:44,214 --> 00:02:46,454
This is KOUPEN.

47
00:02:46,454 --> 00:02:49,494
You are not KOUPEN.

48
00:02:49,494 --> 00:02:52,614
You are talking to yourself.

49
00:02:52,614 --> 00:02:55,094
I'm talking to myself.

50
00:02:55,094 --> 00:02:58,854
You are eating with me.

51
00:02:58,854 --> 00:03:00,654
This is KOUPEN.

52
00:03:00,654 --> 00:03:02,574
This is AISUKI KOUPEN.

53
00:03:02,574 --> 00:03:11,174
This is a great KOUPEN that can be your
partner even if you come alone.

54
00:03:11,174 --> 00:03:15,894
This is a system that can be placed on
the side.

55
00:03:15,894 --> 00:03:16,974
This is a picture that has been posted.

56
00:03:16,974 --> 00:03:19,294
This is cute.

57
00:03:19,294 --> 00:03:25,414
This is a picture taken by MIREPEN.

58
00:03:25,414 --> 00:03:29,654
This is a picture taken by KOUPEN.

59
00:03:29,654 --> 00:03:31,854
There were many MIREPEN.

60
00:03:31,854 --> 00:03:37,934
This is the picture taken by me and
KOUPEN.

61
00:03:37,934 --> 00:03:41,934
I wonder if KOUPEN took this picture.

62
00:03:41,934 --> 00:03:45,094
This is a great picture taken by
MIREPEN.

63
00:03:45,094 --> 00:03:47,654
This is an acrylic plate.

64
00:03:47,654 --> 00:03:50,254
This is a picture taken safely.

65
00:03:50,254 --> 00:03:53,774
This is a picture taken by MIREPEN.

66
00:03:53,774 --> 00:03:57,254
This is a picture taken when choosing
goods.

67
00:03:57,254 --> 00:03:59,614
This is a picture taken when choosing
goods.

68
00:03:59,614 --> 00:04:01,754
This was taken when I was very worried
about it.

69
00:04:01,754 --> 00:04:05,814
I was worried about which one to buy
because they were all cute.

70
00:04:05,814 --> 00:04:12,334
There are many AISUKI KOUPEN.

71
00:04:12,334 --> 00:04:17,694
This is a picture taken by KOUPEN.

72
00:04:17,694 --> 00:04:22,534
This is a picture taken by KOUPEN.

73
00:04:22,534 --> 00:04:25,454
This is a picture taken by KOUPEN.

74
00:04:25,454 --> 00:04:26,734
This is cute.

75
00:04:26,734 --> 00:04:29,054
I found a person who was floating.

76
00:04:29,054 --> 00:04:33,134
This is the appearance of MIREPEN
carrying KOUPEN.

77
00:04:33,134 --> 00:04:36,694
This is also a picture taken with goods.

78
00:04:36,694 --> 00:04:38,274
This is cute.

79
00:04:38,274 --> 00:04:39,814
This person is floating.

80
00:04:39,814 --> 00:04:41,574
This person is floating.

81
00:04:41,574 --> 00:04:44,254
This person is holding a picture.

82
00:04:44,254 --> 00:04:46,174
This person is floating.

83
00:04:46,174 --> 00:04:48,814
This is a picture taken with a
reversible cushion.

84
00:04:48,814 --> 00:04:51,614
This person is cute.

85
00:04:51,614 --> 00:04:54,574
This person is carrying KOUPEN.

86
00:04:54,574 --> 00:05:01,574
This person is floating.

87
00:05:01,574 --> 00:05:06,334
This is the picture taken by MIREPEN.

88
00:05:06,334 --> 00:05:08,226
This person is holding a picture.

89
00:05:08,226 --> 00:05:17,226
This is a puppet and another one is a
mascot that Ko-Pen-chan is a type of
animal.

90
00:05:17,226 --> 00:05:18,066
cute

91
00:05:18,066 --> 00:05:19,826
Ko-Pen-chan, let me fly alone.

92
00:05:19,826 --> 00:05:24,306
Ko-Pen-chan, Ko-Pen-chan, Ko-Pen-chan,
Ko-Pen-chan, Ko-Pen-chan, Ko-Pen-chan.

93
00:05:24,306 --> 00:05:27,146
Mirepen-chan was the only one who was
blown away.

94
00:05:27,146 --> 00:05:30,066
I'm the pen.

95
00:05:30,066 --> 00:05:34,426
The pen you write is a pen.

96
00:05:34,426 --> 00:05:37,706
This is a magic stick sand set.

97
00:05:37,706 --> 00:05:40,106
cute

98
00:05:40,106 --> 00:05:44,866
Ko-Pen-chan, who became a magician, is
floating in the cup.

99
00:05:44,866 --> 00:05:46,626
What?

100
00:05:46,626 --> 00:05:50,186
Underneath it, I imagined a magic stick.

101
00:05:50,186 --> 00:05:51,226
What was this?

102
00:05:51,226 --> 00:05:53,026
Was it a croquemush?

103
00:05:53,026 --> 00:05:54,666
It was very delicious.

104
00:05:54,666 --> 00:05:57,426
It's like a croquemush.

105
00:05:57,426 --> 00:05:59,066
What does that mean?

106
00:05:59,066 --> 00:06:01,946
It's a stick.

107
00:06:01,946 --> 00:06:05,426
Next, Mirepen ate this.

108
00:06:05,426 --> 00:06:08,426
Heart-pounding, indescribable curry.

109
00:06:08,426 --> 00:06:10,546
It looks delicious.

110
00:06:10,546 --> 00:06:14,426
This is full of vegetables.

111
00:06:14,426 --> 00:06:22,746
There is a spice that has a magic that
makes you feel energetic.

112
00:06:22,746 --> 00:06:26,226
If you eat it together, your heart will
be warm and indescribable.

113
00:06:26,226 --> 00:06:32,946
This curry is a little spicy.

114
00:06:32,946 --> 00:06:40,466
I wondered what this rice was made of
when Ko-Pen-chan was born.

115
00:06:40,466 --> 00:06:44,106
The color was very delicious.

116
00:06:44,106 --> 00:06:48,226
Next, we ate dessert.

117
00:06:48,226 --> 00:06:52,066
Ko-Pen ate this.

118
00:06:52,066 --> 00:06:55,066
Ko-Pen-chan man, the magic of
friendship.

119
00:06:55,066 --> 00:06:58,066
This was an anman.

120
00:06:58,066 --> 00:07:02,986
I felt nostalgic.

121
00:07:02,986 --> 00:07:07,946
It was like a childhood friend.

122
00:07:07,946 --> 00:07:11,066
The anman was very delicious.

123
00:07:11,066 --> 00:07:12,666
I ate it very deliciously.

124
00:07:12,666 --> 00:07:13,746
It was very delicious.

125
00:07:13,746 --> 00:07:16,586
I wondered where to start.

126
00:07:16,586 --> 00:07:18,986
I feel sad.

127
00:07:18,986 --> 00:07:20,786
I started with no pen.

128
00:07:20,786 --> 00:07:23,546
I started with no pen.

129
00:07:23,546 --> 00:07:25,946
Mirepen ate this.

130
00:07:25,946 --> 00:07:29,386
This is Ko-Pen-chan's birthday cake.

131
00:07:29,386 --> 00:07:32,626
Ko-Pen-chan's birthday was on April 4th.

132
00:07:32,626 --> 00:07:34,906
I ordered this.

133
00:07:34,906 --> 00:07:39,426
This is a muffin coated with white
chocolate.

134
00:07:39,426 --> 00:07:43,074
There is a strawberry on the side.

135
00:07:43,074 --> 00:07:45,074
It looks delicious

136
00:07:45,074 --> 00:07:48,574
What do you think this is made of?

137
00:07:48,574 --> 00:07:50,074
Magic

138
00:07:50,074 --> 00:07:53,074
What a fantasy

139
00:07:53,074 --> 00:07:55,074
The correct answer was black sesame

140
00:07:55,074 --> 00:07:57,074
It was black sesame ice cream

141
00:07:57,074 --> 00:08:00,074
This ice cream is very delicious

142
00:08:00,074 --> 00:08:04,074
I ate the plate of the previous salad

143
00:08:04,074 --> 00:08:07,074
I was on the plate

144
00:08:07,074 --> 00:08:10,074
This black sesame ice cream was
refreshing and delicious

145
00:08:10,074 --> 00:08:13,074
The white chocolate was also crispy

146
00:08:13,074 --> 00:08:16,074
This was a nice birthday cake

147
00:08:16,074 --> 00:08:18,074
Happy birthday

148
00:08:18,074 --> 00:08:20,074
This is pink copen

149
00:08:20,074 --> 00:08:22,074
Magic soda

150
00:08:22,074 --> 00:08:24,074
It's cute

151
00:08:24,074 --> 00:08:29,074
The pink part is jelly

152
00:08:29,074 --> 00:08:32,074
It was sweet and sour and delicious

153
00:08:32,074 --> 00:08:35,074
There is whipped cream on it

154
00:08:35,074 --> 00:08:40,074
Copen is floating on it

155
00:08:40,074 --> 00:08:43,074
It was a cute drink

156
00:08:43,074 --> 00:08:47,074
I ordered the magic soda

157
00:08:47,074 --> 00:08:51,074
The blue one was the color

158
00:08:51,074 --> 00:08:54,074
I was surprised

159
00:08:54,074 --> 00:08:58,074
It was very refreshing

160
00:08:58,074 --> 00:09:02,074
I thought it was a waste to eat the ice
cream

161
00:09:02,074 --> 00:09:04,074
It was sinking

162
00:09:04,074 --> 00:09:08,074
The soda candy was on the bottom

163
00:09:08,074 --> 00:09:10,074
Soda

164
00:09:10,074 --> 00:09:14,074
The soda candy was on the bottom

165
00:09:14,074 --> 00:09:19,074
I went to the cafe

166
00:09:19,074 --> 00:09:22,074
I went to the cafe

167
00:09:22,074 --> 00:09:26,074
I went to the cafe

168
00:09:26,074 --> 00:09:29,074
I went to the cafe

169
00:09:29,074 --> 00:09:31,074
I enjoyed the coffee

170
00:09:31,074 --> 00:09:33,074
It was delicious

171
00:09:33,074 --> 00:09:37,074
I was happy

172
00:09:37,074 --> 00:09:41,074
It was delicious

173
00:09:41,074 --> 00:09:43,074
I ate

174
00:09:43,074 --> 00:09:46,074
I ate

175
00:09:46,074 --> 00:09:51,074
I went to the cafe

176
00:09:51,074 --> 00:09:56,074
There is a cute guy floating

177
00:09:56,074 --> 00:09:58,074
Cute

178
00:09:58,074 --> 00:10:04,074
He is good at touching

179
00:10:04,074 --> 00:10:07,074
He is good at touching

180
00:10:07,074 --> 00:10:09,074
He praises me

181
00:10:09,074 --> 00:10:12,074
It was a happy world

182
00:10:12,074 --> 00:10:16,074
The food was delicious

183
00:10:16,074 --> 00:10:20,074
We ordered a lot

184
00:10:20,074 --> 00:10:22,530
I was hungry

185
00:10:22,530 --> 00:10:29,730
We ate the drinks, desserts, and main
dishes.

186
00:10:29,730 --> 00:10:30,730
It was delicious.

187
00:10:30,730 --> 00:10:31,730
It was delicious.

00:10:32,730 --> 00:10:37,430
It was very cruel to eat Kopen-chan.

00:10:38,430 --> 00:10:44,830
It was a Kopen-chan Cafe.

192
00:10:44,830 --> 00:10:50,730
Everyone who watched it was great.

I will introduce the purchase date.

194
00:10:56,130 --> 00:10:58,730
First of all,

197
00:11:09,330 --> 00:11:15,530
It can be used as a doll.

198
00:11:15,530 --> 00:11:20,530
I will take Kopen-chan to the store when
I buy a mille-pain.

199
00:11:20,530 --> 00:11:21,530
I will take Kopen-chan to the store.

It's cute.

205
00:11:42,530 --> 00:11:47,530
It's comfortable because the part where
the fingers are inserted is fluffy.

206
00:11:47,530 --> 00:11:51,530
What does this say?

207
00:11:51,530 --> 00:11:55,530
It says,

208
00:11:55,530 --> 00:11:59,530
I'm watching you always working hard.

209
00:11:59,530 --> 00:12:01,530
I thought it was this.

210
00:12:01,530 --> 00:12:02,530

It's fluffy and comfortable.

227
00:12:59,530 --> 00:13:01,530
I want to put a lot of it on my face.

228
00:13:01,530 --> 00:13:04,530
I'm sure you can see the big one in the
live.

00:16:06,546 --> 00:16:12,706
Don't open it so easily.

281
00:16:12,706 --> 00:16:16,746
