WEBVTT

00:00.140 --> 00:01.620
 But before that, let's go to the next
one!

00:01.620 --> 00:07.866
 Then challenge live broadcast!

00:07.866 --> 00:11.866
 That's my main job.

00:11.866 --> 00:15.866
 Have you ever thought about live
streaming?

00:15.866 --> 00:19.866
 I often watch sports programs.

00:19.866 --> 00:22.866
 It's a must for sports programs.

00:22.866 --> 00:26.866
 The biggest difference from reading
script is that there is no script in
live streaming.

00:26.866 --> 00:32.866
 This is good for people who are not
good at reading script.

00:32.866 --> 00:34.866
 You don't have to follow it with your
eyes.

00:34.866 --> 00:36.866
 You can say what you like.

00:36.866 --> 00:40.866
 But you have to express your feelings
while watching something.

00:40.866 --> 00:44.866
 You need to bring the words in your
head quickly.

00:44.866 --> 00:46.866
 You need to be fast.

00:46.866 --> 00:50.866
 You said that you can read the script
slowly.

00:50.866 --> 00:53.866
 But you need to be fast when you read
the script.

00:56.680 --> 01:01.680
 When you see something, you should
bring the best word.

01:02.680 --> 01:07.680
 If you don't have the best word, you
should bring the closest word, better.

01:08.680 --> 01:11.680
 We have two videos.

01:12.680 --> 01:15.680
 I will show you.

01:15.680 --> 01:22.680
 This is the video of the one-man live
that was held at the Saitama Super Arena
on August 23, last year.

01:22.680 --> 01:31.386
 I will show you the video.

01:31.386 --> 01:35.546
 Next we will show you these trifecta of
idols.

01:35.786 --> 01:37.846
 Let's see!

01:37.846 --> 01:39.386
 Chow circuit.

01:39.504 --> 01:42.704
 Now, the forest car race is about to
begin.

01:42.704 --> 01:43.904
 There are no customers.

01:43.904 --> 01:45.704
 Saitama Super Arena has started.

01:45.704 --> 01:47.704
 Now, Sakai will go from inside.

01:47.704 --> 01:48.904
 Sakai goes first.

01:48.904 --> 01:49.704
 Sakai is in the lead.

01:49.704 --> 01:50.704
 And Tsujino from the outside.

01:50.704 --> 01:51.704
 Sakai and Tsujino.

01:51.704 --> 01:53.704
 This is a one-on-one situation.

01:53.704 --> 01:55.104
 Anne is late.

01:55.104 --> 01:55.704
 How about it?

01:55.704 --> 01:57.104
 Tsujino. Anne is late.

01:57.104 --> 01:57.704
 You're late.

01:57.704 --> 01:58.504
 Now, one-on-one.

01:58.504 --> 01:59.704
 Tsujino and Sakai's one-on-one.

01:59.704 --> 02:00.904
 How about the first one?

02:01.904 --> 02:05.304
 Is this Sakai or Tsujino?

02:05.704 --> 02:07.104
 It's a close game.

02:07.104 --> 02:11.104
 Anne is trying to reach the goal.

02:11.104 --> 02:12.704
 She is the only one behind.

02:12.704 --> 02:16.304
 She is trying to reach the goal.

02:17.504 --> 02:18.704
 She is clapping.

02:18.704 --> 02:21.304
 She is clapping from a place where no
one is.

02:21.304 --> 02:22.704
 She is the last one behind.

02:22.704 --> 02:24.104
 She is the last one behind.

02:24.104 --> 02:24.704
 How about it?

02:24.704 --> 02:26.704
 Wow!

02:28.704 --> 02:29.704
 Wow!

02:29.704 --> 02:31.104
 It's like watching a TV show.

02:31.104 --> 02:32.104
 It's like watching a TV show.

02:32.104 --> 02:33.104
 It's like watching a TV show.

02:33.104 --> 02:34.104
 Wow!

02:34.104 --> 02:37.104
 You're late.

02:37.104 --> 02:38.104
 You're late.

02:38.104 --> 02:39.104
 You're late.

02:40.104 --> 02:42.104
 That's it.

02:42.104 --> 02:44.104
 I want you to do this.

02:44.104 --> 02:45.104
 What?

02:45.104 --> 02:47.104
 I've never done this.

02:47.104 --> 02:52.104
 So, please look at the picture and
choose the appropriate words.

02:52.104 --> 02:57.552
 Make the final decision following the
viewer's participation.

02:58.552 --> 03:02.552
 This program is a program where 6
people who are active to promote
something exciting

03:02.552 --> 03:31.552
 challenge various things and raise the
excitement barometer in the world.

03:32.552 --> 03:33.776
 Thank you for watching.

03:34.776 --> 03:37.776
 First, I'd like the three of us to do
it.

03:37.776 --> 03:41.776
 Sakai, Koizumi, and Yurushika.

03:41.776 --> 03:43.776
 Let's start with Sakai.

03:43.776 --> 03:47.776
 I'll do my best.

03:47.776 --> 03:58.776
 Sakai's commentary start!

03:59.472 --> 04:02.112
 Now, the obstacle relay is about to
start.

04:02.112 --> 04:03.512
 Ah! It's started!

04:03.512 --> 04:05.712
 It seems that Hyurin is leading.

04:05.712 --> 04:09.832
 I thought Koizumi-san was a little
behind, but...

04:09.832 --> 04:10.712
 Oh!

04:10.712 --> 04:11.952
 Next is the cardboard...

04:11.952 --> 04:14.432
 The cardboard roll relay has started!

04:14.432 --> 04:17.072
 Ah! Hyurin is struggling to get in.

04:17.072 --> 04:19.872
 Ah! She's been torn apart, but what
will happen?

04:19.872 --> 04:24.032
 Ah! Tsudaaki-san started first, but...

04:24.032 --> 04:25.832
 Oharu is behind, but...

04:25.832 --> 04:27.232
 Oh! They collided!

04:27.232 --> 04:29.992
 Hyurin and Aki-chan collided!

04:29.992 --> 04:32.472
 What will happen in this battle?

04:32.472 --> 04:33.672
 Ah, the three of them are cute today...

04:33.672 --> 04:34.432
 Ah!

04:34.432 --> 04:37.472
 Next is the big ball rolling relay!

04:37.472 --> 04:39.152
 What will happen?

04:39.152 --> 04:41.952
 Oh! Tsuda-san is overwhelmingly
leading, but...

04:41.952 --> 04:44.072
 Where are the other two?

04:44.072 --> 04:46.752
 Koizumi-san is catching up to Hyurin.

04:46.752 --> 04:47.952
 Oh!

04:47.952 --> 04:51.392
 Next is the balloon inflating battle.

04:51.392 --> 04:54.472
 Will Tsuda-san be able to break it
quickly because he was first?

04:54.472 --> 04:57.832
 Yoshikawa-san's way of inflating is
pretty good.

04:57.832 --> 04:58.952
 It's stable.

04:58.952 --> 05:03.672
 Koizumi-san is a little behind, so it's
going to take a long time.

05:03.672 --> 05:06.472
 Her hair is also quite messy.

05:06.472 --> 05:08.992
 Oh! Tsuda-san and Yoshikawa-san are
about the same...

05:08.992 --> 05:11.592
 Ah! Tsuda-san broke it first!

05:11.592 --> 05:13.992
 Tsuda-san is the goal!

05:13.992 --> 05:17.672
 Next is the battle between Koizumi-san
and Yoshikawa-san.

05:17.672 --> 05:20.272
 Oh! Which one will break first?

05:20.272 --> 05:22.312
 Oh! Yoshikawa-san broke it first!

05:22.312 --> 05:25.872
 So...

05:25.872 --> 05:27.912
 Yes! Yoshikawa-san is the goal!

05:27.912 --> 05:31.272
 So, the first place is Aki-chan, and
the second place is Hyurin-san!

05:31.272 --> 05:33.232
 It was a good result!

05:33.232 --> 05:34.552
 Thank you!

05:34.552 --> 05:37.592
 Please give it to Sakai-san!

05:37.592 --> 05:41.432
 Now, here is Sakai-san's live
commentary judgment!

05:41.432 --> 05:43.032
 Oh!

05:43.032 --> 05:44.032
 Great!

05:44.032 --> 05:45.032
 It's interesting!

05:45.032 --> 05:47.752
 She explained the game properly in her
head.

05:47.752 --> 05:49.912
 She told me that there is such a game.

05:49.912 --> 05:53.112
 She said, like, it's cute today, too.

05:53.112 --> 05:53.632
 I was saying that.

05:53.632 --> 05:55.872
 It's really good to put that in.

05:55.872 --> 05:59.552
 And she said that she messed up her
hair.

05:59.552 --> 06:01.232
 I can see that.

06:01.232 --> 06:02.832
 I can see her hard work.

06:02.832 --> 06:04.992
 That description is very good.

06:04.992 --> 06:08.112
 I was surprised at the high quality!

06:08.112 --> 06:11.672
 Sakai-san passed the live commentary!

06:11.672 --> 06:13.312
 Yay! Thank you!

06:13.312 --> 06:14.512
 It's amazing!

06:14.512 --> 06:15.952
 Thank you.

06:15.952 --> 06:17.992
 Next, Koizumi-san, please challenge!

06:17.992 --> 06:18.992
 I'll do my best!

06:18.992 --> 06:19.992
 Yes!

06:21.658 --> 06:28.118
 How would Koizumi skating be

06:28.118 --> 06:31.058
 Let's get started!

06:34.394 --> 06:38.394
 The three-person race is about to
start.

06:38.394 --> 06:42.394
 Sakai is leading.

06:42.394 --> 06:44.394
 Good luck to all three.

06:44.394 --> 06:45.394
 Tsujino is also.

06:45.394 --> 06:46.394
 Where is An-san?

06:46.394 --> 06:47.394
 An-san!

06:47.394 --> 06:49.394
 An-san is a little behind.

06:49.394 --> 06:50.394
 An-san, good luck.

06:50.394 --> 06:52.394
 An-san's smile is the strongest.

06:52.394 --> 06:55.394
 Tsujino and Sakai, which one will win?

06:55.394 --> 06:58.394
 Tsujino leads in the near car.

06:58.394 --> 06:59.394
 He made a goal.

06:59.394 --> 07:05.394
 An-san is pushed by Tamarin and is
heading to the goal.

07:05.394 --> 07:08.394
 Tamarin is also cheering for An-san
with a good smile.

07:08.394 --> 07:10.394
 Tamarin's support is hot.

07:10.394 --> 07:12.394
 He will soon reach the goal.

07:12.394 --> 07:13.394
 An-san, good luck.

07:13.394 --> 07:14.394
 An-san is soon...

07:14.394 --> 07:19.760
 An-san just reached the goal.

07:19.760 --> 07:23.760
 Thank you for the great performance!

07:25.178 --> 07:27.178
 I tend to stretch my neck.

07:29.178 --> 07:31.178
 I'm glad I felt it myself.

07:33.178 --> 07:37.178
 Now, this is Koizumi's commentary
technique.

07:37.178 --> 07:38.178
 It's here.

07:38.178 --> 07:39.178
 It's amazing.

07:39.178 --> 07:40.178
 It was amazing.

07:40.178 --> 07:41.178
 It's good.

07:42.178 --> 07:46.178
 There was a proper explanation of the
game, and then the situation.

07:46.178 --> 07:49.178
 Who is in the lead and who is behind.

07:49.178 --> 07:51.178
 There was also a part where I was
cheering on the way.

07:51.178 --> 07:54.178
 That was a little good.

07:54.178 --> 07:57.178
 At the end, Tsujima and Sakai were
lined up.

07:57.178 --> 07:58.178
 They said,

07:58.178 --> 08:00.178
 And Publin.

08:00.178 --> 08:02.178
 I didn't know at all.

08:02.178 --> 08:04.178
 I didn't know the name, so I couldn't
say it.

08:04.178 --> 08:07.178
 I know that, so I said the name
properly.

08:07.178 --> 08:09.178
 I explained the situation.

08:09.178 --> 08:11.178
 I think this was well conveyed.

08:11.178 --> 08:12.178
 It's wonderful.

08:15.178 --> 08:18.178
 I have to say that word instantly.

08:18.178 --> 08:19.178
 It's hard.

08:19.178 --> 08:20.178
 I can't say it.

08:20.178 --> 08:24.178
 But you're much better than reading the
manuscript.

08:27.048 --> 08:29.048
 Ah, I see.

08:30.048 --> 08:32.048
 Now, let's have Yoshikawa-san for the
last.

08:33.048 --> 08:34.048
 Thank you.

08:35.048 --> 08:36.048
 But, you're good at it.

08:36.048 --> 08:38.048
 I'm better at it.

08:41.920 --> 08:47.920
 Let's start Yoshikawa's commentary.

08:47.920 --> 08:50.920
 Yoshikawa Hyo is in the second half.

08:50.920 --> 08:54.920
 What will happen in this game?

08:54.920 --> 08:58.920
 The three of them are cute today.

08:58.920 --> 09:00.920
 The three of them will start the race.

09:00.920 --> 09:01.920
 Start!

09:01.920 --> 09:06.920
 The first one to start is Sakai.

09:06.920 --> 09:09.920
 Anne is a little late.

09:09.920 --> 09:11.920
 Tamarin is coming out.

09:11.920 --> 09:13.920
 It's a fierce battle.

09:13.920 --> 09:15.920
 Anne's smile is cute.

09:15.920 --> 09:19.920
 Sakai is spreading her legs.

09:19.920 --> 09:20.920
 It's a good feeling.

09:20.920 --> 09:22.920
 She just finished.

09:22.920 --> 09:25.920
 Pamulin is leading Anne.

09:25.920 --> 09:33.920
 It's been 20 years since the race
started.

09:33.920 --> 09:37.920
 I can see two people in the back.

09:37.920 --> 09:40.920
 Anne finished.

09:40.920 --> 09:41.920
 Congratulations.

09:41.920 --> 09:44.920
 The three of them were impressed by the
hot battle.

09:44.920 --> 09:46.920
 Thank you very much.

09:46.920 --> 09:48.920
 Congratulations.

09:48.920 --> 09:50.920
 Congratulations.

09:50.920 --> 09:52.920
 I'm scared.

09:52.920 --> 09:54.920
 I'm glad.

09:54.920 --> 09:57.920
 I'm glad.

09:57.920 --> 10:03.744
 Let's start Yoshikawa's commentary.

10:03.744 --> 10:05.404
 Eh?

10:06.504 --> 10:08.504
 I could see that you were very excited.

10:10.504 --> 10:12.504
 But it's not a comment that you're too
excited.

10:14.504 --> 10:17.504
 I want you to look at it with a certain
degree of anxiety and proceed calmly.

10:18.504 --> 10:21.504
 The worst thing was that you didn't say
who was the first one.

10:24.504 --> 10:26.504
 You said that Anne was the last one to
reach the goal.

10:27.504 --> 10:30.504
 One, two, Tsujino, Sakai, which one, it
was a close game.

10:31.504 --> 10:33.504
 You didn't say that those two had
reached the goal.

10:33.504 --> 10:34.504
 You were very excited.

10:35.504 --> 10:36.504
 I was excited.

10:37.504 --> 10:39.504
 You should have held back your
excitement a little more.

10:44.504 --> 10:46.504
 It was a commentary of the best of the
best.

10:47.504 --> 10:49.504
 It was easy, but you all did it.

10:50.504 --> 10:51.504
 How was it?

10:52.504 --> 10:55.504
 It's difficult to say the words
instantly.

10:56.504 --> 11:01.504
 And I was a little surprised at how
little I knew the words.

11:01.504 --> 11:05.504
 I was able to say it because the video
changed while I was saying it.

11:06.504 --> 11:08.504
 You forgot about the previous one and
had to go to the next one.

11:09.504 --> 11:10.504
 This is also a feature of commentary.

11:10.504 --> 11:19.898
 That's all for today.

11:19.898 --> 11:26.858
uld have popular I a

11:27.904 --> 11:32.904
 I will show you the demonstration and
application of the game.

11:32.904 --> 11:38.904
 It is normal to show the movement of a
sports.

11:38.904 --> 11:42.904
 I will show you the game that does not
move.

11:42.904 --> 11:47.904
 For example, there is a small square
table in front of me.

11:47.904 --> 11:50.904
 A water bottle is on it.

11:50.904 --> 11:55.904
 It is said that 90% of the human body
is made of water.

11:55.904 --> 11:59.904
 I will show you the movement of the
water bottle.

11:59.904 --> 12:04.904
 I will show you the movement of the
water bottle.

12:04.904 --> 12:11.904
 I will show you the movement of the
water bottle.

12:11.904 --> 12:16.904
 If you can do this, you will be a
successful person.

12:16.904 --> 12:20.904
 No one has done it yet.

12:20.904 --> 12:25.904
 For example, you can do anything with a
water bottle.

12:25.904 --> 12:28.904
 Please tell me the date.

12:28.904 --> 12:31.904
 Please tell me the date.

12:31.904 --> 12:34.904
 How many days is it?

12:34.904 --> 12:39.904
 It is around March.

12:41.472 --> 12:44.832
 March 31st is the date.

12:44.832 --> 12:46.832
 It is the day before April 1st.

12:46.832 --> 12:53.712
 On April 1st, 1982, the final of the
MSG League was held at Kuramae National
Stadium.

12:53.712 --> 12:55.552
 It is the day before that.

12:55.552 --> 12:59.072
 At first, the first pitch of Antonio
Inoki and Andrew the Giant was decided.

12:59.072 --> 13:02.272
 Antonio Inoki injured his leg and was
urgently discharged.

13:02.272 --> 13:05.392
 There, Killer Curren's appearance as a
diamond was decided.

13:05.392 --> 13:09.152
 In other words, this March 31st is the
day after the announcement of the
appearance of the diamond.

13:09.152 --> 13:13.392
 It is the day that Killer Curren
arrived at the bedside while making a
throbbing sound.

13:17.904 --> 13:20.904
 I don't know, but if you say a lot,
it's amazing.

13:20.904 --> 13:21.904
 This is it.

13:21.904 --> 13:23.904
 If you say something like this,

13:23.904 --> 13:24.904
 I see.

13:24.904 --> 13:25.904
 What?

13:25.904 --> 13:28.904
 I think you didn't know what you were
saying at all.

13:28.904 --> 13:29.904
 Killer turn.

13:29.904 --> 13:30.904
 I see.

13:30.904 --> 13:31.904
 I see.

13:33.904 --> 13:34.904
 I see.

13:34.904 --> 13:38.904
 I would like you to challenge everyone
like that.

13:38.904 --> 13:42.904
 Then, let's have the three people who
didn't do it earlier challenge.

13:42.904 --> 13:45.904
 Let's start with Tsuruno.

13:45.904 --> 13:47.904
 Yes.

13:49.306 --> 14:06.306
 Please subscribe to my channel!

14:06.490 --> 14:08.490
 Ah, then I'll take this one.

14:08.490 --> 14:09.490
 I'll take one more.

14:09.490 --> 14:10.490
 Yes, you chose one.

14:10.490 --> 14:16.490
 Well then, Ms. Sujino, please do a
30-second live broadcast.

14:16.490 --> 14:21.490
 Yes, today I would like to introduce
this live photo of the 7th issue.

14:21.490 --> 14:23.490
 I will pick up one of them.

14:23.490 --> 14:24.490
 Ta-da!

14:24.490 --> 14:26.490
 This is number 265!

14:26.490 --> 14:28.544
 It's over here.

14:29.544 --> 14:31.544
 This is Hitoka Sakai of Tokimeki Red!

14:31.544 --> 14:34.544
 How do you like this sparkling smile?

14:34.544 --> 14:38.544
 People who see this smile will
definitely be excited!

14:38.544 --> 14:44.544
 Hitoka Sakai's photo book will be
released on February 28th!

14:44.544 --> 14:46.544
 You will definitely fall in love!

14:47.544 --> 14:49.544
 Thank you!

14:49.544 --> 14:51.544
 I was promoting it.

14:51.544 --> 14:53.544
 That's it.

14:53.544 --> 14:57.544
 Let's judge Tsujino's comment.

14:57.544 --> 14:59.544
 It's over!

15:00.544 --> 15:03.544
 It's different when you speak with your
own words.

15:03.544 --> 15:07.544
 I don't have to read it with my eyes.

15:07.544 --> 15:11.544
 I could feel that you wanted to convey
the goodness of Sakai.

15:11.544 --> 15:17.544
 If you say more about the contents of
the photo, it will be even better.

15:17.544 --> 15:19.544
 It's surprisingly 30 seconds.

15:19.544 --> 15:21.544
 It's a good feeling.

15:21.544 --> 15:23.544
 You don't have time to think.

15:23.544 --> 15:25.544
 You should go on.

15:25.544 --> 15:27.544
 I think it was good.

15:27.544 --> 15:29.544
 Next, let's see An's comment.

15:33.626 --> 15:35.626
 What will you choose?

15:36.626 --> 15:38.626
 What will you choose?

15:38.626 --> 15:40.626
 I'll choose a nice shirt.

15:47.696 --> 15:50.336
 Let's start the live stream of An-san.

15:50.336 --> 15:51.336
 Start!

15:51.336 --> 15:57.536
 Everyone, the T-shirt I'm wearing is a
goods T-shirt of Super Tokimeki Channel.

15:57.536 --> 16:00.036
 There are six cute girls here.

16:00.036 --> 16:05.536
 This is an illustration of the members
of Super Tokimeki Channel.

16:05.536 --> 16:07.536
 And this looks pretty flashy, right?

16:07.536 --> 16:09.036
 But that's not true.

16:09.036 --> 16:12.036
 It's a nice T-shirt that you can wear
casually.

16:12.036 --> 16:15.036
 This T-shirt has a hidden story.

16:15.036 --> 16:22.036
 This T-shirt is the T-shirt I wore in
my birthday party in January this year.

16:22.036 --> 16:25.036
 I'm wearing this T-shirt in the live
photo.

16:25.036 --> 16:29.036
 So when this T-shirt is released, it's
a spoiler.

16:29.036 --> 16:30.036
 Everyone, surprised!

16:30.036 --> 16:31.036
 Wow!

16:31.036 --> 16:33.036
 It's a spoiler.

16:35.036 --> 16:37.036
 Please sit down.

16:39.036 --> 16:40.036
 Let's get started.

16:40.036 --> 16:42.036
 This is the live stream of An-san.

16:42.036 --> 16:45.036
 This is the evaluation of An-san's live
stream.

16:46.036 --> 16:48.036
 I'm glad you read the manuscript.

16:49.036 --> 16:52.036
 It was like TV shopping.

16:54.036 --> 16:55.036
 Certainly.

16:55.036 --> 17:01.036
 I know it's highly recommended, but I'd
like you to spread it more from this
T-shirt.

17:01.036 --> 17:07.036
 I wish you could say more about the
shape and so on.

17:08.036 --> 17:09.036
 It's strange.

17:09.036 --> 17:09.344
 I'm glad you read it.

17:10.344 --> 17:12.344
 It's not like a manuscript.

17:13.344 --> 17:15.344
 Let's have Suda-san for the last.

17:15.344 --> 17:17.344
 Good luck!

17:24.368 --> 17:26.368
 What do you want to do?

17:26.368 --> 17:28.368
 I want to go with hair accessories.

17:28.368 --> 17:30.368
 The time limit is 30 seconds.

17:30.368 --> 17:32.368
 Start the live broadcast of Suda-san!

17:32.368 --> 17:34.368
 Hello everyone!

17:34.368 --> 17:37.368
 First of all, please look at this
colorful hair accessory!

17:37.368 --> 17:42.368
 This hair accessory is a hair accessory
of the costume of Ennis.

17:42.368 --> 17:48.368
 Everyone has a flower motif, and it has
matching beads.

17:48.368 --> 17:52.368
 If you wear this, you will feel happy.

17:52.368 --> 17:57.368
 I'm yellow, so I always wear this and
I'm a friend of the live broadcast.

17:57.368 --> 17:59.368
 This is my friend!

17:59.368 --> 18:03.368
 Everyone, please make a makeup and wear
it!

18:10.368 --> 18:14.368
 This is the evaluation of Suda-san's
comment.

18:16.368 --> 18:18.368
 It was a good 30 seconds.

18:18.368 --> 18:22.368
 Did you draw it in detail?

18:22.368 --> 18:24.368
 I drew it with a pencil.

18:26.368 --> 18:28.368
 It was full of feelings you wanted to
see.

18:28.368 --> 18:37.368
 Overall, it was a TV shopping, but I
could see that you wanted to convey the
goodness.

18:37.368 --> 18:43.368
 I also put in a lot of things like how
to use it and how to use it, not just
the shape.

18:43.368 --> 18:46.368
 I'm glad that there was originality in
that area.

18:46.368 --> 18:52.368
 The point when you broadcast is to say
the sentence as short as possible.

18:52.368 --> 18:56.368
 I'm in Shibuya right now.

18:56.368 --> 18:58.368
 There are a lot of people.

18:58.368 --> 19:00.368
 It's sunny.

19:00.368 --> 19:01.368
 The sky is very blue.

19:01.368 --> 19:03.368
 The blue sky is spreading.

19:03.368 --> 19:07.368
 It's easy to understand that it's
short.

19:07.368 --> 19:13.368
 I came to Shibuya, but there are a lot
of people.

19:13.368 --> 19:20.368
 If you say that the sky is very blue,
it's a long sentence.

19:20.368 --> 19:23.368
 Instead, let's say it in a short
sentence.

19:23.368 --> 19:26.368
 Suda-san, you did it.

19:26.368 --> 19:31.360
 I passed!

19:31.360 --> 19:36.360
 So, this time we have a guest, Kiyoma
Shiguchi from FreeAnimals.

19:36.360 --> 19:39.360
 He will be our voice actor.

19:39.360 --> 19:41.360
 What do you think, Kiyoma-san?

19:41.360 --> 19:45.360
 Well, I think you guys aren't suited to
read scripts.

19:46.360 --> 19:47.360
 You should do it freely.

19:48.360 --> 19:49.360
 I see.

19:49.360 --> 19:53.360
 We started this project with KageNare,
but you should do it freely.

19:53.360 --> 19:54.360
 Without any script.

19:54.360 --> 19:56.360
 KageNare is also free.

19:56.360 --> 19:57.360
 Without any script.

19:57.360 --> 19:59.360
 Without any script, you can do it
freely.

19:59.360 --> 20:00.360
 I see.

20:00.360 --> 20:02.360
 You should keep in mind that you should
read the script.

20:02.360 --> 20:04.360
 I think it's better to do it freely.

20:05.360 --> 20:06.360
 I see.

20:07.360 --> 20:09.360
 Please follow my lead.

20:09.360 --> 20:10.360
 Yes!

20:11.360 --> 20:14.360
 We will do our best!

20:15.360 --> 20:16.360
 Thank you very much!

20:16.360 --> 20:17.360
 Thank you!

20:17.360 --> 20:21.360
 See you next week!

20:23.664 --> 20:27.664
 If you like today's narration,

20:27.664 --> 20:33.664
 if you like the live streaming of our
song,

20:33.664 --> 20:37.664
 if you like our hair style,

20:37.664 --> 20:41.664
 if you want to see our daily life,

20:41.664 --> 20:44.664
 if you want to try narration,

20:44.664 --> 20:48.664
 if you want to see our next live
performance,

20:48.664 --> 20:54.664
 please like and subscribe to our
channel!

20:54.664 --> 20:56.664
 Leave comments too!

20:56.664 --> 20:58.664
 Bye bye!

21:24.474 --> 21:29.474
 Now I can do it, even if it's tears

21:29.474 --> 21:33.474
 When I'm lost, I remember right away

21:33.474 --> 21:37.474
 Even if it rains, I'll smile

21:37.474 --> 21:41.474
 Look, let's go anywhere

21:41.474 --> 21:45.474
 Goodbye, goodbye, to me of yesterday

21:45.474 --> 21:49.474
 The city after the rain is sparkling

21:49.474 --> 21:53.474
 My heart is like a sunny day, the sound
of the puddle of water

21:53.474 --> 21:57.474
 I'll play the rainbow piano

21:57.474 --> 22:02.474
 Goodbye, goodbye, to me of yesterday

22:02.474 --> 22:06.474
 The city after the rain is sparkling

22:06.474 --> 22:10.474
 My heart is like a sunny day, the sound
of the puddle of water

22:10.474 --> 22:34.474
 I'll wear a rainbow dress
