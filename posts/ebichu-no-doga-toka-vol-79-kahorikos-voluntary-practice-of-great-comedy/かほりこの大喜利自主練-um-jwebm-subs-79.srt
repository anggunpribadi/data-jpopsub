1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Ebichu's video

2
00:00:06,140 --> 00:00:09,640
Kawaii Kono Oogiri-chi training

3
00:00:09,640 --> 00:00:13,140
What was the last thing you did?

4
00:00:13,140 --> 00:00:15,140
Ebichu Tastas

5
00:00:15,140 --> 00:00:17,140
Ebichu Tastas

6
00:00:17,140 --> 00:00:20,140
I often do Oogiri

7
00:00:20,140 --> 00:00:26,140
At that time, I was playing together
with the picture

8
00:00:26,140 --> 00:00:30,140
I was born in the year of the dog

9
00:00:30,140 --> 00:00:35,140
I was really heavy

10
00:00:35,140 --> 00:00:38,140
I was really tired

11
00:00:38,140 --> 00:00:41,140
What was the last thing you did?

12
00:00:41,140 --> 00:00:43,140
What was the last thing you did?

13
00:00:43,140 --> 00:00:45,140
What was the last thing you did?

14
00:00:45,140 --> 00:00:47,162
What was the last thing you did?

15
00:00:47,162 --> 00:00:50,162
Mayama today is fake.

16
00:00:52,162 --> 00:00:53,162
Yes.

17
00:00:53,162 --> 00:00:54,162
Yes.

18
00:00:54,162 --> 00:00:56,162
Mayama today is fake.

19
00:00:56,162 --> 00:00:58,162
Why do you think so?

20
00:00:58,162 --> 00:01:01,162
Mayama in the past is different from
now.

21
00:01:01,162 --> 00:01:03,162
Because I dressed up.

22
00:01:04,162 --> 00:01:08,162
Mayama now is like Bob.

23
00:01:08,162 --> 00:01:10,162
It's similar.

24
00:01:10,162 --> 00:01:11,162
Wait, wait.

25
00:01:11,162 --> 00:01:13,162
It may be the same as high school
students.

26
00:01:13,162 --> 00:01:17,162
Mayama in the past is different from
now.

27
00:01:17,162 --> 00:01:20,162
Mayama in the past is different from
now.

28
00:01:22,162 --> 00:01:24,162
It's like this.

29
00:01:24,162 --> 00:01:26,162
It's like this.

30
00:01:31,162 --> 00:01:33,162
Let's change it.

31
00:01:33,162 --> 00:01:34,162
Yes.

32
00:01:34,162 --> 00:01:35,162
How is it?

33
00:01:35,162 --> 00:01:37,162
Why is it fake?

34
00:01:37,162 --> 00:01:40,162
Mayama is 180cm tall.

35
00:01:40,162 --> 00:01:43,162
It's like a high school student's boot.

36
00:01:46,162 --> 00:01:48,162
Mayama is Rika.

37
00:01:48,162 --> 00:01:50,162
Shin-san is Rika.

38
00:01:50,162 --> 00:01:52,162
It's fake.

39
00:01:56,162 --> 00:01:58,162
What is this?

40
00:02:00,162 --> 00:02:01,162
Wait.

41
00:02:07,162 --> 00:02:09,162
What are you trying to write?

42
00:02:09,162 --> 00:02:11,162
The next question.

43
00:02:11,162 --> 00:02:14,162
What is the next question?

44
00:02:16,162 --> 00:02:18,162
What is it?

45
00:02:18,162 --> 00:02:20,162
Is it true?

46
00:02:27,162 --> 00:02:29,162
It's your father.

47
00:02:31,162 --> 00:02:34,162
You laughed at the same time.

48
00:02:34,162 --> 00:02:36,162
No.

49
00:02:36,162 --> 00:02:39,162
I laughed at the same time.

50
00:02:39,162 --> 00:02:41,162
I laughed at the same time.

51
00:02:42,162 --> 00:02:44,162
Shoryu.

52
00:02:45,162 --> 00:02:47,162
You are good at it.

53
00:02:47,162 --> 00:02:49,162
You are good at it.

54
00:02:50,162 --> 00:02:52,162
I don't want to do it anymore.

55
00:02:52,162 --> 00:02:54,162
Let's go to the next question.

56
00:02:54,162 --> 00:02:57,162
What is the next question?

57
00:02:57,162 --> 00:03:00,162
What?

58
00:03:01,162 --> 00:03:03,162
What is this?

59
00:03:03,162 --> 00:03:05,162
Which one?

60
00:03:05,162 --> 00:03:07,162
Which one?

61
00:03:07,162 --> 00:03:09,162
Which one?

62
00:03:13,162 --> 00:03:15,162
What is it?

63
00:03:15,162 --> 00:03:18,882
Foundation.

64
00:03:18,882 --> 00:03:20,882
I'm scared.

65
00:03:22,882 --> 00:03:24,882
I'm still going to do it.

66
00:03:24,882 --> 00:03:26,882
What is it?

67
00:03:28,882 --> 00:03:30,882
Pink.

68
00:03:30,882 --> 00:03:32,882
You're using a lot of paper.

69
00:03:32,882 --> 00:03:35,882
What do you have?

70
00:03:35,882 --> 00:03:40,882
I'm sorry.

71
00:03:40,882 --> 00:03:43,882
I'm sorry.

72
00:03:43,882 --> 00:03:47,882
Is your house pink too?

73
00:03:47,882 --> 00:03:50,882
You're laughing at me.

74
00:03:50,882 --> 00:03:53,882
I'm scared.

75
00:03:56,882 --> 00:03:58,882
I'm scared.

76
00:03:58,882 --> 00:04:01,882
I'm not confident.

77
00:04:01,882 --> 00:04:04,882
I'm scared.

78
00:04:04,882 --> 00:04:07,882
I'm scared.

79
00:04:07,882 --> 00:04:09,882
Is it Hina's Twitter?

80
00:04:09,882 --> 00:04:11,882
What are you whispering?

81
00:04:11,882 --> 00:04:13,882
I'm whispering.

82
00:04:13,882 --> 00:04:16,882
I'm whispering.

83
00:04:16,882 --> 00:04:19,882
I don't know.

84
00:04:19,882 --> 00:04:23,882
I'm scared of the live ham.

85
00:04:23,882 --> 00:04:25,882
What do you think?

86
00:04:25,882 --> 00:04:28,882
What do you think?

87
00:04:28,882 --> 00:04:32,882
What is the number of times you have
been on a date?

88
00:04:32,882 --> 00:04:36,882
I have been on a date 13 times.

89
00:04:40,882 --> 00:04:42,882
I'm scared.

90
00:04:44,882 --> 00:04:48,882
I'm not going to reveal it.

91
00:04:48,882 --> 00:04:51,882
I'm going to reveal it to myself.

92
00:04:51,882 --> 00:04:55,882
I'm going to be a serious解釈者.

93
00:04:55,882 --> 00:04:58,882
I'm going to reveal it to myself.

94
00:04:58,882 --> 00:05:06,170
I'm going to reveal it to myself.

95
00:05:06,170 --> 00:05:08,170
I'm scared to buy a hamster.

96
00:05:08,170 --> 00:05:10,170
I'm scared to buy a hamster.

97
00:05:10,170 --> 00:05:12,170
I'm scared to buy a hamster.

98
00:05:18,170 --> 00:05:20,170
I can still do it.

99
00:05:22,170 --> 00:05:24,170
I'm already tired.

100
00:05:28,170 --> 00:05:30,170
I can't run away.

101
00:05:32,170 --> 00:05:34,170
I'm thinking.

102
00:05:34,170 --> 00:05:36,170
I'm thinking.

103
00:05:37,170 --> 00:05:38,170
What's this?

104
00:05:46,170 --> 00:05:48,170
This is not delicious.

105
00:05:48,170 --> 00:05:50,170
This is not delicious.

106
00:05:52,170 --> 00:05:54,170
cut

107
00:05:54,170 --> 00:05:56,170
cut

108
00:05:56,170 --> 00:05:58,170
I'm sorry.

109
00:05:58,170 --> 00:06:00,170
I made a small hamster.

110
00:06:00,170 --> 00:06:03,170
I was born with it.

111
00:06:05,170 --> 00:06:08,170
What is your favorite food?

112
00:06:09,170 --> 00:06:11,170
Think about it yourself.

113
00:06:12,170 --> 00:06:15,170
What is your favorite food?

114
00:06:15,170 --> 00:06:17,170
Kazumi?

115
00:06:17,170 --> 00:06:20,170
It's not a cucumber.

116
00:06:21,170 --> 00:06:24,170
It's a suggestion.

117
00:06:24,170 --> 00:06:26,170
What? Original Gyoza?

118
00:06:26,170 --> 00:06:29,170
It's a suggestion.

119
00:06:29,170 --> 00:06:31,170
Original Gyoza?

120
00:06:32,170 --> 00:06:34,170
Is it a seed?

121
00:06:34,170 --> 00:06:36,170
Seeds are a seed.

122
00:06:37,170 --> 00:06:39,170
Gyoza that makes you insincere.

123
00:06:40,170 --> 00:06:43,170
She's very serious.

124
00:06:43,170 --> 00:06:45,170
She's very serious.

125
00:06:45,170 --> 00:06:47,170
She's very serious.

126
00:06:47,170 --> 00:06:49,170
She's a little insincere.

127
00:06:51,170 --> 00:06:54,170
I'm a little different from what I
thought.

128
00:06:54,170 --> 00:06:56,170
Let's crush the seeds with a stick.

129
00:06:56,170 --> 00:06:58,170
Let's put it in a jar and crush it with
a stick.

130
00:06:58,170 --> 00:07:00,170
Let's put it in the oil at the end.

131
00:07:02,170 --> 00:07:03,170
She's very serious.

132
00:07:03,170 --> 00:07:05,170
She's very serious.

133
00:07:06,170 --> 00:07:08,170
It's a suggestion.

134
00:07:08,170 --> 00:07:09,170
Two more questions.

135
00:07:10,170 --> 00:07:12,170
Is that all?

136
00:07:14,170 --> 00:07:16,170
Five more questions.

137
00:07:16,170 --> 00:07:18,170
Let's go.

138
00:07:19,170 --> 00:07:22,170
What is your favorite food?

139
00:07:22,170 --> 00:07:24,170
It's a zombie.

140
00:07:24,170 --> 00:07:26,170
But she's an idol.

141
00:07:32,170 --> 00:07:34,170
It's a suggestion.

142
00:07:34,170 --> 00:07:35,170
Zombie.

143
00:07:35,170 --> 00:07:37,794
The pose of her appearance is a zombie.

144
00:07:37,794 --> 00:07:38,794
This is it.

145
00:07:40,114 --> 00:07:41,114
What about the idol?

146
00:07:41,114 --> 00:07:44,114
You are an idol.

147
00:07:44,114 --> 00:07:46,114
You are a good idol.

148
00:07:51,794 --> 00:07:54,794
I'm scared of her face, but her legs are
very beautiful.

149
00:07:54,794 --> 00:07:55,794
She is very beautiful.

150
00:07:55,794 --> 00:08:05,018
Thank you for watching.

151
00:08:05,018 --> 00:08:09,018
This is when Kashiwagi-san was at home.

152
00:08:09,018 --> 00:08:13,018
He brought a cell phone instead of a
mid-term tent.

153
00:08:13,018 --> 00:08:15,018
I think so.

154
00:08:15,018 --> 00:08:17,018
I think so.

155
00:08:19,018 --> 00:08:22,018
The person who uses the construction
site.

156
00:08:24,018 --> 00:08:26,018
That's Ryosuke.

157
00:08:28,018 --> 00:08:30,018
Kiro-chan, Kiro-chan.

158
00:08:30,018 --> 00:08:34,018
Kiro-chan, Kiro-chan.

159
00:08:38,018 --> 00:08:41,018
The person who is the most surprised.

160
00:08:43,018 --> 00:08:46,018
I'll ask you if I can scare you.

161
00:08:46,018 --> 00:08:48,018
I thought the same thing.

162
00:08:54,018 --> 00:08:56,018
I'm really sorry after I scare you.

163
00:08:56,018 --> 00:08:58,018
He's a really kind person.

164
00:08:58,018 --> 00:09:00,018
He's a good person.

165
00:09:00,018 --> 00:09:02,018
He's not a scary person.

166
00:09:04,018 --> 00:09:07,018
The person who is the most surprised.

167
00:09:10,018 --> 00:09:11,018
I don't know.

168
00:09:11,018 --> 00:09:13,018
The tail of a shrimp.

169
00:09:15,018 --> 00:09:17,018
What?

170
00:09:17,018 --> 00:09:19,018
What are you doing?

171
00:09:19,018 --> 00:09:23,538
The sense of

172
00:09:23,538 --> 00:09:28,538
I don't know.

173
00:09:28,538 --> 00:09:30,538
I don't know.

174
00:09:30,538 --> 00:09:33,538
I forgot the feeling.

175
00:09:33,538 --> 00:09:35,538
Don't forget.

176
00:09:35,538 --> 00:09:37,538
I forgot the feeling.

177
00:09:37,538 --> 00:09:39,538
I don't know what's in the ceiling.

178
00:09:41,538 --> 00:09:43,538
I'm wrong.

179
00:09:43,538 --> 00:09:45,538
I'll read it.

180
00:09:47,538 --> 00:09:49,538
Kashiwagi-san's shoes.

181
00:09:49,538 --> 00:09:51,538
It's a component.

182
00:09:51,538 --> 00:09:53,538
It's a component.

183
00:09:55,538 --> 00:09:57,538
The second-class of the factory.

184
00:09:59,538 --> 00:10:01,538
The person who is the most surprised.

185
00:10:03,538 --> 00:10:05,538
What are you not saying?

186
00:10:09,538 --> 00:10:11,538
What Nakayama-san doesn't say?

187
00:10:11,538 --> 00:10:13,538
Choriiiis.

188
00:10:15,538 --> 00:10:17,538
Choriiiis.

189
00:10:17,538 --> 00:10:21,538
This year's goal is to be sexy.

190
00:10:23,538 --> 00:10:25,538
Don't say it.

191
00:10:25,538 --> 00:10:27,538
Don't say it.

192
00:10:27,538 --> 00:10:35,110
I'm scared to slip for a week.

193
00:10:35,110 --> 00:10:37,110
That's the scariest thing.

194
00:10:37,110 --> 00:10:39,110
It's only two minutes, right?

195
00:10:39,110 --> 00:10:42,110
I'm scared of sliding for two minutes.

196
00:10:42,110 --> 00:10:44,110
And then on Sunday, I'm going to be...

197
00:10:44,110 --> 00:10:45,110
No, no, no!

198
00:10:45,110 --> 00:10:46,110
That's YouTube!

199
00:10:46,110 --> 00:10:47,110
I'm scared!

200
00:10:47,110 --> 00:10:49,110
Really.

201
00:10:49,110 --> 00:10:51,110
Like, PANTAWO!

202
00:10:51,110 --> 00:10:52,110
Yeah, like that.

203
00:10:52,110 --> 00:10:55,110
I don't know if it's America or
something,

204
00:10:55,110 --> 00:10:58,110
but I've heard it in foreign comedy
dramas.

205
00:10:58,110 --> 00:11:00,110
Like, oh!

206
00:11:00,110 --> 00:11:03,110
PANTAWO!

207
00:11:03,110 --> 00:11:05,110
I'm sure you've heard it a lot.

208
00:11:05,110 --> 00:11:06,110
I've heard it a lot.

209
00:11:06,110 --> 00:11:07,110
Let's hear it.

210
00:11:07,110 --> 00:11:09,110
I'm sure you've heard it a lot.

211
00:11:09,110 --> 00:11:11,110
Oh!

212
00:11:12,110 --> 00:11:14,110
Let's hear it.

213
00:11:14,110 --> 00:11:16,110
That's the funniest thing.

214
00:11:16,110 --> 00:11:18,110
That's the best answer I've heard so
far.

215
00:11:18,110 --> 00:11:22,110
What's the best answer you've heard so
far?

216
00:11:22,110 --> 00:11:23,110
I don't know.

217
00:11:26,110 --> 00:11:28,110
I want you to point it out.

218
00:11:28,110 --> 00:11:30,110
Let me point it out.

219
00:11:32,110 --> 00:11:35,110
I think there are people who can answer
other people's questions.

220
00:11:35,110 --> 00:11:37,110
I think it's okay.

221
00:11:37,110 --> 00:11:39,110
I think the members are the first time.

222
00:11:39,110 --> 00:11:41,110
Maybe the second time.

223
00:11:41,110 --> 00:11:43,110
I think so.

224
00:11:43,110 --> 00:11:45,110
Maybe the second time.

225
00:11:45,110 --> 00:11:47,110
I don't know if there are.

226
00:11:47,110 --> 00:11:50,110
Please look forward to the second
episode!
