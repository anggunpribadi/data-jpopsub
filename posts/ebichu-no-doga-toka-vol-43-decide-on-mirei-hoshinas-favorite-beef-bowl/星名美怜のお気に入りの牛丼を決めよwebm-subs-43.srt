1
00:00:00,890 --> 00:00:03,890
Ebichu no Douga Toka

2
00:00:07,890 --> 00:00:11,890
Let's decide on my favorite beef bowl!

3
00:00:14,890 --> 00:00:24,890
So, last time, when Mayuma-san and I ate
the first cup yakisoba, we talked.

4
00:00:24,890 --> 00:00:26,890
Oh, right. It was when we were talking.

5
00:00:26,890 --> 00:00:30,890
Today, we're going to talk about our
first encounter.

6
00:00:30,890 --> 00:00:32,890
Thank you for having me.

7
00:00:32,890 --> 00:00:35,890
So, today, we're going to talk about
beef bowl.

8
00:00:35,890 --> 00:00:37,890
Have you ever eaten beef bowl?

9
00:00:37,890 --> 00:00:39,890
Have we ever had it?

10
00:00:39,890 --> 00:00:41,890
I've never eaten it before.

11
00:00:41,890 --> 00:00:46,890
It's the only beef bowl that my mom
makes.

12
00:00:46,890 --> 00:00:49,890
It's like a mother's homemade beef bowl.

13
00:00:49,890 --> 00:00:51,890
But beef bowl is quite...

14
00:00:51,890 --> 00:00:53,890
The Naniha is very different.

15
00:00:53,890 --> 00:00:54,890
That's true.

16
00:00:54,890 --> 00:00:56,890
It's like a mother's homemade beef bowl.

17
00:00:56,890 --> 00:00:59,890
I'm not really familiar with beef bowl.

18
00:00:59,890 --> 00:01:02,890
Where am I?

19
00:01:02,890 --> 00:01:04,890
Is it Matsuya?

20
00:01:04,890 --> 00:01:10,890
Today, we're going to talk about
Yoshino, Sukiya, Matsuya, and Nakao.

21
00:01:10,890 --> 00:01:11,890
Nakao?

22
00:01:11,890 --> 00:01:14,890
I didn't know Nakao has beef bowl.

23
00:01:14,890 --> 00:01:15,890
I didn't know.

24
00:01:15,890 --> 00:01:16,890
It was like udon.

25
00:01:16,890 --> 00:01:18,890
I usually only eat udon.

26
00:01:18,890 --> 00:01:26,890
We're going to compare the beef bowl
from these four restaurants and find the
beef bowl that we like.

27
00:01:26,890 --> 00:01:28,890
We're going to find it and...

28
00:01:28,890 --> 00:01:29,890
And then...

29
00:01:29,890 --> 00:01:30,890
In the end...

30
00:01:30,890 --> 00:01:35,890
On the last day, we're going to go to
the restaurant and try it.

31
00:01:35,890 --> 00:01:38,890
We're going to try beef bowl by
ourselves.

32
00:01:38,890 --> 00:01:39,890
I see.

33
00:01:39,890 --> 00:01:41,890
So, this is tasting.

34
00:01:41,890 --> 00:01:43,890
Yes, it's tasting.

35
00:01:43,890 --> 00:01:51,890
In the last video, I said that I might
not have eaten beef bowl in Rikko's
room.

36
00:01:51,890 --> 00:01:53,890
That's how this project started.

37
00:01:53,890 --> 00:01:54,890
I see.

38
00:01:54,890 --> 00:01:55,890
What was it?

39
00:01:55,890 --> 00:02:09,610
It's a

40
00:02:09,610 --> 00:02:17,610
beef bowl restaurant.

41
00:02:17,610 --> 00:02:20,610
It's a beef bowl restaurant.

42
00:02:20,610 --> 00:02:25,610
So, let's eat beef bowl by Sukiya.

43
00:02:25,610 --> 00:02:27,610
Yay!

44
00:02:27,610 --> 00:02:29,610
Sukiya beef bowl.

45
00:02:29,610 --> 00:02:30,610
Sukiya is delicious.

46
00:02:30,610 --> 00:02:32,610
Shall we open it?

47
00:02:32,610 --> 00:02:33,610
Yes.

48
00:02:33,610 --> 00:02:34,610
It smells good.

49
00:02:34,610 --> 00:02:35,610
It smells good.

50
00:02:35,610 --> 00:02:36,610
It looks delicious.

51
00:02:36,610 --> 00:02:36,834
Thank you very much for your viewing!

52
00:02:36,834 --> 00:02:38,834
It's full of ingredients.

53
00:02:38,834 --> 00:02:40,834
I just like it.

54
00:02:40,834 --> 00:02:44,834
Let's eat.

55
00:02:44,834 --> 00:02:46,834
It's a real meal.

56
00:02:48,834 --> 00:02:50,834
I'll eat the meat first.

57
00:02:50,834 --> 00:02:52,834
You eat meat first?

58
00:02:52,834 --> 00:02:54,834
You eat meat first?

59
00:02:54,834 --> 00:02:56,834
It's beef bowl.

60
00:02:56,834 --> 00:02:58,834
It's delicious.

61
00:02:58,834 --> 00:03:00,834
I'll taste the original taste.

62
00:03:00,834 --> 00:03:02,834
How is it?

63
00:03:02,834 --> 00:03:04,834
It's delicious.

64
00:03:04,834 --> 00:03:06,834
It's delicious.

65
00:03:06,834 --> 00:03:08,834
I'll eat.

66
00:03:08,834 --> 00:03:10,834
It's refreshing.

67
00:03:10,834 --> 00:03:12,834
It's like this.

68
00:03:12,834 --> 00:03:14,834
Rice and meat.

69
00:03:14,834 --> 00:03:16,834
Beef bowl is...

70
00:03:16,834 --> 00:03:18,834
I don't usually eat it.

71
00:03:18,834 --> 00:03:22,834
When you eat meat and rice in a good
balance,

72
00:03:22,834 --> 00:03:24,834
It feels like a accomplishment.

73
00:03:24,834 --> 00:03:26,834
It's true.

74
00:03:26,834 --> 00:03:28,834
It's hard to balance.

75
00:03:28,834 --> 00:03:30,834
You have to remember the taste.

76
00:03:30,834 --> 00:03:32,834
I remember the taste.

77
00:03:32,834 --> 00:03:34,834
I'll eat it alone.

78
00:03:34,834 --> 00:03:36,834
It's refreshing.

79
00:03:36,834 --> 00:03:38,834
It tastes like pork.

80
00:03:38,834 --> 00:03:40,834
The onions are crispy.

81
00:03:42,834 --> 00:03:44,834
Beef bowl.

82
00:03:44,834 --> 00:03:46,834
It's like this.

83
00:03:46,834 --> 00:03:48,834
It's delicious.

84
00:03:48,834 --> 00:03:50,834
I want to eat this with onsen.

85
00:03:50,834 --> 00:03:52,834
I want to eat onsen with onsen.

86
00:03:52,834 --> 00:03:54,834
It looks delicious.

87
00:03:54,834 --> 00:03:56,834
It's refreshing.

88
00:03:56,834 --> 00:03:58,834
It looks delicious.

89
00:03:58,834 --> 00:04:00,834
Next.

90
00:04:00,834 --> 00:04:02,834
Thank you for the food.

91
00:04:02,834 --> 00:04:04,834
Thank you.

92
00:04:04,834 --> 00:04:06,834
Next.

93
00:04:06,834 --> 00:04:08,834
Next.

94
00:04:08,834 --> 00:04:10,834
What should I do?

95
00:04:10,834 --> 00:04:12,834
Yoshinoya Matsuya.

96
00:04:12,834 --> 00:04:14,834
I have a friend.

97
00:04:14,834 --> 00:04:16,834
I'll choose Yoshinoya.

98
00:04:16,834 --> 00:04:18,834
I'll open it.

99
00:04:18,834 --> 00:04:20,834
I'll open it.

100
00:04:20,834 --> 00:04:22,834
The onions are big.

101
00:04:22,834 --> 00:04:24,834
It's big.

102
00:04:24,834 --> 00:04:26,834
I see.

103
00:04:26,834 --> 00:04:28,834
I think the most delicious is the onsen.

104
00:04:28,834 --> 00:04:30,834
I think there is a lot of meat.

105
00:04:30,834 --> 00:04:32,834
I see.

106
00:04:32,834 --> 00:04:34,834
The taste of the meat is good.

107
00:04:34,834 --> 00:04:36,834
It's beef bowl.

108
00:04:36,834 --> 00:04:38,834
I'll eat it.

109
00:04:38,834 --> 00:04:40,834
I'll eat it.

110
00:04:40,834 --> 00:04:42,834
I'll eat it.

111
00:04:42,834 --> 00:04:44,834
I'll eat the meat first.

112
00:04:44,834 --> 00:04:46,834
I'll eat the meat first.

113
00:04:48,834 --> 00:04:50,834
How is it?

114
00:04:50,834 --> 00:04:52,834
It's different.

115
00:04:52,834 --> 00:04:54,834
It's different.

116
00:04:54,834 --> 00:04:56,834
It's sweet.

117
00:04:56,834 --> 00:04:58,834
It's sweet.

118
00:04:58,834 --> 00:05:00,834
I think the meat is sweeter.

119
00:05:00,834 --> 00:05:02,834
I'll eat it.

120
00:05:02,834 --> 00:05:04,834
I'll eat it.

121
00:05:04,834 --> 00:05:06,834
I'll eat it.

122
00:05:06,834 --> 00:05:08,834
I'll eat it.

123
00:05:08,834 --> 00:05:09,474
I'll eat it.

124
00:05:09,474 --> 00:05:11,474
I'll eat it with rice.

125
00:05:14,774 --> 00:05:16,774
Do you like it?

126
00:05:18,054 --> 00:05:20,054
I think Yoshinoya will like it.

127
00:05:21,014 --> 00:05:23,014
I think it's fast to eat.

128
00:05:23,014 --> 00:05:25,014
I'll eat it.

129
00:05:28,694 --> 00:05:30,694
It's delicious.

130
00:05:30,694 --> 00:05:32,694
The onion is delicious.

131
00:05:35,014 --> 00:05:36,014
This taste.

132
00:05:36,014 --> 00:05:38,014
Is it a sauce?

133
00:05:38,014 --> 00:05:40,014
I like the taste of that.

134
00:05:41,274 --> 00:05:43,274
The onion is delicious.

135
00:05:44,534 --> 00:05:46,534
The taste is different.

136
00:05:46,534 --> 00:05:48,534
I like Yoshinoya.

137
00:05:48,534 --> 00:05:50,534
I think Yoshinoya is better.

138
00:05:52,534 --> 00:05:54,534
I think the taste is strong.

139
00:05:54,534 --> 00:05:58,534
If you like it, you'll like the sauce.

140
00:06:00,534 --> 00:06:02,534
Was the onion delicious?

141
00:06:02,534 --> 00:06:04,534
The onion was a little soft.

142
00:06:04,534 --> 00:06:06,534
It's different.

143
00:06:06,534 --> 00:06:08,534
This is different.

144
00:06:08,534 --> 00:06:10,534
This is fun.

145
00:06:10,534 --> 00:06:12,534
Thank you for the food.

146
00:06:12,534 --> 00:06:14,534
Thank you.

147
00:06:14,534 --> 00:06:16,534
Next is Matsuya.

148
00:06:16,534 --> 00:06:18,534
I'll eat Matsuya.

149
00:06:18,534 --> 00:06:20,534
Matsuya

150
00:06:20,534 --> 00:06:22,534
I'll open it.

151
00:06:22,534 --> 00:06:24,534
By the way, I like Matsuya.

152
00:06:24,534 --> 00:06:26,534
I like Matsuya.

153
00:06:26,534 --> 00:06:30,534
I didn't expect rice and meat to be
separated.

154
00:06:30,534 --> 00:06:32,534
It's good.

155
00:06:32,534 --> 00:06:34,534
It's good.

156
00:06:34,534 --> 00:06:36,534
It's completely different.

157
00:06:36,534 --> 00:06:38,534
Thank you for waiting.

158
00:06:38,534 --> 00:06:40,534
I was waiting.

159
00:06:40,534 --> 00:06:42,534
I'm glad you came.

160
00:06:42,534 --> 00:06:44,534
Please eat.

161
00:06:44,534 --> 00:06:46,534
I will eat.

162
00:06:46,534 --> 00:06:48,534
I'll eat the meat first.

163
00:07:00,534 --> 00:07:02,534
I like it.

164
00:07:02,534 --> 00:07:04,534
I'm glad.

165
00:07:04,534 --> 00:07:10,534
The taste of the meat is stronger than
the taste of the sauce.

166
00:07:10,534 --> 00:07:14,534
I like the taste of the beef bowl.

167
00:07:14,534 --> 00:07:16,534
I like it.

168
00:07:20,534 --> 00:07:22,534
It's very delicious.

169
00:07:22,534 --> 00:07:24,534
I like it the most.

170
00:07:24,534 --> 00:07:26,534
I'm glad.

171
00:07:26,534 --> 00:07:28,534
I say that every day.

172
00:07:28,534 --> 00:07:30,534
I like it the most every time.

173
00:07:30,534 --> 00:07:32,534
Can you choose?

174
00:07:32,534 --> 00:07:34,534
Can you choose?

175
00:07:34,534 --> 00:07:36,534
I have decided.

176
00:07:36,534 --> 00:07:38,534
You can choose.

177
00:07:38,534 --> 00:07:41,442
I like this sauce the most.

178
00:07:41,442 --> 00:07:43,442
It's really the best.

179
00:07:43,442 --> 00:07:45,442
I've been eating the best.

180
00:07:47,442 --> 00:07:48,442
Delicious.

181
00:07:48,442 --> 00:07:49,442
This is my favorite.

182
00:07:49,442 --> 00:07:50,442
Is it your favorite?

183
00:07:50,442 --> 00:07:51,442
I'm glad.

184
00:07:52,442 --> 00:07:54,442
I'm eating three stores now, but it's
completely different.

185
00:07:54,442 --> 00:07:56,442
It's completely different.

186
00:07:56,442 --> 00:07:59,442
I've never really cared about it before.

187
00:07:59,442 --> 00:08:03,442
Certainly, you can tell by the level of
eating.

188
00:08:03,442 --> 00:08:05,442
For now,

189
00:08:06,442 --> 00:08:07,442
Matcha?

190
00:08:07,442 --> 00:08:09,442
I feel like it's matcha.

191
00:08:09,442 --> 00:08:10,442
It's the same.

192
00:08:10,442 --> 00:08:11,442
Lastly,

193
00:08:12,442 --> 00:08:13,442
Nakau?

194
00:08:13,442 --> 00:08:15,442
I've never eaten it before.

195
00:08:15,442 --> 00:08:16,442
Me too.

196
00:08:16,442 --> 00:08:17,442
Nakau.

197
00:08:17,442 --> 00:08:21,442
I'm going to eat Nakau beef bowl.

198
00:08:21,442 --> 00:08:23,442
What is Nakau beef bowl?

199
00:08:24,442 --> 00:08:25,442
I've never eaten Nakau beef bowl.

200
00:08:25,442 --> 00:08:26,442
I have the image of udon.

201
00:08:26,442 --> 00:08:29,442
I only eat udon.

202
00:08:29,442 --> 00:08:32,442
I thought there was beef bowl.

203
00:08:32,442 --> 00:08:35,442
I think this is a little different.

204
00:08:35,442 --> 00:08:38,442
It's a little thick.

205
00:08:38,442 --> 00:08:41,442
The aroma is the strongest.

206
00:08:41,442 --> 00:08:43,442
I'll eat it.

207
00:08:43,442 --> 00:08:46,442
It's amazing.

208
00:08:46,442 --> 00:08:48,442
The aroma is strong.

209
00:08:49,442 --> 00:08:51,442
I'll eat the beef first.

210
00:08:52,442 --> 00:08:54,442
How is it?

211
00:08:55,442 --> 00:08:57,442
It tastes strong.

212
00:08:57,442 --> 00:09:02,442
I want to eat this with rice.

213
00:09:02,442 --> 00:09:05,442
It's beef bowl, so please eat it.

214
00:09:05,442 --> 00:09:08,442
There are few people who eat only beef.

215
00:09:08,442 --> 00:09:14,442
Yoshinoe and Matsuya are sweet.

216
00:09:14,442 --> 00:09:16,442
This is

217
00:09:17,442 --> 00:09:22,442
It seems to go well with Benishogatari.

218
00:09:22,442 --> 00:09:25,442
I'll eat it too.

219
00:09:26,442 --> 00:09:28,442
It's the first time.

220
00:09:28,442 --> 00:09:32,442
It's Japanese soup stock.

221
00:09:35,442 --> 00:09:37,442
It's delicious.

222
00:09:38,442 --> 00:09:40,442
This is amazing.

223
00:09:40,442 --> 00:09:45,442
The taste of the soup stock is strong.

224
00:09:45,442 --> 00:09:46,442
It's amazing.

225
00:09:46,442 --> 00:09:48,442
It's delicious.

226
00:09:48,442 --> 00:09:50,442
I'll eat it.

227
00:09:50,442 --> 00:09:52,442
It tastes different.

228
00:09:52,442 --> 00:09:56,442
It depends on the restaurant.

229
00:09:56,442 --> 00:10:01,442
The way of making soup stock and soup
stock are different.

230
00:10:01,442 --> 00:10:08,442
The thickness of the ingredients, the
way of cutting, and the way of leaving
the texture are different.

231
00:10:08,442 --> 00:10:12,258
I don't have a lot of things to say.

232
00:10:12,258 --> 00:10:14,258
It's a taste of Arista.

233
00:10:14,258 --> 00:10:18,258
It's like a strong taste.

234
00:10:18,258 --> 00:10:20,258
It's like a soup stock.

235
00:10:20,258 --> 00:10:22,258
It's the darkest color.

236
00:10:22,258 --> 00:10:25,258
It's dark, but it's a little different
from what it looks like.

237
00:10:25,258 --> 00:10:27,258
It's good.

238
00:10:28,258 --> 00:10:33,258
So we compared the four-point beef bowl.

239
00:10:33,258 --> 00:10:36,258
They all tasted different.

240
00:10:36,258 --> 00:10:40,258
First of all, where is your favorite?

241
00:10:40,258 --> 00:10:43,258
I'm a Matsuya fan.

242
00:10:43,258 --> 00:10:47,258
When I compare the four types of food,

243
00:10:47,258 --> 00:10:50,258
I think they all have their own
characteristics and they are delicious.

244
00:10:50,258 --> 00:10:52,258
I'm lost.

245
00:10:53,258 --> 00:10:55,258
The stable one is Matsuya.

246
00:10:55,258 --> 00:10:59,258
I want to eat this in the future.

247
00:10:59,258 --> 00:11:01,258
Nakau.

248
00:11:01,258 --> 00:11:03,258
Nakau was delicious.

249
00:11:03,258 --> 00:11:07,258
I want to eat this with udon.

250
00:11:07,258 --> 00:11:09,258
Arisa.

251
00:11:09,258 --> 00:11:11,258
What about you, MINE?

252
00:11:11,258 --> 00:11:15,258
I'm lost between the two.

253
00:11:15,258 --> 00:11:19,258
I think it's different if you eat at a
store.

254
00:11:19,258 --> 00:11:25,258
I'm lost between the two stores of
Matsuya and Nakau.

255
00:11:25,258 --> 00:11:27,258
You're the same as me.

256
00:11:27,258 --> 00:11:31,258
We have similar taste.

257
00:11:32,258 --> 00:11:34,258
What is your favorite Matsuya?

258
00:11:34,258 --> 00:11:38,258
I think it's Matsuya.

259
00:11:38,258 --> 00:11:42,258
The meat was thin and had a strong
taste.

260
00:11:42,258 --> 00:11:53,258
The soup taste is similar to the sweet
taste of home.

261
00:11:53,258 --> 00:11:57,258
I like that it has a strong taste.

262
00:11:57,258 --> 00:12:03,258
I didn't have meat, so I could eat it
refreshingly.

263
00:12:03,258 --> 00:12:06,258
I think Matsuya is good.

264
00:12:06,258 --> 00:12:10,258
I want to eat this in the future.

265
00:12:10,258 --> 00:12:12,258
Please do.

266
00:12:12,258 --> 00:12:14,258
I'm looking forward to it.

267
00:12:14,258 --> 00:12:16,258
I like udon.

268
00:12:16,258 --> 00:12:18,258
I'm happy.

269
00:12:18,258 --> 00:12:20,258
Please enjoy it.

270
00:12:20,258 --> 00:12:23,258
I want to go to Matsuya alone.

271
00:12:24,258 --> 00:12:27,258
I want to go to Matsuya.

272
00:12:28,258 --> 00:12:35,258
I'm going to go to Matsuya, which I
liked the most among the four types of
udon.

273
00:12:35,258 --> 00:12:38,258
I want to eat udon alone.

274
00:12:38,258 --> 00:12:42,258
I want to eat udon and go shopping.

275
00:12:42,258 --> 00:12:45,762
I'm going to go shopping.

276
00:12:45,762 --> 00:12:58,586
Thank you for

277
00:12:58,586 --> 00:13:00,586
Let's eat!

278
00:13:01,586 --> 00:13:03,586
Topping is...

279
00:13:03,586 --> 00:13:05,586
Pororo and...

280
00:13:07,586 --> 00:13:10,586
I chose the fresh egg.

281
00:13:11,586 --> 00:13:13,586
I'll eat it simple.

282
00:13:15,586 --> 00:13:16,586
It's delicious.

283
00:13:16,586 --> 00:13:18,586
It's really good.

284
00:13:20,586 --> 00:13:21,586
It's delicious.

285
00:13:21,586 --> 00:13:26,586
It's better to eat it with toppings than
eating it as it is.

286
00:13:26,586 --> 00:13:28,586
It's really smooth.

287
00:13:32,586 --> 00:13:34,586
The wind is strong.

288
00:13:34,586 --> 00:13:37,586
I went to the restaurant by myself.

289
00:13:38,586 --> 00:13:44,586
This time, I topped the pororo and onsen
egg.

290
00:13:44,586 --> 00:13:49,586
I put the miso and ginger on top.

291
00:13:49,586 --> 00:13:52,586
I put the miso and ginger on the beef
bowl.

292
00:13:52,586 --> 00:13:54,586
It was really delicious.

293
00:13:54,586 --> 00:13:57,586
I ate it with fake arts.

294
00:13:57,586 --> 00:14:04,586
I thought it was the best to eat beef
bowl on top of other food.

295
00:14:04,586 --> 00:14:06,586
I was able to eat it.

296
00:14:06,586 --> 00:14:08,586
I can eat it quickly.

297
00:14:08,586 --> 00:14:13,586
I feel like I'm eating alone.

298
00:14:13,586 --> 00:14:16,586
I had a wonderful experience.

299
00:14:16,586 --> 00:14:17,586
It was delicious.

300
00:14:17,586 --> 00:14:21,781
Thank you for your viewing.
