1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,680
Watch the next one!

2
00:00:04,800 --> 00:00:05,800
Ouch! Ouch! Ouch!

3
00:00:05,800 --> 00:00:06,800
Stop it! Stop it!

4
00:00:06,800 --> 00:00:07,800
What's wrong?

5
00:00:07,800 --> 00:00:08,800
How old are you?

6
00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:10,800
How old are you?

7
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:11,800
I'm...

8
00:00:11,800 --> 00:00:15,800
I'm eating so much that I could be a
commentator.

9
00:00:15,800 --> 00:00:18,800
I ate curry the day before yesterday and
yesterday.

10
00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:19,800
What?

11
00:00:19,800 --> 00:00:22,800
I eat curry every day.

12
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:24,800
I have a dream.

13
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:27,800
I hope it comes true someday.

14
00:00:29,800 --> 00:00:30,800
Someday...

15
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:31,800
That's good.

16
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:33,800
I'm looking forward to it.

17
00:00:35,592 --> 00:00:37,592
Yakan Idol

18
00:00:38,592 --> 00:00:41,592
Happy New Year!

19
00:00:41,592 --> 00:00:43,592
Happy New Year!

20
00:00:43,592 --> 00:00:47,592
Thank you for your support.

21
00:00:47,592 --> 00:00:49,592
I'm Yakan.

22
00:00:49,592 --> 00:00:51,592
I look forward to working with you this
year.

23
00:00:51,592 --> 00:00:55,418
Please decorate the top banner for 2023.

24
00:00:55,418 --> 00:00:57,418
The winner is this idol!

25
00:00:57,418 --> 00:01:01,418
Once again, happy new year!

26
00:01:01,418 --> 00:01:03,418
Momoiro Clover Dance!

27
00:01:03,936 --> 00:01:06,936
I'm Takagi Reni, the lead dancer. Nice
to meet you.

28
00:01:07,936 --> 00:01:09,936
Nice to meet you, too.

29
00:01:09,936 --> 00:01:10,936
I'm Kotoyaro.

30
00:01:10,936 --> 00:01:12,936
Thank you.

31
00:01:12,936 --> 00:01:15,936
Finally, Takagi Reni is here.

32
00:01:16,936 --> 00:01:18,936
Thank you for the happy day.

33
00:01:18,936 --> 00:01:19,936
Congratulations.

34
00:01:19,936 --> 00:01:21,936
It's 2023.

35
00:01:21,936 --> 00:01:24,936
Finally, Takagi-san is turning 30.

36
00:01:24,936 --> 00:01:25,936
Oh, my God.

37
00:01:25,936 --> 00:01:27,936
It's the best end of the year.

38
00:01:27,936 --> 00:01:30,936
What year is it this year?

39
00:01:30,936 --> 00:01:32,936
It's the year of the rabbit.

40
00:01:32,936 --> 00:01:34,936
It's the year of the rabbit.

41
00:01:34,936 --> 00:01:37,936
It's the first New Year's Day.

42
00:01:37,936 --> 00:01:42,936
Last year was a big year for you, too.

43
00:01:42,936 --> 00:01:44,936
But it's the New Year's Day.

44
00:01:44,936 --> 00:01:48,936
What year do you want to spend this
year?

45
00:01:48,936 --> 00:01:50,936
This year?

46
00:01:50,936 --> 00:01:53,936
It's the 15th anniversary of Momokuro.

47
00:01:53,936 --> 00:01:55,936
Congratulations.

48
00:01:55,936 --> 00:01:57,472
Thank you.

49
00:01:58,472 --> 00:01:59,472
15th anniversary!

50
00:01:59,472 --> 00:02:02,472
It's our 15th anniversary. We were in
middle school.

51
00:02:02,472 --> 00:02:06,472
We've devoted half of our lives to
Momokuro.

52
00:02:06,472 --> 00:02:08,472
It's a year to remember.

53
00:02:08,472 --> 00:02:13,472
I hope we can do a lot of live
performances.

54
00:02:13,472 --> 00:02:16,472
I want to celebrate as much as possible.

55
00:02:16,472 --> 00:02:18,472
That's great.

56
00:02:18,472 --> 00:02:21,472
15 years is a great thing.

57
00:02:21,472 --> 00:02:22,472
Isn't it?

58
00:02:22,472 --> 00:02:24,472
By the way, the night view...

59
00:02:24,472 --> 00:02:25,472
Yes!

60
00:02:25,472 --> 00:02:27,472
It's great.

61
00:02:28,840 --> 00:02:30,840
How many nightstands?

62
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:34,840
There are 7 nightstands.

63
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:40,840
I'm sorry. I'm not sure about the age.

64
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:43,840
You've been doing this show for a long
time.

65
00:02:44,840 --> 00:02:47,840
It's been 3 months.

66
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:49,840
You haven't decided yet?

67
00:02:50,840 --> 00:02:52,840
I haven't decided yet, and I have to do
it.

68
00:02:52,840 --> 00:02:54,840
I'm aware of it now.

69
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:57,840
I'm thinking about the age and setting.

70
00:02:58,840 --> 00:03:00,840
We're going to have an event this year.

71
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:03,840
How many nightstands should I do for
that?

72
00:03:04,840 --> 00:03:05,840
But 7 nightstands are cute.

73
00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:08,840
It's obviously your voice.

74
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:10,840
This is different.

75
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:13,840
If you look at the O-MAYOR, you'll know.

76
00:03:14,840 --> 00:03:16,840
You talked about it before.

77
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:19,840
What you see is not everything.

78
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:21,840
That's right.

79
00:03:22,840 --> 00:03:24,840
I don't care about myself.

80
00:03:24,840 --> 00:03:26,840
It hurts! Stop it!

81
00:03:27,706 --> 00:03:29,706
Stop it!

82
00:03:29,706 --> 00:03:31,706
That's a bad place!

83
00:03:31,706 --> 00:03:33,706
Stop it!

84
00:03:33,706 --> 00:03:35,120
You can't do that!

85
00:03:36,120 --> 00:03:37,120
Stop it!

86
00:03:38,120 --> 00:03:40,120
You're supposed to be a man, right?

87
00:03:40,120 --> 00:03:42,120
You should be careful.

88
00:03:42,120 --> 00:03:44,120
That's right.

89
00:03:44,120 --> 00:03:50,120
We're going to start the main segment
from tomorrow.

90
00:03:50,120 --> 00:03:54,120
Starting tomorrow, we're going to have a
special version of the show.

91
00:03:54,120 --> 00:04:08,120
We're going to have a talk show with
Hoshina Mirei.

92
00:04:08,120 --> 00:04:10,960
Please look forward to it!

93
00:04:11,960 --> 00:04:13,960
Mirei, do you have any plans to talk to
me?

94
00:04:13,960 --> 00:04:14,960
No!

95
00:04:14,960 --> 00:04:20,960
I heard you say you like me when we were
in the same agency.

96
00:04:20,960 --> 00:04:23,960
But I didn't say it at all.

97
00:04:23,960 --> 00:04:27,960
I'm sure the agency told you that.

98
00:04:27,960 --> 00:04:29,960
You shouldn't say that.

99
00:04:29,960 --> 00:04:33,960
I want to hear the truth.

100
00:04:33,960 --> 00:04:39,960
I want to hear it, but I want to eat it
with you.

101
00:04:39,960 --> 00:04:40,736
Ouch!

102
00:04:40,736 --> 00:04:41,736
See you tomorrow!

103
00:04:41,736 --> 00:04:43,736
Look forward to it!
