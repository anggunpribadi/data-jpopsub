1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
What was the worst thing?

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,000
The worst thing was...

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:10,000
When I said I was sorry to him.

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:14,000
I'm really sorry about that time.

5
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:19,984
I'm sorry.

6
00:00:19,984 --> 00:00:24,984
I pretended not to see it, but I did.

7
00:00:24,984 --> 00:00:30,288
I pretended to understand and cried.

8
00:00:30,288 --> 00:00:33,708
The first time I met her was at the
audition.

9
00:00:33,848 --> 00:00:37,188
Kano Sei, please.

10
00:00:37,328 --> 00:00:47,068
Sei passed the back-to-back audition in
2022.

11
00:00:47,208 --> 00:00:51,708
Every day is a new experience.

12
00:00:51,828 --> 00:00:54,868
I'm motivated every day.

13
00:00:55,008 --> 00:00:56,308
That's good.

14
00:00:56,448 --> 00:00:59,408
Before the audition,

15
00:00:59,408 --> 00:01:02,508
did you work with other idols?

16
00:01:02,648 --> 00:01:07,308
Yes, I did.

17
00:01:07,448 --> 00:01:10,188
How long did you work with them?

18
00:01:10,328 --> 00:01:15,988
I think I worked with them for about a
year.

19
00:01:16,128 --> 00:01:20,288
I did other activities, too.

20
00:01:20,428 --> 00:01:28,308
How was the training camp for WAKKU in
2022?

21
00:01:28,308 --> 00:01:33,368
It was harder than I thought.

22
00:01:33,508 --> 00:01:36,008
Was there anything difficult?

23
00:01:36,148 --> 00:01:42,108
I had to work with the candidates

24
00:01:42,248 --> 00:01:47,848
from the beginning.

25
00:01:47,988 --> 00:01:49,588
I had to work on the performance.

26
00:01:49,728 --> 00:01:53,788
I had to work on things that didn't fit.

27
00:01:53,788 --> 00:01:58,688
I had to work on things that didn't fit.

28
00:01:58,828 --> 00:02:04,728
I had to work on things that didn't fit.

29
00:02:04,868 --> 00:02:10,168
What was the hardest time for you?

30
00:02:10,308 --> 00:02:12,628
The hardest time was...

31
00:02:12,768 --> 00:02:14,968
the fourth day?

32
00:02:15,108 --> 00:02:20,808
I didn't know what to do.

33
00:02:20,808 --> 00:02:26,948
I had to work with NEO and Tsuyogari.

34
00:02:27,088 --> 00:02:30,648
The ranking was falling.

35
00:02:30,788 --> 00:02:33,788
I thought I might not make it.

36
00:02:33,928 --> 00:02:37,188
I had to change, but I couldn't.

37
00:02:37,328 --> 00:02:42,228
I was worried about my performance.

38
00:02:42,368 --> 00:02:43,828
What was the hardest time for you?

39
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:45,920
I'm Tantan.

40
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:47,920
I'm Yua Okita.

41
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:49,920
I'm Leo Tres.

42
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:51,920
I'm Bernardo.

43
00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:56,314
Thank you for watching!

44
00:02:56,314 --> 00:03:15,994
Thank you for watching!

45
00:03:16,016 --> 00:03:21,016
When you were about to take the training
camp,

46
00:03:21,016 --> 00:03:26,016
you said you quit your previous agency.

47
00:03:26,016 --> 00:03:28,016
Is there something like that?

48
00:03:28,016 --> 00:03:34,016
I had the feeling that I would do
anything.

49
00:03:34,016 --> 00:03:39,016
So I think I took a step forward

50
00:03:39,016 --> 00:03:43,016
to something I had never done before.

51
00:03:43,016 --> 00:03:46,016
As soon as you joined,

52
00:03:46,016 --> 00:03:49,016
you released your new song, Signal.

53
00:03:49,016 --> 00:03:54,016
It was your first time writing lyrics
for all of your songs.

54
00:03:54,016 --> 00:03:56,016
Was it hard?

55
00:03:56,016 --> 00:03:59,016
It was hard.

56
00:03:59,016 --> 00:04:02,016
I had never written lyrics before,

57
00:04:02,016 --> 00:04:06,016
so I didn't know what to write.

58
00:04:06,016 --> 00:04:08,016
When I first released it,

59
00:04:08,016 --> 00:04:12,016
I thought it was different.

60
00:04:12,016 --> 00:04:14,016
I remember I was like,

61
00:04:14,016 --> 00:04:15,016
I'm sorry.

62
00:04:15,016 --> 00:04:18,016
You joined WAKKA and became very busy.

63
00:04:18,016 --> 00:04:24,016
I think your life has changed a lot.

64
00:04:24,016 --> 00:04:28,016
Is there anything you're not satisfied
with?

65
00:04:28,016 --> 00:04:30,016
Not satisfied?

66
00:04:30,016 --> 00:04:34,000
I'm not that satisfied.

67
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:37,780
Not really.

68
00:04:37,780 --> 00:04:41,180
I was really busy in August.

69
00:04:41,180 --> 00:04:43,380
Did you go out to play?

70
00:04:43,380 --> 00:04:45,020
Sometimes.

71
00:04:45,020 --> 00:04:49,680
I went out to play.

72
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:52,320
You went there.

73
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:58,720
Why did you go there?

74
00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:00,720
What?

75
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:02,720
I don't know.

76
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:04,720
What?

77
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:06,720
I don't know.

78
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:09,376
What is this?

79
00:05:09,376 --> 00:05:11,376
What is this?

80
00:05:12,376 --> 00:05:16,376
I'm busy and I think it's a waste to
sleep.

81
00:05:16,376 --> 00:05:18,376
You are a energetic type.

82
00:05:18,376 --> 00:05:23,376
I want to go to a little gap.

83
00:05:24,376 --> 00:05:26,376
I can't go to all the places.

84
00:05:26,376 --> 00:05:31,552
I can't go to all the places.

85
00:05:31,552 --> 00:05:33,552
I didn't know that.

86
00:05:33,552 --> 00:05:35,552
Did you go to the toilet?

87
00:05:35,552 --> 00:05:37,552
I went with my friend.

88
00:05:37,552 --> 00:05:39,552
How was it?

89
00:05:39,552 --> 00:05:41,552
I want to throw up a little more.

90
00:05:41,552 --> 00:05:45,552
No, I've thrown up enough.

91
00:05:45,552 --> 00:05:47,552
I don't use it, do I?

92
00:05:47,552 --> 00:06:02,552
That would be great.

93
00:06:03,322 --> 00:06:06,322
The interview was a lie.

94
00:06:06,592 --> 00:06:07,792
Is that so?

95
00:06:07,792 --> 00:06:08,792
It's a prank.

96
00:06:08,792 --> 00:06:09,792
Prank?

97
00:06:09,792 --> 00:06:10,292
Yes.

98
00:06:10,292 --> 00:06:11,292
I'm surprised. What do you mean?

99
00:06:11,292 --> 00:06:14,792
I'm wondering how many P's I can earn.

100
00:06:14,792 --> 00:06:17,792
I was surprised that you would ask such
a question.

101
00:06:17,792 --> 00:06:20,792
I was surprised.

102
00:06:20,792 --> 00:06:24,792
You said something that I would ask.

103
00:06:24,792 --> 00:06:28,792
I had to answer all the questions.

104
00:06:28,792 --> 00:06:32,792
The channel that shows that peak is
amazing.

105
00:06:32,792 --> 00:06:33,792
Certainly.

106
00:06:33,792 --> 00:06:36,792
I'm surprised by your smile.

107
00:06:46,874 --> 00:06:51,274
I pretended not to hear, even though I
did

108
00:06:52,074 --> 00:06:55,874
I pretended to be stupid and gave up

109
00:06:55,874 --> 00:07:00,221
I pretended not to see
