00:00.000 --> 00:01.018
 Yes genius

00:01.018 --> 00:03.018
 Hello everyone!

00:03.018 --> 00:05.018
 Hello!

00:05.018 --> 00:07.018
 To your heart, rock on!

00:07.018 --> 00:09.018
 We are Tokimeki Senri-Mu!

00:09.018 --> 00:11.018
 Thank you for having us!

00:15.872 --> 00:23.872
 We started with the excitement
barometer, but today we have a different
style.

00:23.872 --> 00:24.872
 That's right.

00:24.872 --> 00:26.872
 It's different from usual.

00:26.872 --> 00:28.872
 There are a lot of people in front of
us.

00:30.872 --> 00:33.872
 Today we're recording in public.

00:33.872 --> 00:39.872
 Thank you!

00:39.872 --> 00:41.872
 We're going to record it again.

00:42.426 --> 00:44.426
 It's fun!

00:44.426 --> 00:46.426
 I'm a bit nervous.

00:48.426 --> 00:50.426
 What we're going to do today is...

00:50.426 --> 00:54.426
 Do you remember the English prank we
did the other day?

00:54.426 --> 00:56.426
 I remember!

00:56.426 --> 00:58.426
 Of course I remember!

00:58.426 --> 01:00.426
 I don't want to recall the past though.

01:00.426 --> 01:02.426
 I don't want to remember it.

01:02.426 --> 01:04.426
 It's not a memory.

01:04.426 --> 01:14.426
 We're going to teach you English
lessons today!

01:18.360 --> 01:22.360
 If you invite us, we'd like to teach
you English lessons!

01:23.360 --> 01:24.360
 Let's call them out!

01:25.360 --> 01:27.360
 Ms. Riana!

01:27.360 --> 01:29.360
 Ms. Riana!

01:30.360 --> 01:31.360

 Yay!

02:39.770 --> 02:43.770

02:43.770 --> 02:45.770
 Thank you for your time!

02:45.770 --> 02:55.770
 What is the first lesson?

02:56.112 --> 03:00.112

03:10.112 --> 03:12.112
 Sensei, your pronunciation is good

03:12.112 --> 03:32.112
 Quiz! English words quiz

03:32.112 --> 03:36.112
 Why is there a punishment game?

03:36.112 --> 03:38.112
 It's a lesson, right?

03:38.112 --> 03:40.112
 Why is there a punishment game?

03:40.112 --> 03:45.112
 Sensei taught me that I shouldn't make
mistakes in class

03:45.112 --> 03:47.112
 I also learned that

03:49.064 --> 03:53.064
 Let's play the game!

03:54.064 --> 03:56.064
 Let's start! The first one is...

03:58.064 --> 03:59.064
 What was it?

04:02.064 --> 04:03.064
 What is it?

04:04.064 --> 04:05.064
 Oharu

04:05.064 --> 04:06.064
 Block?

04:07.064 --> 04:08.064
 Correct!

04:08.064 --> 04:10.064
 I did it!

04:11.034 --> 04:13.034
 I know this!

04:13.034 --> 04:14.034
 I know this!

04:14.034 --> 04:17.034
 When I was in junior high school, I
read a story about a frog.

04:17.034 --> 04:18.034
 Right?

04:18.034 --> 04:20.034
 That one!

04:20.034 --> 04:22.034
 The picture book.

04:22.034 --> 04:24.034
 The one with friends.

04:24.034 --> 04:25.034
 Right!

04:25.034 --> 04:29.034
 I feel like I played the English
version of that.

04:29.034 --> 04:31.034
 Yay!

04:31.034 --> 04:32.034
 I'm so jealous.

04:32.034 --> 04:34.034
 The second question.

04:34.034 --> 04:35.034
 Please.

04:36.034 --> 04:37.034
 Wait.

04:37.034 --> 04:39.034
 I feel like I know this.

04:39.034 --> 04:41.034
 I know this!

04:41.034 --> 04:42.034
 Alligator.

04:42.034 --> 04:43.034
 Yes.

04:43.034 --> 04:44.034
 What?

04:44.034 --> 04:45.034
 Wait.

04:45.034 --> 04:47.034
 Oh my god!

04:48.034 --> 04:55.034
 When I was in junior high school, my
English teacher did this.

04:55.034 --> 04:57.034
 With gestures?

04:57.034 --> 04:59.034
 Yes, with gestures.

04:59.034 --> 05:00.034
 I remember that.

05:00.034 --> 05:01.034
 I'm so glad.

05:02.034 --> 05:04.034
 I was confident when I was a kid.

05:04.034 --> 05:06.688
 I have a bad feeling about this.

05:07.688 --> 05:09.688
 The third one.

05:09.688 --> 05:11.688
 I don't know.

05:13.056 --> 05:14.056
 I don't know.

05:14.056 --> 05:15.056
 9th?

05:15.056 --> 05:17.056
 I don't know which one is which.

05:19.056 --> 05:20.056
 What?

05:20.056 --> 05:21.056
 What is this?

05:21.056 --> 05:23.056
 It's a Kabutoshi.

05:23.056 --> 05:24.056
 This one.

05:24.056 --> 05:26.056
 It starts with a B.

05:26.056 --> 05:28.056
 B. Letter B.

05:28.056 --> 05:29.056
 Big.

05:29.056 --> 05:30.056
 Big?

05:30.056 --> 05:31.056
 Everyone, listen.

05:31.056 --> 05:32.056
 Kanamin.

05:32.056 --> 05:33.056
 B-dog?

05:35.056 --> 05:36.056
 What?

05:37.056 --> 05:38.056
 B-dog? What is that?

05:38.056 --> 05:41.056
 There's a famous music band.

05:44.240 --> 05:45.240
 I don't know.

05:45.240 --> 05:47.240
 Peacock?

05:48.240 --> 05:50.240
 That's not it.

05:50.240 --> 05:52.240
 It's a bird.

05:53.240 --> 05:54.240
 It's not.

05:54.240 --> 05:55.240
 Super...

05:55.240 --> 05:57.240
 Wait, famous bird?

05:57.240 --> 05:59.240
 Yes, very famous.

05:59.240 --> 06:00.240
 I don't know.

06:01.240 --> 06:02.240
 Beatles?

06:03.240 --> 06:04.240
 Beatles?

06:04.240 --> 06:05.240
 Really?

06:05.240 --> 06:06.240
 Yes.

06:06.240 --> 06:07.240
 Yay!

06:08.240 --> 06:11.240
 I was too excited.

06:11.240 --> 06:13.240
 Really?

06:17.594 --> 06:19.594
 OK, next.

06:19.594 --> 06:28.026
 Fireworks.

06:28.026 --> 06:30.026
 I don't know.

06:30.026 --> 06:32.026
 I'm so nervous.

06:32.026 --> 06:34.026
 I think I know what it is.

06:38.026 --> 06:40.026
 I know what it is.

06:40.026 --> 06:41.026
 Julian.

06:41.026 --> 06:43.026
 Wait!

06:43.026 --> 06:45.026
 I was so close.

06:45.026 --> 06:47.026
 I was so close.

06:47.026 --> 06:49.026
 Wait a minute.

06:50.026 --> 06:54.026
 The answer is Julian.

06:54.026 --> 06:55.600
 The punishment game is...

06:56.600 --> 06:58.600
 I'm scared.

07:01.600 --> 07:02.600
 What?

07:02.600 --> 07:04.600
 Is this a squirrel?

07:04.600 --> 07:06.600
 What is a squirrel?

07:06.600 --> 07:08.600
 What is a squirrel in English?

07:10.600 --> 07:12.600
 Starts with S?

07:12.600 --> 07:13.600
 I don't know.

07:13.600 --> 07:15.600
 Everyone doesn't know.

07:15.600 --> 07:25.376
 A squirrel.

07:25.376 --> 07:27.376
 Scuba?

07:27.376 --> 07:29.376
 Scuba?

07:29.376 --> 07:31.376
 No.

07:31.376 --> 07:33.376
 Next.

07:33.376 --> 07:35.376
 Pass?

07:35.376 --> 07:38.376
 The answer is squirrel.

07:38.376 --> 07:40.376
 Squirrel?

07:40.376 --> 07:42.376
 I don't know.

07:42.376 --> 07:44.376
 It's not squirrel.

07:44.376 --> 07:46.376
 It's like squirrel.

07:46.376 --> 07:48.376
 Next.

07:48.376 --> 07:50.376
 Next?

07:50.376 --> 07:52.376
 Horse?

07:52.376 --> 07:54.376
 Calamine.

07:54.376 --> 07:55.232
 Next?

07:56.232 --> 07:57.232
 It's a donkey.

07:57.232 --> 07:58.232
 Donkey?

07:59.232 --> 08:01.232
 It starts with a D.

08:03.232 --> 08:05.232
 Okay, there's a famous game.

08:06.232 --> 08:07.232
 With the...

08:08.232 --> 08:10.232
 Something... Kong.

08:12.232 --> 08:13.232
 Maybe you know.

08:14.232 --> 08:15.232
 One more time.

08:15.232 --> 08:16.232
 DD Kong.

08:18.232 --> 08:19.232
 D Kong?

08:20.232 --> 08:21.232
 Kong.

08:21.232 --> 08:22.232
 No.

08:23.232 --> 08:24.232
 Donkey.

08:25.232 --> 08:26.232
 Donkey.

08:27.232 --> 08:28.232
 Thank you!

08:29.232 --> 08:30.232
 Thank you!

08:33.232 --> 08:36.232
 I don't know, so I'll just watch
everyone.

08:37.232 --> 08:39.232
 I'll rely on everyone.

08:39.232 --> 08:43.066
 Please subscribe to my channel!

08:43.066 --> 08:46.832
 The next question

08:46.832 --> 08:48.832
 Wow!

08:48.832 --> 08:50.832
 Wait, this is...

08:50.832 --> 08:52.832
 Wow!

08:52.832 --> 08:54.832
 Yay!

08:54.832 --> 08:56.832
 This is a simple book.

08:56.832 --> 08:58.832
 Wait.

08:58.832 --> 09:00.832
 Ghostbusters.

09:00.832 --> 09:02.832
 I love Ghostbusters.

09:04.832 --> 09:06.832
 Now, Ban-chan is RinChi.

09:06.832 --> 09:08.832
 This is crazy.

09:08.832 --> 09:10.832
 My heart is beating so fast.

09:10.832 --> 09:12.832
 Me too.

09:12.832 --> 09:14.144
 I love it.

09:15.144 --> 09:16.144
 What is this?

09:16.144 --> 09:17.144
 Is this me?

09:17.144 --> 09:19.144
 Isn't this Rokuon?

09:21.144 --> 09:22.144
 What?

09:23.144 --> 09:24.144
 Pistol?

09:25.144 --> 09:26.144
 Close?

09:26.144 --> 09:27.144
 Close?

09:27.144 --> 09:28.144
 It's a different word.

09:29.144 --> 09:30.144
 Not pistol.

09:31.144 --> 09:32.144
 I love it.

09:32.144 --> 09:33.144
 Pistol water?

09:33.144 --> 09:34.144
 It's a different word.

09:35.584 --> 09:38.584
 Water gun?

09:51.610 --> 09:53.610
 Water gun!

09:53.610 --> 09:55.610
 Water gun?

09:55.610 --> 09:57.610
 What is this?

09:57.610 --> 09:59.610
 I don't know!

09:59.610 --> 10:01.610
 But this is not a power of fate.

10:07.610 --> 10:09.610
 OK, next question.

10:09.610 --> 10:11.610
 Grandpa?

10:11.610 --> 10:13.610
 Yes, yes.

10:13.610 --> 10:15.610
 Grandfather.

10:17.610 --> 10:19.610
 See, I told you!

10:19.610 --> 10:21.610
 A big vase will be left behind.

10:23.480 --> 10:25.480
 What does Ojiichan mean?

10:25.480 --> 10:27.480
 Grandfather.

10:29.480 --> 10:33.480
 The next question is...

10:38.480 --> 10:39.480
 Newborn?

10:40.480 --> 10:41.480
 Alien?

10:42.480 --> 10:43.480
 What do you mean by alien?

10:45.480 --> 10:46.480
 Alien!

10:46.480 --> 10:48.480
 Alien!

10:53.402 --> 10:58.402
 The elementary school kid taught me
with her mouth.

10:59.402 --> 11:01.402
 I don't want to do this.

11:02.402 --> 11:04.402
 Hiori, it's a punishment game.

11:06.402 --> 11:09.402
 There is no punishment game.

11:11.402 --> 11:14.402
 Why are you making that face?

11:16.402 --> 11:18.402
 What's inside?

11:18.402 --> 11:22.402
 It's a black cannon.

11:23.402 --> 11:25.402
 Wait, now?

11:26.402 --> 11:28.402
 It's not slippery.

11:28.402 --> 11:31.392
 To be continued.

11:31.392 --> 11:34.392
 It's not slippery?

11:38.522 --> 11:42.522
 I was on the train with Kanamin.

11:42.522 --> 11:50.522
 A woman sitting next to me came up to
me.

11:50.522 --> 11:55.522
 She was very upset and seemed to be in
a bad mood.

11:55.522 --> 11:58.522
 I thought she might be okay.

11:58.522 --> 12:01.522
 I asked her if she was okay.

12:01.522 --> 12:06.522
 She had a plastic bag.

12:06.522 --> 12:11.522
 I called her when she got up.

12:11.522 --> 12:15.522
 After I got off the train, she was
fine.

12:15.522 --> 12:18.522
 She was laughing and talking.

12:18.522 --> 12:22.522
 I was glad she was fine.

12:22.522 --> 12:25.522
 It was funny.

12:25.522 --> 12:28.522
 The punishment game was hard.

12:28.522 --> 12:36.522
 Thank you.

12:40.986 --> 12:43.986
 Now, let's move on to the second
lesson!

12:47.520 --> 12:50.520
 What is the next lesson in 2 hours?

12:54.520 --> 12:56.520
 It's a word association lesson.

12:56.520 --> 12:58.520
 Oh, association lesson.

13:00.520 --> 13:05.520
 The teacher will give you a hint about
the word.

13:05.520 --> 13:09.520
 Please imagine the hint and give us the
answer.

13:09.520 --> 13:11.520
 Of course, we will answer in English.

13:11.520 --> 13:16.520
 For example, red, fruit, pen,
pineapple, then apple is correct.

13:16.520 --> 13:19.520
 This is BB&P.

13:19.520 --> 13:22.520
 Is it really a word?

13:24.520 --> 13:27.520
 Let's get started.

13:27.520 --> 13:29.520
 This is also an association lesson.

13:31.520 --> 13:32.520
 Let's go.

13:32.520 --> 13:34.520
 Let's do our best.

13:34.520 --> 13:38.112
 First question.

13:38.112 --> 13:40.112
 Red pants.

13:44.512 --> 13:46.512
 Cartoon character.

13:58.912 --> 14:00.912
 Cartoon character.

14:00.912 --> 14:02.912
 Next.

14:02.912 --> 14:04.912
 Cold.

14:09.912 --> 14:11.912
 Sweet.

14:12.912 --> 14:14.912
 Julia.

14:14.912 --> 14:16.912
 Ice.

14:19.528 --> 14:21.528
 Raise your hand.

14:22.528 --> 14:24.528
 Next.

14:25.528 --> 14:27.528
 Potatoes.

14:29.528 --> 14:31.528
 Carrots.

14:31.528 --> 14:33.528
 Brown.

14:37.680 --> 14:38.680
 Bambi.

14:38.680 --> 14:39.680
 Curry?

14:42.680 --> 14:44.680
 Even though you ate curry yesterday!

14:44.680 --> 14:45.680
 Eh? Potato?

14:45.680 --> 14:47.680
 I thought it was Bambi.

14:47.680 --> 14:49.680
 Potato is...

14:49.680 --> 14:50.680
 Potato is...

14:50.680 --> 14:52.680
 Potato is French fries.

14:52.680 --> 14:54.680
 French fries.

14:54.680 --> 14:56.680
 We did it the other day.

14:56.680 --> 14:57.680
 I see.

14:57.680 --> 15:00.680
 Even though you ate curry yesterday.

15:00.680 --> 15:02.680
 Next is...

15:02.680 --> 15:05.920
 Drink.

15:05.920 --> 15:07.920
 Any guesses?

15:07.920 --> 15:09.920
 Okay.

15:09.920 --> 15:11.920
 No, no, no.

15:13.920 --> 15:15.920
 They sell it in Harajuku.

15:15.920 --> 15:17.920
 Harajuku?

15:17.920 --> 15:19.920
 Ah!

15:19.920 --> 15:21.920
 Tokyo!

15:21.920 --> 15:23.920
 Ah!

15:27.920 --> 15:29.920
 Next.

15:29.920 --> 15:31.920
 Fearless.

15:32.352 --> 15:34.352
 Wireless?

15:36.352 --> 15:37.352
 I think.

15:37.352 --> 15:38.352
 Here.

15:39.352 --> 15:41.352
 It's something you hold with your hand.

15:43.352 --> 15:44.352
 Smartphone?

15:46.352 --> 15:47.352
 Oh no!

15:51.352 --> 15:52.352
 Voice.

15:53.352 --> 15:54.352
 Julian.

15:54.352 --> 15:55.352
 Mic.

15:58.624 --> 16:00.624
 Really?

16:00.624 --> 16:02.624
 Amazing.

16:02.624 --> 16:04.624
 So how was it? Was it difficult?

16:04.624 --> 16:06.624
 Difficult?

16:06.624 --> 16:09.624
 But there were some easy questions.

16:09.624 --> 16:12.624
 But if you could answer all of them, it
would be great.

16:12.624 --> 16:15.624
 But if you do this, you will get
smarter.

16:15.624 --> 16:17.624
 Yes, it's a game of transmission.

16:17.624 --> 16:19.624
 Like this.

16:19.624 --> 16:21.624
 Stand up!

16:21.624 --> 16:23.624
 Stand up, please.

16:23.624 --> 16:25.624
 Bow.

16:25.624 --> 16:27.624
 Thank you very much.

16:27.624 --> 16:29.624
 Thank you very much.

16:32.090 --> 16:39.090
 Thank you for watching.

16:39.578 --> 16:41.578
 Why?

16:49.578 --> 16:51.578
 It was so much fun.

16:51.578 --> 17:01.578
 I was so nervous.

17:02.710 --> 17:05.650
 I feel much better now!

17:05.750 --> 17:10.010
 I remember that last year, I was
offered a vocal recital,

17:10.350 --> 17:14.790
 so I want to work harder for the
future.

17:14.890 --> 17:17.390
 It was so much fun!

17:17.490 --> 17:19.890
 Thank you, everyone.

17:19.890 --> 17:21.890
 Thank you for watching.

17:23.456 --> 17:26.036
 Happy birthday to you!

17:26.036 --> 17:28.676
 Happy birthday to you!

17:28.676 --> 17:32.396
 Happy birthday dear Kanami!

17:32.396 --> 17:35.756
 Happy birthday to you!

17:35.756 --> 17:37.756
 Happy birthday!

17:37.756 --> 17:39.756
 Happy birthday!

17:39.756 --> 17:41.756
 Yay! Thank you!

17:41.756 --> 17:43.756
 So cute!

17:43.756 --> 17:45.756
 I was watching!

17:45.756 --> 17:47.756
 Yay!

17:47.756 --> 17:48.756
 So cute!

17:48.756 --> 17:50.756
 It says Kanami on it.

17:50.756 --> 17:52.756
 Read it.

17:52.756 --> 17:54.756
 No, it's not!

17:54.756 --> 17:56.756
 It's coming!

17:56.756 --> 17:58.756
 No, it's not!

17:58.756 --> 18:00.756
 It's Kanami!

18:00.756 --> 18:02.756
 It's coming!

18:02.756 --> 18:04.756
 It's coming!

18:04.756 --> 18:06.756
 Coming?

18:06.756 --> 18:08.756
 Yay!

18:08.756 --> 18:10.756
 Thank you!

18:10.756 --> 18:12.756
 It's a video.

18:12.756 --> 18:14.756
 It's a video.

18:14.756 --> 18:16.756
 How was it, everyone?

18:16.756 --> 18:18.756
 It was great.

18:18.756 --> 18:20.756
 I see.

18:20.756 --> 18:22.756
 Next time, we'll do it in English.

18:22.756 --> 18:24.756
 Next time, we'll do it in English.

18:24.756 --> 18:26.756
 Juri is great.

18:26.756 --> 18:28.756
 She's really...

18:28.756 --> 18:30.756
 No, no.

18:32.756 --> 18:34.756
 How many times

18:34.756 --> 18:36.756
 have you been

18:36.756 --> 18:38.756
 good at English?

18:38.756 --> 18:40.756
 English...

18:40.756 --> 18:41.184
 No?

18:42.184 --> 18:43.184
 What are you best at?

18:43.184 --> 18:49.184
 I'm doing well in the exam, but I'm
still struggling with my Japanese.

18:51.184 --> 18:56.184
 I haven't done English yet, but it's
fun.

18:56.184 --> 18:59.184
 But it's a little difficult.

19:01.184 --> 19:03.184
 It's difficult today.

19:03.184 --> 19:05.184
 I won't do it.

19:06.184 --> 19:09.184
 You have to learn English.

19:09.184 --> 19:12.184
 But when I went abroad, I was
struggling.

19:12.184 --> 19:14.184
 That's right.

19:14.184 --> 19:16.184
 I'm doing my best.

19:17.480 --> 19:18.480
 Let's do our best.

19:19.480 --> 19:21.480
 Let's dance with us.

19:21.480 --> 19:23.480
 Let's do our best.

19:23.480 --> 19:25.480
 Let's do our best.

19:41.754 --> 19:44.474
 I felt good

19:44.474 --> 19:49.274
 Because I fell in love with you

19:49.274 --> 19:50.914
 Next Episode

19:50.914 --> 19:51.914
 I'm looking forward to it!

19:51.914 --> 19:53.634
 Let's go forward, high-five!

19:53.634 --> 19:56.434
 If you're depressed, come with me

19:56.434 --> 19:59.234
 One, two, three

19:59.234 --> 20:02.074
 You can overcome anything

20:02.074 --> 20:07.754
 Go to the future

20:07.754 --> 20:12.754
 By all means

20:12.794 --> 20:15.954
 From nowoln, Pt Story

20:24.134 --> 20:24.774
 More?

20:28.754 --> 20:29.434
 Wespoon

20:31.354 --> 20:38.814
 Din

20:38.814 --> 20:58.741
 Thank you for watching!
