00:00:08,500 --> 00:00:12,840
And the other members are thinking

And next, she heard a

6
00:00:19,120 --> 00:00:21,320
Scary

7
00:00:21,320 --> 00:00:24,260
A horror movie

8
00:00:24,740 --> 00:00:26,480
Members were very much interested

9
00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:30,480

Ebisu Tastas!

16

What is the thing that you can't show
your true self?

17
00:01:26,826 --> 00:01:29,826
This program is provided by the sponsor

18
00:01:29,826 --> 00:01:33,826
There are some parts that I overacted

19
00:01:34,826 --> 00:01:36,826
Are you overacting?

20
00:01:39,826 --> 00:01:41,826
Ebisu Tastas has started!

21
00:01:41,826 --> 00:01:43,826

00:01:44,826 --> 00:01:47,826
I will show you my true self

23
00:01:47,826 --> 00:01:49,826
Thank you!

24
00:01:49,826 --> 00:01:53,882
Hello!

25
00:01:53,882 --> 00:01:55,882
The costumes are new

26
00:01:55,882 --> 00:01:57,882
It's a new song

27
00:01:57,882 --> 00:01:59,882
It's amazing

28
00:01:59,882 --> 00:02:01,882
What costume is this?

29
00:02:01,882 --> 00:02:03,882
Superhero

30
00:02:03,882 --> 00:02:05,882
That's why everyone is wearing a cape

31
00:02:05,882 --> 00:02:11,882
Matsuno said that Ebichu Tatsuta has
started

32
00:02:11,882 --> 00:02:13,882
It has started

33
00:02:13,882 --> 00:02:15,882
What do you mean?

34
00:02:15,882 --> 00:02:17,882
It has started

35
00:02:19,882 --> 00:02:21,882
It should have started

36
00:02:21,882 --> 00:02:23,882
It has already started

37
00:02:23,882 --> 00:02:27,882
What is the member who is confused by
Takiue's statement?

38
00:02:27,882 --> 00:02:31,882
Actually, 15 minutes ago

39
00:02:31,882 --> 00:02:33,882
It's bad

40
00:02:33,882 --> 00:02:35,882
It's bad

41
00:02:35,882 --> 00:02:39,882
This is the meeting with the staff
before the recording

42
00:02:39,882 --> 00:02:41,882
It's 3 o'clock

43
00:02:41,882 --> 00:02:45,882
Please

44
00:02:45,882 --> 00:02:47,882
Please

45
00:02:47,882 --> 00:02:48,314
Please subscribe to the channel

46
00:02:48,314 --> 00:02:53,314
Why are they shooting this scene?

47
00:02:55,314 --> 00:02:57,314
The road trip has started

48
00:02:57,314 --> 00:03:00,314
Takiue and Chue of Nagareboshi

49
00:03:00,314 --> 00:03:02,314
It's hot

50
00:03:02,314 --> 00:03:06,314
And the 6th episode of Kaikyo show,
Ogata Kaiki

51
00:03:06,314 --> 00:03:09,314
What does this opening mean?

52
00:03:09,314 --> 00:03:12,314
It's different from the usual opening

53
00:03:12,314 --> 00:03:17,314
This time the theme is truth

54
00:03:17,314 --> 00:03:24,314
They are trying to show their true
feelings

55
00:03:24,314 --> 00:03:29,314
So they are using a hidden camera

56
00:03:29,314 --> 00:03:32,314
They are using a hidden camera?

57
00:03:32,314 --> 00:03:34,314
Yes

58
00:03:36,314 --> 00:03:38,314
Kashiwagi-san is writing something

59
00:03:38,314 --> 00:03:40,314
Is he writing a book?

60
00:03:40,314 --> 00:03:42,314
Yes

61
00:03:42,314 --> 00:03:46,314
The theme is truth

62
00:03:46,314 --> 00:03:51,314
They are using a hidden camera to find
out their true feelings

63
00:03:51,314 --> 00:03:54,314
The expert will analyze it

64
00:03:54,314 --> 00:03:59,314
They will find out what the members are
thinking

65
00:04:00,314 --> 00:04:02,314
Did they start from the meeting?

66
00:04:02,314 --> 00:04:04,314
I don't know

67
00:04:04,314 --> 00:04:07,314
We were shooting the meeting secretly

68
00:04:07,314 --> 00:04:09,314
No

69
00:04:09,314 --> 00:04:13,314
The theme is truth

70
00:04:13,314 --> 00:04:15,314
Hurry up

71
00:04:15,314 --> 00:04:20,314
They are looking into the members' mind

72
00:04:20,314 --> 00:04:23,314
They are shooting the meeting secretly

73
00:04:23,314 --> 00:04:27,314
What will they find out?

74
00:04:27,314 --> 00:04:32,314
The expert will analyze the truth of
Ebichu

75
00:04:32,314 --> 00:04:36,314
The analyst is Amon Nijihiko

76
00:04:36,314 --> 00:04:40,314
He is a professional of psychological
analysis

77
00:04:40,314 --> 00:04:43,314
Let's start the analysis

78
00:04:43,314 --> 00:04:50,314
First, we will analyze the truth in the
position where they were sitting

79
00:04:52,314 --> 00:04:57,314
First, they will analyze the truth in
the position where they were sitting

80
00:04:57,314 --> 00:05:04,314
Ebichu members are sitting in front of
the producer

81
00:05:05,314 --> 00:05:10,314
What will be the truth?

82
00:05:11,314 --> 00:05:14,314
What will they find out?

83
00:05:14,314 --> 00:05:16,314
I'm scared

84
00:05:16,314 --> 00:05:19,314
The power relationship in the group

85
00:05:19,314 --> 00:05:22,314
I didn't know

86
00:05:22,314 --> 00:05:22,394
coastal

87
00:05:22,394 --> 00:05:23,394
What?

88
00:05:23,394 --> 00:05:27,394
Basically, Ebichu is like everyone is
together.

89
00:05:27,394 --> 00:05:28,394
That's right.

90
00:05:28,394 --> 00:05:29,394
But there is no leader.

91
00:05:29,394 --> 00:05:30,394
No.

92
00:05:30,394 --> 00:05:37,394
By the way, is there anyone who thinks
that I'm the leader?

93
00:05:37,394 --> 00:05:38,394
Don't say that.

94
00:05:38,394 --> 00:05:39,394
Don't say that.

95
00:05:41,394 --> 00:05:43,394
What is the name of the person who is
the leader?

96
00:05:43,394 --> 00:05:45,394
Mayamaka Hoshina.

97
00:05:45,394 --> 00:05:49,394
I thought it was Yasumoto who was not
stabbed at all.

98
00:05:49,394 --> 00:05:50,394
I see.

99
00:05:50,394 --> 00:05:53,394
Yasumoto thinks that way.

100
00:05:53,394 --> 00:05:56,394
I want to be like that.

101
00:05:56,394 --> 00:05:58,394
I'm embarrassed.

102
00:05:58,394 --> 00:06:00,394
I'm sure you will take responsibility
gradually.

103
00:06:00,394 --> 00:06:01,394
That's good.

104
00:06:02,394 --> 00:06:06,394
Yasumoto is the leader who is just self-
proclaimed.

105
00:06:06,394 --> 00:06:11,394
Then, who do you think is the leader?

106
00:06:11,394 --> 00:06:18,394
According to the sitting order now, I'm
the leader unconsciously.

107
00:06:18,394 --> 00:06:19,394
That's right.

108
00:06:19,394 --> 00:06:22,394
By the way, I'm the leader.

109
00:06:22,394 --> 00:06:28,394
I think that I have the most power in
the group.

110
00:06:28,394 --> 00:06:30,394
Actually, I sat in this seat.

111
00:06:34,394 --> 00:06:35,394
I didn't expect it.

112
00:06:35,394 --> 00:06:36,394
Matsuoka.

113
00:06:36,394 --> 00:06:38,394
I'm sorry.

114
00:06:38,394 --> 00:06:39,394
I'm the leader.

115
00:06:39,394 --> 00:06:40,394
Leader.

116
00:06:40,394 --> 00:06:42,394
Matsuoka, the leader.

117
00:06:42,394 --> 00:06:44,394
Matsuoka, the leader.

118
00:06:44,394 --> 00:06:45,394
How is it?

119
00:06:45,394 --> 00:06:47,394
I've never thought of it.

120
00:06:47,394 --> 00:06:48,394
Really?

121
00:06:48,394 --> 00:06:50,394
But it's true.

122
00:06:50,394 --> 00:06:52,094
Matsuoka is a type that goes to the

123
00:06:52,094 --> 00:06:55,394
end of the road.

124
00:06:55,394 --> 00:06:58,394
He can go to the opposite side with
anyone.

125
00:06:58,394 --> 00:07:00,394
I think he has a talent.

126
00:07:00,394 --> 00:07:06,394
Matsuoka was the leader unconsciously.

127
00:07:06,394 --> 00:07:08,394
Here is the scene.

128
00:07:08,394 --> 00:07:14,394
The position of the leader is the
position where the producer and the
person face each other.

129
00:07:14,394 --> 00:07:19,394
There is a sense of self-awareness of
the leader.

130
00:07:19,394 --> 00:07:27,394
And the position of the producer, who is
the best, is on the right side.

131
00:07:27,394 --> 00:07:31,394
That's the same as the producer.

132
00:07:31,394 --> 00:07:33,394
Or something like that.

133
00:07:33,394 --> 00:07:34,394
Something more than that?

134
00:07:34,394 --> 00:07:35,394
That's somewhere.

135
00:07:35,394 --> 00:07:37,394
That's something more than that.

136
00:07:37,394 --> 00:07:43,394
The act of sitting in front of the other
person is the expression of the
psychology of the representative.

137
00:07:43,394 --> 00:07:52,394
And seeing the other person on the other
side of your wrist is psychologically
the strong consciousness of the other
person and the other person.

138
00:07:52,966 --> 00:07:57,286
He Pak artic jou so concepts filled

139
00:07:59,826 --> 00:08:16,926
Still his body's

140
00:08:16,926 --> 00:08:20,926
This is a scene where he is threatening
the person in front of him.

141
00:08:26,926 --> 00:08:31,926
This is the scene where he is
threatening the producer.

142
00:08:33,926 --> 00:08:37,926
Is there something like this?

143
00:08:37,926 --> 00:08:40,926
There is a sense of threat.

144
00:08:41,926 --> 00:08:43,926
He is threatening the producer.

145
00:08:43,926 --> 00:08:46,926
He is very sharp.

146
00:08:46,926 --> 00:08:49,926
He is pulling his hands on his chin.

147
00:08:49,926 --> 00:08:54,926
I am the one who is evaluating the
situation.

148
00:08:54,926 --> 00:08:57,926
He is saying something bad.

149
00:08:57,926 --> 00:09:00,926
I am evaluating the producer.

150
00:09:00,926 --> 00:09:03,926
This is a live performance.

151
00:09:03,926 --> 00:09:07,926
There is a sense of threat deep inside
his heart.

152
00:09:07,926 --> 00:09:10,926
We can expect today's performance.

153
00:09:10,926 --> 00:09:13,926
There is a person next to him.

154
00:09:13,926 --> 00:09:15,926
He is the leader.

155
00:09:15,926 --> 00:09:18,926
Let's call him the leader.

156
00:09:18,926 --> 00:09:21,926
Let's call him the leader.

157
00:09:21,926 --> 00:09:23,926
How is it, Mato?

158
00:09:23,926 --> 00:09:26,926
I don't like it.

159
00:09:26,926 --> 00:09:29,926
You don't get along with each other at
first.

160
00:09:29,926 --> 00:09:32,926
It's not like that.

161
00:09:32,926 --> 00:09:36,926
By the way, the leader behind you is
also a leader.

162
00:09:36,926 --> 00:09:40,926
I'm scared of the leader behind me.

163
00:09:40,926 --> 00:09:44,926
The leader behind you who controls the
shrimp in the shadow.

164
00:09:44,926 --> 00:09:48,926
He will know that in a sitting position.

165
00:09:48,926 --> 00:09:51,926
What is the person?

166
00:09:51,926 --> 00:09:54,926
The person behind you is...

167
00:09:54,926 --> 00:09:57,926
This is...

168
00:09:57,926 --> 00:09:59,926
This is A.

169
00:09:59,926 --> 00:10:01,926
Why is it A?

170
00:10:01,926 --> 00:10:03,926
There is no A.

171
00:10:03,926 --> 00:10:05,926
I thought so.

172
00:10:05,926 --> 00:10:07,926
Everyone agrees with this.

173
00:10:07,926 --> 00:10:10,926
I don't know, but I agree with it.

174
00:10:10,926 --> 00:10:13,926
This position is...

175
00:10:13,926 --> 00:10:18,926
The leader and the producer look at each
other objectively.

176
00:10:18,926 --> 00:10:22,926
Moreover, the leader is immediately
seated in this seat.

177
00:10:22,926 --> 00:10:23,926
I see.

178
00:10:23,926 --> 00:10:27,926
The leader behind you is the leader of
the members.

179
00:10:27,926 --> 00:10:31,926
While looking at the producer on the
right, the leader is also in the field.

180
00:10:31,926 --> 00:10:34,926
What is the truth?

181
00:10:34,926 --> 00:10:36,546
The leader is...

182
00:10:36,546 --> 00:10:39,546
He's waiting for the right time to make
a mistake.

183
00:10:39,546 --> 00:10:41,546
Wait for the right time?

184
00:10:41,546 --> 00:10:43,546
Next is Sawa.

185
00:10:43,546 --> 00:10:45,546
I'm scared.

186
00:10:45,546 --> 00:10:47,546
The boss is here.

187
00:10:47,546 --> 00:10:49,546
He's here.

188
00:10:49,546 --> 00:10:51,546
He's waiting for the right time.

189
00:10:51,546 --> 00:10:55,546
When you were chosen as the lead, you
said you were scared.

190
00:10:55,546 --> 00:10:57,546
Do you have any feelings?

191
00:10:57,546 --> 00:11:03,026
I have an image of a

192
00:11:03,026 --> 00:11:03,546
Do you know what a

193
00:11:03,546 --> 00:11:07,546
So you're hiding inside without going
out, right?

194
00:11:07,546 --> 00:11:09,546
I'll do it.

195
00:11:09,546 --> 00:11:11,546
Isn't it a little different?

196
00:11:11,546 --> 00:11:13,546
It's close.

197
00:11:13,546 --> 00:11:15,546
It's kind of right.

198
00:11:15,546 --> 00:11:17,546
I feel like I'm answering.

199
00:11:19,546 --> 00:11:23,546
When the members' power relations are
known,

200
00:11:23,546 --> 00:11:25,546
psychological tests are carried out.

201
00:11:25,546 --> 00:11:27,546
In addition,

202
00:11:27,546 --> 00:11:31,546
I will investigate the true psychology
of the shrimp.

203
00:11:31,546 --> 00:11:35,546
First question.

204
00:11:35,546 --> 00:11:39,546
First of all, please write about
yourself and Fuji.

205
00:11:39,546 --> 00:11:41,546
That's it.

206
00:11:41,546 --> 00:11:43,546
It's okay to write freely.

207
00:11:43,546 --> 00:11:45,546
You thought about it, didn't you?

208
00:11:45,546 --> 00:11:51,546
Let's write about yourself and Fuji
freely.

209
00:11:51,546 --> 00:11:53,546
With this psychological test,

210
00:11:53,546 --> 00:11:57,546
The members' embarrassing faces are
clearly visible.

211
00:11:57,546 --> 00:12:01,546
What do you know about this test?

212
00:12:01,546 --> 00:12:03,546
In this test,

213
00:12:03,546 --> 00:12:07,546
You'll know your narcissism.

214
00:12:07,546 --> 00:12:09,546
How conscious are you?

215
00:12:09,546 --> 00:12:11,546
You'll know.

216
00:12:11,546 --> 00:12:17,546
This psychological test will reveal your
narcissism.

217
00:12:17,546 --> 00:12:21,546
How to describe yourself to the best
Fuji in Japan.

218
00:12:21,546 --> 00:12:23,546
We'll see through the narcissism.

219
00:12:23,546 --> 00:12:27,546
First, the 8th place.

220
00:12:27,546 --> 00:12:29,546
It's the last.

221
00:12:29,546 --> 00:12:31,546
It's not the best narcissism.

222
00:12:31,546 --> 00:12:33,546
Please announce the 8th place.

223
00:12:33,546 --> 00:12:35,546
The 8th place is...

224
00:12:35,546 --> 00:12:37,546
Nakayama.

225
00:12:37,546 --> 00:12:41,546
This is the picture Nakayama drew.

226
00:12:41,546 --> 00:12:45,546
It's very simple.

227
00:12:45,546 --> 00:12:47,546
In the case of Nakayama,

228
00:12:47,546 --> 00:12:51,546
One of the points is that he drew
himself at the bottom.

229
00:12:51,546 --> 00:12:55,546
And he said he drew himself very simply.

230
00:12:55,546 --> 00:12:57,546
I don't think it's simpler than this.

231
00:12:57,546 --> 00:13:01,546
I can't draw well, so I can only draw
this.

232
00:13:01,546 --> 00:13:05,546
In a good way, he's a very humble
person.

233
00:13:05,546 --> 00:13:08,898
He's not very self-centered.

234
00:13:08,898 --> 00:13:14,138
I think it's okay to have a little more
confidence in a humble person who
doesn't go

235
00:13:15,658 --> 00:13:20,098
It's just the truth, but the best of the
best in Japan, Fuji-san and himself

236
00:13:20,098 --> 00:13:22,378
The best of the best in the world, the
narcissist is revealed

237
00:13:23,378 --> 00:13:25,378
Next, the seventh place

238
00:13:26,578 --> 00:13:28,578
The seventh place is Kobayashi-san

239
00:13:28,578 --> 00:13:29,538
I did it!

240
00:13:29,538 --> 00:13:30,538
Kobayashi-san!

241
00:13:30,538 --> 00:13:32,538
Well, Kobayashi-san

242
00:13:32,778 --> 00:13:35,018
Kobayashi-san is also a humble person

243
00:13:35,018 --> 00:13:38,978
Kobayashi-san wrote himself small at the
foot of Mt. Fuji

244
00:13:38,978 --> 00:13:42,978
Because of his humble nature, he is a
narcissist

245
00:13:42,978 --> 00:13:39,118
And also, Sensei, what is this

246
00:13:39,118 --> 00:13:43,118
And also, Sensei, what is this

247
00:13:43,118 --> 00:13:47,118
And also, Sensei, what is this

248
00:13:47,118 --> 00:13:50,118
It's a forest, I drew a tree

249
00:13:50,118 --> 00:13:55,118
He doesn't know how to climb the top

250
00:13:55,118 --> 00:13:57,118
He's a little lost

251
00:13:57,118 --> 00:13:59,118
Oh

252
00:13:59,118 --> 00:14:02,118
If you climb that mountain, you'll get
tangled in the hair

253
00:14:02,118 --> 00:14:04,118
It's a miracle

254
00:14:04,118 --> 00:14:08,118
And the sixth to fourth place of the
narcissist is as you can see

255
00:14:08,118 --> 00:14:12,118
After all, he wrote himself small at the
foot of Mt. Fuji

256
00:14:12,118 --> 00:14:16,118
Because of his humble nature, he is a
narcissist

257
00:14:16,118 --> 00:14:18,118
There are three remaining members

258
00:14:18,118 --> 00:14:23,118
Who is the person he loves the most
among them?

259
00:14:23,118 --> 00:14:25,118
This is great, the narcissist's best
three

260
00:14:25,118 --> 00:14:27,118
The leader and the back leader are
remaining

261
00:14:27,118 --> 00:14:29,118
Yes

262
00:14:29,118 --> 00:14:34,118
The leader and the back leader are
remaining

263
00:14:34,118 --> 00:14:36,118
Yes

264
00:14:36,118 --> 00:14:38,118
It's really like that

265
00:14:38,118 --> 00:14:40,118
It's really like that

266
00:14:40,118 --> 00:14:45,118
The third place of the narcissist
ranking among the members is

267
00:14:45,118 --> 00:14:47,118
The third place is

268
00:14:51,118 --> 00:14:54,118
The third place is Matsumoto-san

269
00:14:54,118 --> 00:14:56,118
Yay

270
00:14:56,118 --> 00:14:59,118
Show us your drawing

271
00:14:59,118 --> 00:15:02,118
This is Sensei's drawing

272
00:15:02,118 --> 00:15:06,118
Matsuno Noe, who drew himself climbing
Mt. Fuji

273
00:15:06,118 --> 00:15:09,118
What is his true psychology?

274
00:15:09,118 --> 00:15:11,118
He climbed to the eighth place

275
00:15:11,118 --> 00:15:14,118
He climbed to the seventh or eighth
place

276
00:15:14,118 --> 00:15:17,118
He thought that his era was coming

277
00:15:17,118 --> 00:15:20,118
The leader

278
00:15:20,118 --> 00:15:22,118
He climbed

279
00:15:22,118 --> 00:15:24,118
He climbed to the top

280
00:15:24,118 --> 00:15:27,118
But he is relatively small

281
00:15:27,118 --> 00:15:33,118
He is so humble that he doesn't show his
ambition

282
00:15:33,118 --> 00:15:35,118
I see

283
00:15:35,118 --> 00:15:37,118
But he has ambition

284
00:15:37,118 --> 00:15:39,118
He climbed the stairs of ambition

285
00:15:39,118 --> 00:15:43,266
But ambition is important

286
00:15:43,266 --> 00:15:46,766
The last one is the leader of the team.

287
00:15:46,766 --> 00:15:51,266
The Narcissist is the best of the
shrimp.

288
00:15:52,266 --> 00:15:55,766
Please announce the winner.

289
00:15:55,766 --> 00:16:00,266
Kashiwagi or Yasumoto?

290
00:16:00,266 --> 00:16:02,266
Which one is it?

291
00:16:02,266 --> 00:16:15,266
Narcissist No.1 is...

292
00:16:15,866 --> 00:16:17,866
Kashiwagi

293
00:16:17,866 --> 00:16:22,866
The first one is Narcissus

294
00:16:22,866 --> 00:16:26,866
Here are the two pictures

295
00:16:26,866 --> 00:16:32,866
They are placed near Mt. Fuji and draw
themselves big

296
00:16:32,866 --> 00:16:39,866
But Kashiwagi is drawing himself big so
Narcissus is more likely

297
00:16:39,866 --> 00:16:43,866
Narcissus is the best among the Eri

298
00:16:43,866 --> 00:16:48,866
The teacher has a message for them

299
00:16:48,866 --> 00:16:55,866
Yasumoto and Kashiwagi are not touching
the mountain directly

300
00:16:55,866 --> 00:16:59,866
They are floating in the air

301
00:16:59,866 --> 00:17:01,866
What does it mean?

302
00:17:01,866 --> 00:17:05,866
It means that they are not in the air

303
00:17:05,866 --> 00:17:09,866
I see, they are not in the air

304
00:17:09,866 --> 00:17:13,866
You are so bad

305
00:17:13,866 --> 00:17:17,866
The second psychological test

306
00:17:17,866 --> 00:17:21,866
We have prepared some tools

307
00:17:21,866 --> 00:17:25,866
The next one is the psychological test

308
00:17:25,866 --> 00:17:30,866
They will choose the tools

309
00:17:30,866 --> 00:17:32,866
What are they?

310
00:17:32,866 --> 00:17:35,866
Let's start the diagnosis

311
00:17:35,866 --> 00:17:39,866
Choose the tools you like

312
00:17:39,866 --> 00:17:42,866
Let's go straight

313
00:17:42,866 --> 00:17:47,866
The members are having a complex

314
00:17:47,866 --> 00:17:51,866
The class president looks good

315
00:17:51,866 --> 00:17:54,866
Ready, go

316
00:17:54,866 --> 00:17:57,866
Good

317
00:17:57,866 --> 00:17:59,866
You are not in the mood

318
00:17:59,866 --> 00:18:02,866
The class president is powerful

319
00:18:02,866 --> 00:18:06,866
He looks good

320
00:18:06,866 --> 00:18:12,866
Yasumoto is like BEMU BELA BELO

321
00:18:12,866 --> 00:18:16,866
Hiroto looks good

322
00:18:16,866 --> 00:18:19,866
Mayama is scared

323
00:18:19,866 --> 00:18:22,866
He doesn't know who he is

324
00:18:22,866 --> 00:18:25,866
Mayama matches the costume

325
00:18:25,866 --> 00:18:29,866
What do you know?

326
00:18:29,866 --> 00:18:37,866
You can tell which one is complex by
which one you wear

327
00:18:37,866 --> 00:18:40,866
What does it mean?

328
00:18:40,866 --> 00:18:47,866
It's not like you wear glasses and your
eyes are complex

329
00:18:47,866 --> 00:18:49,866
Really?

330
00:18:49,866 --> 00:18:50,082
Thank you for watching

331
00:18:50,082 --> 00:18:52,082
From the place where the child was
hiding,

332
00:18:52,082 --> 00:18:55,582
he will read the complex that the person
is holding.

333
00:18:56,582 --> 00:19:00,082
What kind of worries does he have?

334
00:19:00,082 --> 00:19:02,082
Analyze the truth.

335
00:19:02,082 --> 00:19:04,082
First of all,

336
00:19:05,082 --> 00:19:08,582
The person who chose the wig and hid his
head.

337
00:19:08,582 --> 00:19:11,082
Yasumoto and Hoshi.

338
00:19:11,082 --> 00:19:13,082
What about Mayama?

339
00:19:13,082 --> 00:19:15,082
He also goes into the wig group.

340
00:19:15,082 --> 00:19:17,082
He hides his hair.

341
00:19:17,082 --> 00:19:20,082
The person who chose the wig.

342
00:19:20,082 --> 00:19:23,082
He has a complex to the charm of women.

343
00:19:23,082 --> 00:19:25,082
Not like a woman?

344
00:19:25,082 --> 00:19:29,082
I think I'm not sexy enough.

345
00:19:29,082 --> 00:19:31,082
That part is a bit complex.

346
00:19:31,082 --> 00:19:33,082
It's right.

347
00:19:33,082 --> 00:19:34,082
Yasumoto.

348
00:19:34,082 --> 00:19:36,082
It's right.

349
00:19:36,082 --> 00:19:39,082
Hoshino is the most feminine among the
members.

350
00:19:41,082 --> 00:19:43,082
He is aiming for the girl.

351
00:19:43,082 --> 00:19:47,082
He is the most feminine.

352
00:19:47,082 --> 00:19:49,082
I'm sorry.

353
00:19:49,082 --> 00:19:51,082
Can I not look at Yasumoto?

354
00:19:51,082 --> 00:19:53,082
Please look at me.

355
00:19:53,082 --> 00:19:56,082
Next, Hid his eyes.

356
00:19:56,082 --> 00:19:58,082
Matsu and Kobayashi.

357
00:19:58,082 --> 00:20:01,082
And Mayama's complex.

358
00:20:01,082 --> 00:20:06,082
Eyes are the person's personality.

359
00:20:06,082 --> 00:20:11,082
The complex is that he can't show his
true self.

360
00:20:11,082 --> 00:20:17,082
He is acting a bit too much.

361
00:20:17,082 --> 00:20:20,082
Are you all being forced?

362
00:20:20,082 --> 00:20:23,082
He is the one who is the most reluctant.

363
00:20:23,082 --> 00:20:26,082
Kobayashi is the one who is the most
reluctant.

364
00:20:26,082 --> 00:20:28,082
Really?

365
00:20:28,082 --> 00:20:29,082
Really?

366
00:20:29,082 --> 00:20:32,082
The party shoes look the best on him.

367
00:20:32,082 --> 00:20:35,082
Party.

368
00:20:35,082 --> 00:20:37,082
You just said party.

369
00:20:37,082 --> 00:20:40,082
Boss, are you acting?

370
00:20:40,082 --> 00:20:42,082
What?

371
00:20:42,082 --> 00:20:44,082
You are acting.

372
00:20:44,082 --> 00:20:46,082
I'm acting.

373
00:20:46,082 --> 00:20:48,082
Mayama is acting too?

374
00:20:48,082 --> 00:20:52,082
I can't read Mayama's expression.

375
00:20:53,082 --> 00:20:58,082
Next, Kobayashi and Nakayama are hiding
their flowers.

376
00:20:58,082 --> 00:21:01,082
And Mayama's complex is...

377
00:21:01,082 --> 00:21:07,082
Flowers represent the social evaluation.

378
00:21:07,082 --> 00:21:13,082
So the complex is that they are not
recognized as adults.

379
00:21:13,082 --> 00:21:15,082
I want to be recognized.

380
00:21:15,082 --> 00:21:20,418
They are still under the age.

381
00:21:20,418 --> 00:21:22,418
I still want to think that way.

382
00:21:22,418 --> 00:21:25,418
But I can't believe that the other
person is the same age as me.

383
00:21:25,418 --> 00:21:26,418
What is it?

384
00:21:26,418 --> 00:21:28,418
Mayama is full of complexes.

385
00:21:28,418 --> 00:21:32,418
Even if it's a lump, it's a head, eyes,
nose.

386
00:21:32,418 --> 00:21:33,418
That's amazing.

387
00:21:34,418 --> 00:21:36,418
What? My shoulders are shaking.

388
00:21:36,418 --> 00:21:38,418
Are you laughing or crying?

389
00:21:38,418 --> 00:21:39,418
Which one?

390
00:21:40,418 --> 00:21:43,418
Mayama chose a tool that can cover all
faces.

391
00:21:43,418 --> 00:21:48,418
The true truth was a lump of complexes.

392
00:21:48,418 --> 00:21:52,418
Ebichu Game Quest

393
00:21:55,418 --> 00:21:58,418
Ebichu's game project is in progress.

394
00:22:00,418 --> 00:22:04,418
Last time, the prototype version of
Ebichu's game was finally announced.

395
00:22:05,418 --> 00:22:09,418
Ebichu members will appear as characters
in the game.

396
00:22:09,418 --> 00:22:11,418
So this time,

397
00:22:11,418 --> 00:22:15,418
Ebichu members' character design was
announced.

398
00:22:15,418 --> 00:22:18,418
We have created 8 characters.

399
00:22:19,418 --> 00:22:21,418
We will announce them.

400
00:22:22,418 --> 00:22:24,418
First, Mayama.

401
00:22:26,418 --> 00:22:29,418
First, Mayama's character, who likes
Ebichu the most.

402
00:22:29,418 --> 00:22:31,418
Here it is.

403
00:22:32,418 --> 00:22:34,418
It's cute.

404
00:22:35,418 --> 00:22:37,418
It's cute.

405
00:22:37,418 --> 00:22:39,418
It feels like an anime.

406
00:22:39,418 --> 00:22:41,418
I understand.

407
00:22:41,418 --> 00:22:43,418
Mayama will understand.

408
00:22:43,418 --> 00:22:46,418
Next, Hiroto's character design.

409
00:22:47,418 --> 00:22:48,418
Here it is.

410
00:22:49,418 --> 00:22:51,418
It's Ai.

411
00:22:51,418 --> 00:22:53,418
It's like Ai.

412
00:22:53,418 --> 00:22:54,418
It's cute.

413
00:22:54,418 --> 00:22:57,418
I'll do my best in this game.

414
00:22:58,418 --> 00:22:59,418
It's similar.

415
00:22:59,418 --> 00:23:00,418
It's similar.

416
00:23:00,418 --> 00:23:01,418
It's similar.

417
00:23:01,418 --> 00:23:03,418
Is it a hair style?

418
00:23:03,418 --> 00:23:06,418
Next, Matsuno's character design.

419
00:23:07,418 --> 00:23:09,418
Matsuno's character design.

420
00:23:09,418 --> 00:23:11,418
Here it is.

421
00:23:11,418 --> 00:23:12,418
It's cute.

422
00:23:12,418 --> 00:23:13,418
It's clean.

423
00:23:13,418 --> 00:23:15,418
It's popular.

424
00:23:15,418 --> 00:23:17,418
It's popular with this kind of
character.

425
00:23:17,418 --> 00:23:19,418
It's popular with people who like this
kind of character.

426
00:23:19,418 --> 00:23:21,418
Ebichu's half-up ribbon is cute.

427
00:23:21,418 --> 00:23:22,418
It's cute.

428
00:23:22,418 --> 00:23:24,418
It's like a person who can do it.

429
00:23:24,418 --> 00:23:25,418
I did it.

430
00:23:25,418 --> 00:23:27,418
It's like a person who can do it.

431
00:23:27,418 --> 00:23:29,418
I want to see it.

432
00:23:29,418 --> 00:23:32,418
Next, Kashiwagi's character design.

433
00:23:33,418 --> 00:23:34,418
Here it is.

434
00:23:35,418 --> 00:23:36,418
It's cute.

435
00:23:36,418 --> 00:23:38,418
It's a good character.

436
00:23:38,418 --> 00:23:40,418
It's like a globe.

437
00:23:40,418 --> 00:23:42,418
It's really strong.

438
00:23:42,418 --> 00:23:44,418
It's like a person who can do it.

439
00:23:44,418 --> 00:23:46,418
It's like a mysterious globe.

440
00:23:46,418 --> 00:23:48,418
It's strong.

441
00:23:48,418 --> 00:23:50,418
It's cute.

442
00:23:50,418 --> 00:23:51,810
It's amazing.

443
00:23:51,810 --> 00:23:54,930
By the way, the other four members

444
00:23:54,930 --> 00:23:55,950
Everyone

445
00:23:56,750 --> 00:23:59,150
What is the character design of these
four people?

446
00:23:59,150 --> 00:24:00,350
What is the character design of these
four people?

447
00:24:00,350 --> 00:24:01,590
It looks like this

448
00:24:01,590 --> 00:24:02,890
What is the character design of these
four people?

449
00:24:02,890 --> 00:24:03,890
Mia-chan

450
00:24:03,890 --> 00:24:06,310
The hair is like a bow

451
00:24:06,310 --> 00:24:07,970
Tico is cute

452
00:24:07,970 --> 00:24:09,970
Yuchan is dangerous

453
00:24:09,970 --> 00:24:11,970
But Kaho is cute

454
00:24:11,970 --> 00:24:12,970
Kaho

455
00:24:12,970 --> 00:24:14,470
Ayaka and Kaho

456
00:24:14,470 --> 00:24:16,470
They are very friendly

457
00:24:16,470 --> 00:24:21,970
The game producer is also very excited
about the members

458
00:24:21,970 --> 00:24:24,970
I'm very happy that you've said so far

459
00:24:24,970 --> 00:24:29,970
I'm going to brush up a little more to
show you guys

460
00:24:29,970 --> 00:24:32,970
Thank you

461
00:24:32,970 --> 00:24:37,470
Don't miss the latest information

462
00:24:37,470 --> 00:24:44,470
Next time, we will perform the ultimate
test that reveals the true psychology of
shrimp

463
00:24:44,470 --> 00:24:46,470
Basically, it's about expressing love

464
00:24:46,470 --> 00:24:48,470
Oh my

465
00:24:48,470 --> 00:24:52,470
The members are in love with the members
in the dream

466
00:24:52,470 --> 00:24:56,470
In addition, in the psychological battle
to read the mind

467
00:25:01,470 --> 00:25:05,470
What is the member today?

468
00:25:05,470 --> 00:25:09,470
And to those who missed the shrimp-
chewed tastas

469
00:25:09,470 --> 00:25:15,470
The shrimp-chewed tastas are being
released on the Star Dust channel, a
low-cost video distribution site

470
00:25:15,470 --> 00:25:17,470
Where is the shrimp-chewed tastas?

471
00:25:17,470 --> 00:25:18,470
I don't know

472
00:25:18,470 --> 00:25:20,470
I don't think you'll find it from the
beginning

473
00:25:20,470 --> 00:25:24,470
That scene is available for free for 400
yen a month

474
00:25:24,470 --> 00:25:30,470
In addition, there are a lot of
exclusive videos that are not released

475
00:25:30,470 --> 00:25:31,470
Now?

00:25:31,470 --> 00:25:34,470
