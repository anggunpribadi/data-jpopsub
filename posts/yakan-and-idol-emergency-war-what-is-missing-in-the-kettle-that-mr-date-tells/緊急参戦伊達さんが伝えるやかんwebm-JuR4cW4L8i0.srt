00:00:00,474 --> 00:00:08,474
I took a picture of the night view of
Date-san and the idol of the next year's
broadcast.

2
00:00:08,474 --> 00:00:10,474
It was fun.

3
00:00:10,474 --> 00:00:12,474
I took a picture.

4
00:00:12,474 --> 00:00:18,474
I thought, but this night view is
lonely.

5
00:00:18,474 --> 00:00:22,474
So I'm going to make myself a little
cuter and go home.

6
00:00:22,474 --> 00:00:28,474
I'm going to draw a face on the night
view.

7
00:00:29,496 --> 00:00:32,496
It's hard to get close to him, isn't it?

8
00:00:33,496 --> 00:00:36,496
I'm going to make him more friendly and
cute.

9
00:00:37,496 --> 00:00:38,496
Please look forward to it.

10
00:00:42,496 --> 00:00:43,496
I'm going to draw a face on the night
view.

11
00:00:47,496 --> 00:00:48,496
Night view.

12
00:00:50,496 --> 00:00:51,496
I'm going to draw a face on the night
view.

13
00:00:53,496 --> 00:00:54,496
I'm going to draw a face on the night
view.

14
00:00:54,496 --> 00:00:55,496
No, no, no.

15
00:00:55,496 --> 00:00:56,496
I'm going to draw a face on the night
view.

16
00:00:57,712 --> 00:01:05,712
I want to buy it here.

17
00:01:05,712 --> 00:01:07,712
This is this.

18
00:01:07,712 --> 00:01:10,712
It wasn't like this.

19
00:01:10,712 --> 00:01:11,712
It was like this.

20
00:01:11,712 --> 00:01:13,712
I'm going to be a person.

21
00:01:13,712 --> 00:01:17,712
I know you're taking it like this.

22
00:01:17,712 --> 00:01:19,712
I was taking it like this.

23
00:01:19,712 --> 00:01:27,328
I see.

24
00:01:28,328 --> 00:01:30,328
I'm also a big fan of you.

25
00:01:30,328 --> 00:01:33,328
I'll call you Yakan-chan, and you'll
call me Yakan-kun.

26
00:01:33,328 --> 00:01:35,328
Please call me Yakan-chan someday.

27
00:01:35,328 --> 00:01:37,328
I don't know.

28
00:01:37,328 --> 00:01:39,328
I see.

29
00:01:40,328 --> 00:01:42,328
What kind of face do you like?

30
00:01:42,328 --> 00:01:44,328
I think it's a cute face.

31
00:01:44,328 --> 00:01:46,560
Is it fun?

32
00:01:47,560 --> 00:01:49,560
You're bringing it to me.

33
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:51,560
Really?

34
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:53,560
I'm happy.

35
00:01:57,560 --> 00:01:59,560
Do you have eyelashes?

36
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:06,560
I think the night view is hot.

37
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:09,560
I'll put my face on fire.

38
00:02:09,560 --> 00:02:11,560
It's done.

39
00:02:11,560 --> 00:02:12,560
Bye.

40
00:02:16,154 --> 00:02:18,154
This is Yua Mikami's night view channel!

41
00:02:20,154 --> 00:02:23,154
I didn't think I'd be able to shoot a
video like this.

42
00:02:23,154 --> 00:02:26,154
You can shoot like this, and you can
shoot like this.

43
00:02:26,154 --> 00:02:30,544
Idol's repertory.

44
00:02:31,544 --> 00:02:33,544
Is it okay to be a detective?

45
00:02:33,544 --> 00:02:35,544
I'm a detective.

46
00:02:35,544 --> 00:02:37,544
I'm a detective of YAKANT IDOL.

47
00:02:37,544 --> 00:02:39,544
I'll be back.

48
00:02:39,544 --> 00:02:41,544
Are you okay?

49
00:02:41,544 --> 00:02:43,544
This is a notice.

50
00:02:43,544 --> 00:02:45,544
Oh, my God.

51
00:02:45,544 --> 00:02:53,544
Please continue to support YAKANT IDOL.
