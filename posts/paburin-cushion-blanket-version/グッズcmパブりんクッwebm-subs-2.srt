1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
I'm sleepy.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:06,000
I'm sleepy.

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:10,000
I'm sleepy too.

4
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:17,000
Hey, everyone!

5
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:21,000
Can you hear me?

6
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:29,000
Hey, everyone! I'm here!

7
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:37,000
Kanamin, Juri-chan, Hito-chan, Hiyorin,
over here!

8
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:42,000
I think I've heard of them before.

9
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Oh, Tamarin?

10
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:47,000
Yes?

11
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:51,000
What are you doing here?

12
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:56,000
Kanamin and Juri-chan said they were
sleepy, so we came here.

13
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
We came?

14
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:01,000
What do you mean you came here because
you said you were sleepy?

15
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,000
Why did you become a bubbling cushion?

16
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:07,000
Actually, bubbling is not just a
cushion.

17
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:08,000
Hey, Juri-chan!

18
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
Don't say it like you're a soldier.

19
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:13,000
Can you try spreading the cushion?

20
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Juri?

21
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:18,000
It's not just a cushion.

22
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:28,000
Wow! It's a blanket!

23
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:35,000
Actually, it's not just a cushion, it's
a blanket too.

24
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,000
Wow, it's cute.

25
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,000
It's really convenient.

26
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:43,000
I'm getting sleepy.

27
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,000
Juri?

28
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,000
Juri is sleeping.

29
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:54,000
This blanket is really cute.

30
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:58,000
It's convenient because you can put it
under your chair during a concert.

31
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,000
That's true.

32
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:02,000
I'm going to borrow it.

33
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:08,000
I'm suddenly sleepy.

34
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:11,000
Kanamin?

35
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:14,000
They both fell asleep.

36
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
This is magic.

37
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
I made a mistake.

38
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:25,000
Maybe bubbling became a cushion blanket
and protected us.

39
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:29,000
Piyo was talking in bubbling's voice.

40
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:32,000
What?

41
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:35,000
I'll protect you all anytime.

42
00:02:35,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Bubbling's cushion blanket.
