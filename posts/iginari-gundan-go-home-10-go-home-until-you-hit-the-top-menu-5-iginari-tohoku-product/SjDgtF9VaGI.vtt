00:00.000 --> 00:02.000
 Thank you for watching!

00:02.010 --> 00:04.010
 Good morning.

00:04.010 --> 00:06.010
 Good morning.

00:06.010 --> 00:10.010
 Today, we are going to visit a
restaurant called Bachika.

00:10.010 --> 00:12.010
 We are going to visit this restaurant.

00:12.010 --> 00:14.010
 We are going to visit this restaurant.

00:14.010 --> 00:16.010
 We are going to visit this restaurant.

00:16.010 --> 00:18.010
 I have been thinking about what to do
for the day.

00:18.010 --> 00:20.010
 I have been thinking about what to do
for the day.

00:20.010 --> 00:22.010
 I have come up with a new idea.

00:22.010 --> 00:24.010
 A new idea?

00:24.010 --> 00:26.010
 I want to do it.

00:26.010 --> 00:28.010
 What is it?

00:28.010 --> 00:32.010
 You can't go home until you get the top
rank in the ranking of the restaurant.

00:32.010 --> 00:34.010
 I have heard of it.

00:34.010 --> 00:36.010
 I am not a man.

00:36.010 --> 00:38.010
 The title of this video is

00:38.010 --> 00:42.010
 You can't go home until you get the top
rank in the ranking of the restaurant.

00:42.010 --> 00:44.010
 You can't go home.

00:44.010 --> 00:46.010
 You can't go home.

00:46.010 --> 00:48.010
 You can't go home.

00:48.010 --> 00:50.010
 It is a new idea.

00:50.010 --> 00:52.010
 I think you don't know what it is
unless you explain it.

00:52.010 --> 00:54.010
 I don't know.

00:54.010 --> 00:56.010
 I don't know.

00:56.010 --> 01:02.010
 You can't go home until you get the top
rank in the ranking of the restaurant.

01:02.010 --> 01:04.010
 I see.

01:04.010 --> 01:06.010
 I see.

01:06.010 --> 01:10.010
 You can't go home until you finish
eating the food.

01:10.010 --> 01:12.010
 I see.

01:12.010 --> 01:14.010
 I am not sure if I am explaining it.

01:14.010 --> 01:16.010
 I don't know what it is.

01:16.010 --> 01:18.010
 I don't know what it is.

01:18.010 --> 01:20.010
 I don't know what it is.

01:20.010 --> 01:22.010
 I can see 2 seconds ahead.

01:22.010 --> 01:24.010
 I can see 2 seconds ahead.

01:24.010 --> 01:26.010
 This is a new idea.

01:26.010 --> 01:28.010
 You are smart.

01:28.010 --> 01:30.010
 I didn't know that.

01:30.010 --> 01:32.010
 I am surprised.

01:32.010 --> 01:34.010
 Let's order the menu.

01:34.010 --> 01:36.010
 Let's order the menu.

01:36.010 --> 01:38.010
 I want to eat this.

01:38.010 --> 01:40.010
 I think it is common sense.

01:40.010 --> 01:42.010
 I want to eat this.

01:42.010 --> 01:44.010
 I think it is common sense.

01:44.010 --> 01:46.010
 I think it is fried potato.

01:46.010 --> 01:48.010
 If it is not fried potato, I am not
sure.

01:48.010 --> 01:52.010
 Yuna has appeared on a program before.

01:52.010 --> 01:54.010
 I see.

01:54.010 --> 01:56.010
 Is there a special menu?

01:56.010 --> 01:58.010
 Yes, there is.

01:58.010 --> 02:00.010
 I have to change my plan.

02:00.010 --> 02:02.010
 I have to change my plan.

02:02.010 --> 02:04.010
 There are potatoes in the menu.

02:04.010 --> 02:06.010
 I want to eat more.

02:06.010 --> 02:08.010
 It is popular.

02:08.010 --> 02:10.010
 This is a program.

02:10.010 --> 02:12.010
 This is a program.

02:12.010 --> 02:14.010
 I want to eat more.

02:14.010 --> 02:16.010
 I want to eat more.

02:16.010 --> 02:18.010
 I am sorry.

02:18.010 --> 02:20.010
 It is going to be long.

02:20.010 --> 02:22.010
 Shall we change the menu to vegetables?

02:22.010 --> 02:24.010
 That's good.

02:24.010 --> 02:26.010
 There is a pickled cucumber.

02:26.010 --> 02:28.010
 What do you like?

02:28.010 --> 02:30.010
 How about pickled cucumber?

02:30.010 --> 02:32.010
 I like it.

02:32.010 --> 02:34.010
 Shall we order?

02:34.010 --> 02:36.010
 I want to eat pickled cucumber.

02:36.010 --> 02:38.010
 Please.

02:38.010 --> 02:40.010
 Let's do our best.

02:40.010 --> 02:42.458

02:42.458 --> 02:45.458
 What age group do you think will come?

02:45.458 --> 02:48.458
 I want to hear that.

02:48.458 --> 02:51.458
 What age group do you think will come?

02:51.458 --> 02:55.458
 People in their 30s to 60s.

02:55.458 --> 02:58.458
 People in their 40s to 60s.

02:58.458 --> 03:00.458
 I see.

03:00.458 --> 03:02.458
 I'm not good at it.

03:02.458 --> 03:04.458
 I'm not good at it.

03:04.458 --> 03:06.458
 I want a soft one.

03:06.458 --> 03:08.458
 You are so greedy.

03:08.458 --> 03:10.458
 You are so greedy.

03:10.458 --> 03:12.458
 I got it.

03:12.458 --> 03:14.458
 I got it.

03:14.458 --> 03:16.458
 Thank you.

03:16.458 --> 03:18.458
 I'll eat it with chopsticks.

03:20.458 --> 03:22.458
 Thank you.

03:22.458 --> 03:24.458
 I'll enjoy it.

03:24.458 --> 03:26.458
 I'll enjoy it.

03:26.458 --> 03:28.458
 I did it.

03:28.458 --> 03:30.458
 I'll enjoy it.

03:30.458 --> 03:32.458
 I can smell the flavor of the food.

03:32.458 --> 03:34.458
 It's delicious.

03:34.458 --> 03:36.458
 It's overwhelming.

03:36.458 --> 03:38.458
 It's delicious.

03:38.458 --> 03:40.458
 I can taste the flavor.

03:40.458 --> 03:42.458
 I like the tea shop.

03:42.458 --> 03:44.458
 It was delicious.

03:46.458 --> 03:48.458
 It was delicious.

03:48.458 --> 03:50.458
 It was really delicious.

03:50.458 --> 03:52.458
 I think I'm in the third place.

03:52.458 --> 03:54.458
 I think so.

03:54.458 --> 03:56.458
 I think so.

03:56.458 --> 03:58.458
 I feel like I'm in the third place.

03:58.458 --> 04:00.458
 I think so.

04:00.458 --> 04:02.458
 Let's go to the third place.

04:02.458 --> 04:04.458
 I'm in the third place.

04:04.458 --> 04:08.458
 I'm in the third place.

04:11.064 --> 04:12.064
 You are not in the third place.

04:13.064 --> 04:14.064
 No way!

04:15.064 --> 04:16.064
 You don't eat it, do you?

04:17.064 --> 04:18.064
 You are not in the third place.

04:19.064 --> 04:20.064
 Really?

04:21.064 --> 04:22.064
 I eat 5 pieces of it at once.

04:23.064 --> 04:24.064
 It's so delicious.

04:25.064 --> 04:26.064
 It's really delicious.

04:26.064 --> 04:27.064
 You can't choose the next menu.

04:28.064 --> 04:29.064
 I see.

04:32.064 --> 04:33.064
 I've decided on the first one.

04:34.064 --> 04:35.064
 Massage.

04:36.064 --> 04:37.064
 I think I'm in the third place.

04:37.064 --> 04:38.064
 I think I'm in the third place.

04:39.064 --> 04:40.064
 I'm in the third place.

04:41.064 --> 04:42.064
 Can I choose the massage?

04:43.064 --> 04:44.064
 Yes, you can.

04:45.064 --> 04:46.064
 Massage, please.

04:50.064 --> 04:51.064
 Death by Nae flavor?

04:52.064 --> 04:56.064
 Death by Nae flavor, condame flavor,
salt butter flavor.

04:57.064 --> 04:58.064
 It's a substitute.

04:59.064 --> 05:00.064
 It's a substitute.

05:01.064 --> 05:02.064
 It's a substitute.

05:03.064 --> 05:04.064
 I wonder what Yura is doing.

05:04.064 --> 05:05.064
 I wonder what she is doing.

05:06.064 --> 05:09.064
 The lighting is so calm that I feel
calm.

05:10.064 --> 05:11.064
 I know what you mean.

05:13.064 --> 05:15.064
 When the lighting is like this, I feel
like this.

05:17.064 --> 05:18.064
 I feel like I'm going to faint.

05:19.064 --> 05:20.064
 It's like tea.

05:21.064 --> 05:22.064
 There are many things.

05:23.064 --> 05:24.064
 The atmosphere and the lighting.

05:25.064 --> 05:26.064
 The lighting is important.

05:27.064 --> 05:28.064
 It's important.

05:29.064 --> 05:31.064
 Everyone is getting drunk.

05:31.064 --> 05:33.064
 When I see beautiful girls, I get
drunk.

05:35.064 --> 05:36.064
 I hate that.

05:37.064 --> 05:38.064
 I'm going to start singing.

05:39.064 --> 05:40.064
 I'm going to sing while I'm taking a
video.

05:41.064 --> 05:42.064
 I'm getting drunk.

05:43.064 --> 05:44.064
 We sang with our hands together.

05:44.064 --> 05:50.842
 Please subscribe to this channel!

06:01.946 --> 06:03.946
 What?

06:03.946 --> 06:05.946
 I'm curious.

06:05.946 --> 06:07.946
 I'm curious.

06:07.946 --> 06:09.946
 I'm curious.

06:09.946 --> 06:11.946
 I'm curious.

06:11.946 --> 06:13.946
 The last one.

06:13.946 --> 06:15.946
 It's fast.

06:15.946 --> 06:17.946
 It looks delicious.

06:17.946 --> 06:19.946
 Is this...

06:19.946 --> 06:21.946
 Pony?

06:21.946 --> 06:23.946
 Pony.

06:23.946 --> 06:25.946
 Please suck it.

06:25.946 --> 06:27.946
 Thank you for the meal.

06:27.946 --> 06:29.946
 I've never eaten it.

06:29.946 --> 06:31.946
 Is it your first time?

06:31.946 --> 06:33.946
 What part is this?

06:35.946 --> 06:37.946
 Red meat.

06:37.946 --> 06:39.946
 I've never seen it.

06:39.946 --> 06:41.946
 The white part is the bone.

06:41.946 --> 06:43.946
 What?

06:43.946 --> 06:45.946
 What?

06:45.946 --> 06:47.946
 Is this the bone?

06:47.946 --> 06:49.946
 It's the bone.

06:49.946 --> 06:51.946
 It's the bone.

06:51.946 --> 06:53.946
 The red part is mixed.

06:53.946 --> 06:55.946
 It's the bone.

06:55.946 --> 06:57.946
 The bone?

06:57.946 --> 06:59.946
 What are you doing?

06:59.946 --> 07:01.946
 It's the bone.

07:01.946 --> 07:03.946
 It's the bone.

07:03.946 --> 07:05.946
 It's the bone.

07:05.946 --> 07:07.946
 It's the bone.

07:07.946 --> 07:09.946
 Thank you for the meal.

07:09.946 --> 07:11.946
 Thank you for the meal.

07:11.946 --> 07:13.946
 I'm scared.

07:13.946 --> 07:15.946
 It's my first time.

07:15.946 --> 07:17.946
 I'll put it on the tea.

07:17.946 --> 07:19.946
 It's hard.

07:19.946 --> 07:21.946
 It's my favorite.

07:21.946 --> 07:23.946
 It's delicious.

07:23.946 --> 07:25.946
 It's thick.

07:25.946 --> 07:27.946
 How is it?

07:27.946 --> 07:29.946
 It's mild.

07:29.946 --> 07:31.946
 It's delicious.

07:31.946 --> 07:33.946
 I'll finish eating.

07:35.946 --> 07:37.946
 I've finished eating.

07:37.946 --> 07:43.232
 Thank you for watching.

 What should we do?

08:08.232 --> 08:10.232
 I'm going to eat something light.

08:10.232 --> 08:11.232
 We can do it.

08:11.232 --> 08:13.232
 I want to eat something.

08:13.232 --> 08:14.232

 It's Sosuyaki-Soba.

09:33.360 --> 09:34.360
 It's Sosuyaki-Soba.

09:35.360 --> 09:36.360
 It's Sosuyaki-Soba.

09:40.360 --> 09:42.360
 Sosuyaki-Soba with fried egg.

09:42.360 --> 09:47.866
 The order of fried egg is...

09:47.866 --> 09:49.866
 I'm sorry.

09:49.866 --> 09:51.866
 What?

09:51.866 --> 09:53.866
 You are lying.

09:53.866 --> 09:55.866
 You are a fool.

09:55.866 --> 09:57.866
 I'm sorry.

09:57.866 --> 09:59.866
 You are a fool.

09:59.866 --> 10:01.866
 I'm a fool.

10:01.866 --> 10:03.866
 Really?

10:03.866 --> 10:05.866
 Let's move on.

10:05.866 --> 10:07.866
 The next is...

10:07.866 --> 10:09.866
 What?

10:09.866 --> 10:11.866
 It's a little thick.

10:11.866 --> 10:13.866
 100 points.

10:13.866 --> 10:15.866
 Let's eat.

10:15.866 --> 10:17.866
 Thank you for the meal.

10:17.866 --> 10:19.866
 What did you say?

10:21.866 --> 10:23.866
 It looks delicious.

10:23.866 --> 10:25.866
 It's delicious.

10:27.760 --> 10:29.760
 It's so soft and chewy.

10:29.760 --> 10:31.760
 It's so soft and chewy.

10:31.760 --> 10:33.760
 It was great.

10:33.760 --> 10:35.760
 Thank you for the meal.

10:36.872 --> 10:38.872
 I think it's really in there.

10:38.872 --> 10:42.872
 The ranking of the fried potatoes is...

10:42.872 --> 10:44.872
 What?

10:44.872 --> 10:46.872
 Wait a minute.

10:46.872 --> 10:48.872
 What are you eating?

10:48.872 --> 10:51.872
 What are you eating?

10:51.872 --> 10:52.872
 This is definitely...

10:52.872 --> 10:56.872
 This is out of the question, so let's
guess.

10:56.872 --> 10:57.872
 I agree.

10:57.872 --> 10:59.872
 Ham katsu...

10:59.872 --> 11:01.872
 I think ham katsu is in there.

11:01.872 --> 11:03.872
 I think it's the hottest ham katsu in
Japan.

11:03.872 --> 11:05.872
 I'm curious.

11:05.872 --> 11:07.872
 I'm wondering how hot it is.

11:07.872 --> 11:09.872
 I'm curious, too.

11:09.872 --> 11:11.872
 Ready, go.

11:11.872 --> 11:14.872
 The hottest ham katsu in Miyagi.

11:14.872 --> 11:15.872
 I'm confused.

11:15.872 --> 11:17.600
 Please subscribe!

11:19.296 --> 11:21.296
 It's a crab!

11:21.296 --> 11:23.296
 It's hot!

11:23.296 --> 11:25.296
 Look!

11:25.296 --> 11:27.296
 I love sauce!

11:27.296 --> 11:29.296
 I love sauce!

11:29.296 --> 11:31.296
 Itadakimasu!

11:31.296 --> 11:33.296
 It's 3 pieces!

11:33.296 --> 11:35.296
 How long is it?

11:35.296 --> 11:37.296
 It's 5cm.

11:37.296 --> 11:39.296
 What?

11:39.296 --> 11:41.296
 If I had one more, it would be 10cm.

11:41.296 --> 11:43.296
 It's easy to carry.

11:43.296 --> 11:45.296
 I can tell it's 10cm.

11:45.296 --> 11:47.296
 I wonder how long it is.

11:47.296 --> 11:49.296
 It's heavy.

11:51.296 --> 11:53.296
 It's heavy, but it's good.

11:53.296 --> 11:55.296
 It's hot.

11:55.296 --> 11:57.296
 It's hot.

11:57.296 --> 11:59.296
 It's hot!

12:01.296 --> 12:03.296
 We finished it.

12:03.296 --> 12:09.296
 The best cutlet in Miyagi is...

12:10.904 --> 12:12.904
 5th place.

12:14.904 --> 12:15.904
 I feel relieved.

12:16.904 --> 12:17.904
 But it's 5th place.

12:18.904 --> 12:20.904
 I'm relieved.

12:21.904 --> 12:22.904
 The best cutlet in Miyagi is...

12:23.904 --> 12:24.904
 The best cutlet in Miyagi is...

12:25.904 --> 12:26.904
 This is also fried egg.

12:28.904 --> 12:29.904
 It's easy to roll the stone.

12:30.904 --> 12:31.904
 It's cold and fun.

12:32.904 --> 12:34.904
 I'll do it with a spirit.

12:36.904 --> 12:37.904
 Let's do it.

12:37.904 --> 12:38.904
 The best cutlet in Miyagi is...

12:39.904 --> 12:40.904
 Fried egg.

12:41.904 --> 12:42.904
 I was motivated.

12:43.904 --> 12:44.904
 Let's eat.

12:53.904 --> 12:54.904
 It's sweet.

12:56.904 --> 12:57.904
 It's rich in flavor.

12:58.904 --> 12:59.904
 I like it.

13:00.904 --> 13:01.904
 Everything is delicious.

13:02.904 --> 13:03.904
 The last bite.

13:03.904 --> 13:04.904
 I'm relieved.

13:04.904 --> 13:06.904
 This is 7th place, isn't it?

13:10.224 --> 13:11.224
 I hope it's not.

13:11.224 --> 13:17.224
 The 10th place of the old-fashioned
Teppan Naporitan is...

13:17.224 --> 13:18.224
 This one.

13:20.224 --> 13:22.224
 I knew it! It's the center!

13:22.224 --> 13:25.224
 Everyone!

13:25.224 --> 13:27.224
 Wait a minute.

13:27.224 --> 13:28.224
 Thank you.

13:28.224 --> 13:30.224
 Thank you so much.

13:30.224 --> 13:32.224
 How many places are left?

13:32.224 --> 13:33.224
 3 places.

13:33.224 --> 13:34.224
 3 places?

13:34.224 --> 13:36.224
 3rd and 4th places are left.

13:37.224 --> 13:38.224
 3rd and 4th places?

13:38.224 --> 13:40.224
 It's enough.

13:40.224 --> 13:42.224
 I'll have the fried chicken, the grated
daikon radish and the ponzu sauce.

13:42.224 --> 13:44.224
 Thank you.

13:45.488 --> 13:47.152
 Please subscribe to the channel.

13:48.152 --> 13:50.152
 Let's eat fried chicken.

13:52.152 --> 13:53.152
 It's spicy.

13:54.152 --> 13:55.152
 It's a thin sliced pepper.

13:56.152 --> 13:57.152
 It smells good.

13:58.152 --> 13:59.152
 Let's eat.

14:00.152 --> 14:01.152
 It's good.

14:02.152 --> 14:03.152
 It's meat juice.

14:04.152 --> 14:06.152
 I think this is the best.

14:07.152 --> 14:08.152
 It's not the best.

14:09.152 --> 14:10.152
 It's the best.

14:11.152 --> 14:12.152
 It's good.

14:13.152 --> 14:14.152
 We finished eating.

14:15.152 --> 14:16.152
 Thank you for the meal.

14:16.152 --> 14:17.152
 It was good.

14:17.152 --> 14:18.152
 It's meat juice.

14:19.152 --> 14:20.152
 That's all for today.

14:21.152 --> 14:22.152
 Thank you for watching.

14:23.152 --> 14:24.152
 We ate all of them.

14:34.368 --> 14:36.448
 Go!

14:37.136 --> 14:39.136
 It's the first time I've heard that.

14:39.136 --> 14:41.136
 The first time I've heard that.

14:43.136 --> 14:45.136
 It's as big as my foot.

14:45.136 --> 14:47.136
 It looks delicious.

14:47.136 --> 14:49.136
 It looks like a pork cutlet.

14:49.136 --> 14:51.136
 It looks delicious.

14:51.136 --> 14:53.136
 It's a pork cutlet with a lot of pork.

14:53.136 --> 14:55.136
 It's good.

14:55.136 --> 14:57.136
 This is a pork cutlet.

14:57.136 --> 14:59.136
 It looks bigger than a pork cutlet.

14:59.136 --> 15:01.136
 Let's eat.

15:03.136 --> 15:05.136
 There's a lot of meat in it.

15:05.136 --> 15:07.136
 I like it.

15:07.136 --> 15:09.136
 I like it.

15:09.136 --> 15:11.136
 I believe this is the sign.

15:11.136 --> 15:13.136
 It looks delicious.

15:13.136 --> 15:15.136
 It's crispy.

15:15.136 --> 15:17.136
 It's very delicious.

15:17.136 --> 15:19.136
 I'm happy.

15:22.202 --> 15:23.888
 Thank you for watching.

15:23.888 --> 15:27.388
 It's all delicious.

15:27.388 --> 15:28.888
 I'll do my best.

15:28.888 --> 15:31.888
 This is for everyone.

15:31.888 --> 15:33.888
 You're kind.

15:35.888 --> 15:38.888
 I'll eat it.

15:41.888 --> 15:43.888
 I'm going to eat it.

15:46.888 --> 15:48.888
 Thank you.

15:48.888 --> 15:51.888
 Thank you.

15:58.330 --> 16:00.330
 The winner is...

16:00.330 --> 16:02.330
 Sano!

16:02.330 --> 16:04.330
 I won!

16:04.330 --> 16:06.330
 Did you really line up the dishes in
order?

16:06.330 --> 16:08.330
 I just happened to do it.

16:08.330 --> 16:10.330
 It's a psychological game.

16:10.330 --> 16:12.330
 It's a psychological game.

16:12.330 --> 16:14.330
 Next, let's eat the aburishime soba.

16:14.330 --> 16:16.330
 Yay!

16:16.330 --> 16:18.330
 The winner is...

16:18.330 --> 16:18.784
 Sano!

16:19.784 --> 16:22.784
 So, we ate 5 kaerema!

16:22.784 --> 16:25.784
 Each one of them was really good.

16:25.784 --> 16:28.784
 Please try them!

16:28.784 --> 16:30.784
 I like them.

16:30.784 --> 16:32.784
