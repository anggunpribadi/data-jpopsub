DEVIl OST

00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,180
Shooting Harmony

4
00:00:06,180 --> 00:00:07,740
I'm hungry.

5
00:00:09,488 --> 00:00:12,488
I got it, I got it

6
00:00:17,488 --> 00:00:19,488
I got it, I got it

7
00:00:19,488 --> 00:00:20,488
I got it

8
00:00:20,488 --> 00:00:21,488
You need to get it

9
00:00:21,488 --> 00:00:22,488
I got it

10
00:00:22,488 --> 00:00:24,488
It's a steamed bun

11
00:00:24,488 --> 00:00:25,488
Only this?

12
00:00:25,488 --> 00:00:30,488
There are two loopholes in 9 steamed
buns

13
00:00:30,488 --> 00:00:31,488
What?

14
00:00:31,488 --> 00:00:34,488
I will announce the contents of the
loopholes first

15
00:00:34,488 --> 00:00:36,488
What is it?

16
00:00:36,488 --> 00:00:37,488
Ta-da

17
00:00:37,488 --> 00:00:39,488
No way

18
00:00:39,488 --> 00:00:41,488
Bye

19
00:00:41,626 --> 00:00:42,626
No, it's impossible.

20
00:00:42,626 --> 00:00:43,626
It's a flounder.

21
00:00:43,626 --> 00:00:44,626
This is a flounder.

22
00:00:44,626 --> 00:00:45,626
It's a flounder.

23
00:00:45,626 --> 00:00:46,626
It's a flounder.

24
00:00:46,626 --> 00:00:47,626
It's a caterpillar.

25
00:00:47,626 --> 00:00:49,626
I don't know what that caterpillar is.

26
00:00:49,626 --> 00:00:51,626
I don't need a caterpillar.

27
00:00:51,626 --> 00:00:52,626
It's a lizard.

28
00:00:52,626 --> 00:00:53,626
I don't need it.

29
00:00:53,626 --> 00:00:54,626
I don't need it.

30
00:00:54,626 --> 00:00:55,626
I don't need it.

31
00:00:55,626 --> 00:00:57,626
Why do you eat that?

32
00:00:57,626 --> 00:00:58,626
It's better not to eat it.

33
00:00:58,626 --> 00:01:00,626
Is a caterpillar that kind of insect?

34
00:01:00,626 --> 00:01:01,626
Oh, it's like a lizard?

35
00:01:01,626 --> 00:01:04,626
Wow, it's not funny.

36
00:01:05,626 --> 00:01:07,626
It's not funny.

37
00:01:07,626 --> 00:01:08,626
Then I'll go.

38
00:01:08,626 --> 00:01:11,626
Don't hold it.

39
00:01:12,626 --> 00:01:14,626
The food has arrived.

40
00:01:15,626 --> 00:01:17,626
I don't know why it's lined up next to
me.

41
00:01:17,626 --> 00:01:19,626
Because you're the first one.

42
00:01:19,626 --> 00:01:20,626
It's okay.

43
00:01:20,626 --> 00:01:23,626
It's amazing that I got this right.

44
00:01:24,626 --> 00:01:27,626
I'm sure you'll get it right.

45
00:01:27,626 --> 00:01:28,626
I'm sure it's okay.

46
00:01:29,626 --> 00:01:30,626
Hello, Mirei.

47
00:01:30,626 --> 00:01:32,626
Thank you for eating.

48
00:01:32,626 --> 00:01:33,626
I did it.

49
00:01:34,626 --> 00:01:35,626
I'm going to eat this.

50
00:01:35,626 --> 00:01:37,434
I'm going to eat this.

51
00:01:37,434 --> 00:01:38,434
It might be in here

52
00:01:38,434 --> 00:01:39,434
What is it?

53
00:01:39,434 --> 00:01:40,434
It's not in here

54
00:01:40,434 --> 00:01:42,434
I found it!

55
00:01:42,434 --> 00:01:48,634
Start!

56
00:01:48,634 --> 00:01:50,634
I'm in! I'm in! I'm in!

57
00:01:55,002 --> 00:01:56,002
I'm happy, I'm happy

58
00:01:56,002 --> 00:01:58,002
I'm happy, I love steamed bun and
chocolate

59
00:02:01,002 --> 00:02:03,002
We're on air

60
00:02:03,002 --> 00:02:04,002
Well, Aya-chan

61
00:02:04,002 --> 00:02:05,002
Yes

62
00:02:05,002 --> 00:02:07,002
How about this steamed bun?

63
00:02:07,002 --> 00:02:09,002
But, when you put it in your mouth, it's
a little

64
00:02:09,002 --> 00:02:11,002
Ah, like a tamarind

65
00:02:11,002 --> 00:02:13,002
This is a little

66
00:02:14,002 --> 00:02:15,002
This is

67
00:02:15,002 --> 00:02:16,002
Your face is

68
00:02:16,002 --> 00:02:17,002
OK, I've decided

69
00:02:17,002 --> 00:02:19,002
Steamed bun roulette

70
00:02:19,002 --> 00:02:21,002
Steamed bun roulette

71
00:02:22,216 --> 00:02:23,216
I want to eat it

72
00:02:23,216 --> 00:02:24,216
What is that?

73
00:02:25,216 --> 00:02:26,216
I'll eat it

74
00:02:28,216 --> 00:02:29,216
Are you going to poison me?

75
00:02:30,216 --> 00:02:31,216
Are you going to go for a vertical
attack?

76
00:02:35,216 --> 00:02:37,216
I thought my jaw would hurt

77
00:02:37,216 --> 00:02:42,042
To be continued

78
00:02:42,042 --> 00:02:44,042
No?

79
00:02:44,042 --> 00:02:46,042
You did it!

80
00:02:46,042 --> 00:02:48,042
You did it!

81
00:02:48,042 --> 00:02:50,042
Phew!

82
00:02:50,042 --> 00:02:52,042
I feel so good

83
00:02:52,042 --> 00:02:54,042
Ahhhh!

84
00:02:54,042 --> 00:02:56,042
How do you feel?

85
00:02:56,042 --> 00:02:58,042
I feel like a bug is biting me

86
00:02:58,042 --> 00:03:00,042
A bug is biting you?

87
00:03:00,042 --> 00:03:02,042
A bug is biting you?

88
00:03:02,042 --> 00:03:04,042
I feel so good when my teeth and the bug
are overlapping

89
00:03:04,042 --> 00:03:06,042
I feel so good when my teeth and the bug
are overlapping

90
00:03:06,042 --> 00:03:08,042
I did it!

91
00:03:08,042 --> 00:03:10,042
I did it!

92
00:03:10,042 --> 00:03:12,042
We are the third

93
00:03:12,042 --> 00:03:14,042
What should we do?

94
00:03:14,042 --> 00:03:16,042
I don't know

95
00:03:16,042 --> 00:03:18,042
I chose this

96
00:03:18,042 --> 00:03:20,042
What kind of bug do you like?

97
00:03:20,042 --> 00:03:22,042
I like white ones

98
00:03:22,042 --> 00:03:24,042
I like white ones

99
00:03:24,042 --> 00:03:26,042
You mean like a larva?

100
00:03:26,042 --> 00:03:28,042
Yes, larva

101
00:03:28,042 --> 00:03:30,042
I like those that are not mature

102
00:03:30,042 --> 00:03:32,042
I like those that are not mature

103
00:03:32,042 --> 00:03:34,042
How do you feel?

104
00:03:34,042 --> 00:03:36,042
Is it really okay?

105
00:03:36,042 --> 00:03:38,042
I'm not an experienced person

106
00:03:38,042 --> 00:03:40,042
It's okay

107
00:03:40,042 --> 00:03:42,042
Mushipan roulette

108
00:03:42,042 --> 00:03:44,042
Start!

109
00:03:44,042 --> 00:03:47,952
I'm going to start

110
00:03:48,852 --> 00:03:49,852
Oh dear

111
00:03:50,812 --> 00:03:51,812
表情 Alright?

112
00:03:51,952 --> 00:03:53,952
Perfectgram

113
00:03:55,052 --> 00:03:56,072
Go~!

114
00:03:57,792 --> 00:03:59,572
She has promise

115
00:03:59,572 --> 00:04:00,128
Thank you for watching!

116
00:04:00,128 --> 00:04:02,728
Family dance

117
00:04:03,048 --> 00:04:05,088
Let the fourth Walker go

118
00:04:05,448 --> 00:04:06,648
Since he likes bread

119
00:04:07,968 --> 00:04:08,768
How do you do?

120
00:04:09,928 --> 00:04:11,108
You don't look like someone who would be
such an unreliable person

121
00:04:11,888 --> 00:04:13,888
I hope you get the delicious bread

122
00:04:15,888 --> 00:04:17,328
Hello, Walker

123
00:04:17,328 --> 00:04:19,408
I will go home, just go home

124
00:04:21,088 --> 00:04:22,008
Did you sign it?

125
00:04:22,008 --> 00:04:24,108
With such creative力

126
00:04:24,228 --> 00:04:27,028
He grabbed and wrung out the inside

127
00:04:27,028 --> 00:04:27,908
What?

128
00:04:27,908 --> 00:04:28,888
U- cannons

129
00:04:28,888 --> 00:04:31,388
He waved at us

130
00:04:32,328 --> 00:04:36,128
Now go on aрут of the game

131
00:04:36,188 --> 00:04:37,188
Oh!

132
00:04:37,188 --> 00:04:39,188
Good luck!

133
00:04:40,952 --> 00:04:41,952
Is it good?

134
00:04:41,952 --> 00:04:42,952
Is it good?

135
00:04:46,952 --> 00:04:48,952
I was scared just now

136
00:04:52,952 --> 00:04:54,952
Target found

137
00:04:54,952 --> 00:04:55,952
Can we eat bugs?

138
00:04:55,952 --> 00:04:56,952
No?

139
00:04:56,952 --> 00:04:57,952
Not really

140
00:04:57,952 --> 00:05:01,952
I don't think we hate bugs

141
00:05:01,952 --> 00:05:05,952
I don't hate them but I don't like them

142
00:05:05,952 --> 00:05:08,952
Nishipandoretto Start!

143
00:05:10,714 --> 00:05:14,714
I want you to go to the side of the
tree.

144
00:05:14,714 --> 00:05:16,714
You are studying very carefully.

145
00:05:16,714 --> 00:05:18,714
What are you studying?

146
00:05:18,714 --> 00:05:24,208
He sounded like an UFO catching close-
up.

147
00:05:25,208 --> 00:05:26,208
It looks difficult.

148
00:05:26,208 --> 00:05:27,208
It's amazing.

149
00:05:31,208 --> 00:05:33,208
I decided to do this.

150
00:05:33,208 --> 00:05:35,208
How is it? Are you confident?

151
00:05:35,208 --> 00:05:36,208
It's amazing.

152
00:05:38,208 --> 00:05:39,208
Don't lie.

153
00:05:39,208 --> 00:05:40,208
What? I didn't lie.

154
00:05:40,208 --> 00:05:41,208
It's amazing.

155
00:05:41,208 --> 00:05:43,208
Miki-Pandere, start!

156
00:05:47,888 --> 00:05:49,888
I don't know if I can open it

157
00:05:49,888 --> 00:05:51,888
It's not in there

158
00:05:51,888 --> 00:05:53,888
Yay!

159
00:05:53,888 --> 00:05:55,888
It's hard

160
00:05:55,888 --> 00:05:57,888
I forgot how to do it

161
00:06:01,888 --> 00:06:03,888
Hello

162
00:06:03,888 --> 00:06:05,888
The last one is Aiai

163
00:06:05,888 --> 00:06:07,888
I'll open it

164
00:06:07,888 --> 00:06:09,888
I can open it

165
00:06:09,888 --> 00:06:11,888
Aiai, start the Mishpan roulette

166
00:06:11,888 --> 00:06:13,888
Mishpan is good

167
00:06:13,888 --> 00:06:15,888
Mishpan

168
00:06:15,888 --> 00:06:17,888
Oh!

169
00:06:17,888 --> 00:06:19,888
I don't know, it's chocolate

170
00:06:19,888 --> 00:06:21,888
Bye bye

171
00:06:21,888 --> 00:06:23,296
Aiai!

172
00:06:23,296 --> 00:06:26,032
And there's more with a funny trick.

173
00:06:26,312 --> 00:06:26,812
Is it good?

174
00:06:28,712 --> 00:06:29,972
So this one was a jab

175
00:06:32,652 --> 00:06:34,032
What the heck is that?

176
00:06:34,032 --> 00:06:35,392
It's good

177
00:06:37,052 --> 00:06:38,652
But that's not a cow

178
00:06:39,892 --> 00:06:41,352
How was it everyone?

179
00:06:41,432 --> 00:06:43,612
At the end you were able to deal with
the snakespad

180
00:06:45,772 --> 00:06:49,112
The hunger delivered by the snakespad
was no less enough

181
00:06:50,912 --> 00:06:52,252
The game is Winner square

182
00:06:52,252 --> 00:06:54,252
Thank you.

183
00:06:55,616 --> 00:06:58,996
Let's eat eat eat

184
00:06:58,996 --> 00:07:04,636
Let's try our meal as we are quite
interested

185
00:07:04,636 --> 00:07:07,056
Cooking Antonio

186
00:07:07,576 --> 00:07:09,216
3.2.1

187
00:07:10,336 --> 00:07:12,516
Great!

188
00:07:14,136 --> 00:07:16,556
It looks like a deep-fried potato

189
00:07:18,296 --> 00:07:04,516
I'm sure there will be

190
00:07:18,616 --> 00:07:20,796
It's sticky

191
00:07:20,796 --> 00:07:22,796
It's like this is combined with
chocolate

192
00:07:22,796 --> 00:07:23,796
It's good, right?

193
00:07:23,796 --> 00:07:25,796
It's like French fries

194
00:07:26,796 --> 00:07:27,796
It's okay

195
00:07:27,796 --> 00:07:28,796
It's okay?

196
00:07:28,796 --> 00:07:29,796
It's good, right?

197
00:07:29,796 --> 00:07:30,796
Wait a minute

198
00:07:30,796 --> 00:07:31,796
It's okay

199
00:07:31,796 --> 00:07:32,796
It's okay

200
00:07:32,796 --> 00:07:33,796
It's okay

201
00:07:36,796 --> 00:07:37,796
I'll do the same thing again

202
00:07:37,796 --> 00:07:40,224
Please subscribe to my channel!

203
00:07:40,544 --> 00:07:42,544
Oh, it's good!

204
00:07:42,964 --> 00:07:45,624
I didn't have any idea what this was
when I was in parenting.

205
00:07:45,724 --> 00:07:47,964
As soon as I ate my popsicles, I
thought,

206
00:07:48,024 --> 00:07:49,604
... or really if it's really broken....

207
00:07:50,444 --> 00:07:52,244
Ah!

208
00:07:52,244 --> 00:07:59,204
El Ministro

209
00:07:59,578 --> 00:08:02,578
We're in the middle of a debut!

210
00:08:02,578 --> 00:08:07,578
So, let's see the results.

211
00:08:07,578 --> 00:08:09,578
Wow!

212
00:08:09,578 --> 00:08:11,578
What is this?

213
00:08:11,578 --> 00:08:13,578
It's a monster!

214
00:08:13,578 --> 00:08:15,578
There's a monster!

215
00:08:15,578 --> 00:08:17,578
It's popular among young girls.

216
00:08:17,578 --> 00:08:19,578
Wow!

217
00:08:19,578 --> 00:08:21,578
Oh my god!

218
00:08:21,578 --> 00:08:23,578
Who's going first?

219
00:08:23,578 --> 00:08:25,578
Do you want to go first?

220
00:08:25,578 --> 00:08:26,578
No, you go first.

221
00:08:26,578 --> 00:08:27,578
Okay, let's do it.

222
00:08:27,578 --> 00:08:29,578
You're going to take a picture of me?

223
00:08:29,578 --> 00:08:31,578
I think it's better to take a picture
before that.

224
00:08:31,578 --> 00:08:33,578
You're the best!

225
00:08:33,578 --> 00:08:35,578
Thank you.

226
00:08:35,578 --> 00:08:38,578
There are two out of ten.

227
00:08:38,578 --> 00:08:40,578
What?

228
00:08:40,578 --> 00:08:41,578
I love you!

229
00:08:41,578 --> 00:08:43,578
Okay, let's start.

230
00:08:43,578 --> 00:08:45,578
Miss Band U Red!

231
00:08:45,578 --> 00:08:47,578
Good luck!

232
00:08:47,808 --> 00:08:49,108
Good luck!

233
00:08:49,808 --> 00:08:51,808
It's not in the cup.

234
00:08:55,808 --> 00:08:56,808
The second one is Rino's.

235
00:08:56,808 --> 00:08:58,808
I'll put it in the studio.

236
00:08:58,808 --> 00:08:59,808
I'll put it in this.

237
00:08:59,808 --> 00:09:00,808
Let's eat.

238
00:09:00,808 --> 00:09:01,808
Eat it.

239
00:09:05,808 --> 00:09:07,808
It looks delicious.

240
00:09:07,808 --> 00:09:08,808
It's very delicious.

241
00:09:08,808 --> 00:09:09,808
Let's eat.

242
00:09:11,808 --> 00:09:12,808
I don't know.

243
00:09:12,808 --> 00:09:13,808
Is it okay?

244
00:09:14,808 --> 00:09:15,808
I think it's okay.

245
00:09:15,808 --> 00:09:16,808
How is it?

246
00:09:16,808 --> 00:09:17,808
It's elastic.

247
00:09:17,808 --> 00:09:21,808
It's elastic, so I'm wondering if it's
in the cup.

248
00:09:25,512 --> 00:09:26,512
It's there.

249
00:09:27,512 --> 00:09:28,512
It's there.

250
00:09:28,512 --> 00:09:29,512
I'm sorry.

251
00:09:29,512 --> 00:09:32,512
I'm sorry.

252
00:09:32,794 --> 00:09:34,794
I haven't eaten it, but my butt is
getting bigger

253
00:09:34,794 --> 00:09:36,794
No way

254
00:09:36,794 --> 00:09:38,794
I'm so sorry

255
00:09:38,794 --> 00:09:40,794
I'm so sorry

256
00:09:40,794 --> 00:09:42,794
I wonder how big it is

257
00:09:42,794 --> 00:09:44,794
I don't know

258
00:09:44,794 --> 00:09:46,794
What are the experts behind you?

259
00:09:46,794 --> 00:09:48,794
It's like that

260
00:09:48,794 --> 00:09:50,794
Oh, I did it

261
00:09:50,794 --> 00:09:52,794
It's not that good

262
00:09:52,794 --> 00:09:54,794
It's not good. I want to eat it
deliciously

263
00:09:54,794 --> 00:09:56,794
Experts, come back and sit down

264
00:09:56,794 --> 00:09:58,794
Let's go to the next one

265
00:09:58,794 --> 00:10:00,794
I'm sorry

266
00:10:00,794 --> 00:10:02,794
We are in the middle of a wedding

267
00:10:02,794 --> 00:10:04,794
How is the second one?

268
00:10:04,794 --> 00:10:06,794
This one

269
00:10:06,794 --> 00:10:08,794
It looks good

270
00:10:08,794 --> 00:10:10,794
I don't know

271
00:10:10,794 --> 00:10:14,794
Let's start the first one

272
00:10:14,794 --> 00:10:16,794
It's like the last one

273
00:10:16,794 --> 00:10:18,794
My butt is getting bigger

274
00:10:20,794 --> 00:10:22,794
What's going on?

275
00:10:22,794 --> 00:10:24,794
Isn't it different?

276
00:10:24,794 --> 00:10:26,794
It's not in

277
00:10:26,794 --> 00:10:28,794
What's going on?

278
00:10:28,794 --> 00:10:30,794
What's going on?

279
00:10:30,794 --> 00:10:32,794
Please look forward to the next one!

280
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:43,360
Witnessing the design of SNS

281
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:45,232
Thank you!

282
00:10:45,232 --> 00:10:48,232
Which one do you want to choose?

283
00:10:48,232 --> 00:10:49,232
This one!

284
00:10:49,232 --> 00:10:51,232
I think it's a little bit wet

285
00:10:51,232 --> 00:10:53,232
What did you like about it?

286
00:10:53,232 --> 00:10:55,232
It's beautiful square shape

287
00:10:55,232 --> 00:10:56,232
It's beautiful!

288
00:10:56,232 --> 00:10:58,232
Certainly, the way of cutting is
beautiful

289
00:10:58,232 --> 00:11:02,232
If it was cut inside, it would be broken

290
00:11:02,232 --> 00:11:04,232
It's beautiful because it's A-type

291
00:11:04,232 --> 00:11:05,232
Certainly, it's beautiful

292
00:11:05,232 --> 00:11:07,232
It seems that there is also such a snack

293
00:11:07,232 --> 00:11:10,232
Mishipan roulette, start!

294
00:11:10,232 --> 00:11:11,232
I'll eat it!

295
00:11:11,232 --> 00:11:12,232
Hit it!

296
00:11:12,232 --> 00:11:13,232
Hit it!

297
00:11:13,232 --> 00:11:15,232
It's a little bit short

298
00:11:15,232 --> 00:11:16,232
It seems to be all right

299
00:11:18,232 --> 00:11:19,232
Wait a minute!

300
00:11:19,232 --> 00:11:20,232
I can't reach it

301
00:11:21,232 --> 00:11:22,232
The butt?

302
00:11:22,232 --> 00:11:23,232
What?

303
00:11:23,232 --> 00:11:24,232
You said it without saying anything

304
00:11:24,232 --> 00:11:25,232
It hurts!

305
00:11:25,232 --> 00:11:27,232
You said you wanted to turn it

306
00:11:27,232 --> 00:11:28,232
I'll open it right away

307
00:11:28,232 --> 00:11:29,232
I see

308
00:11:29,232 --> 00:11:30,232
It hurts!

309
00:11:30,232 --> 00:11:31,232
It hurts!

310
00:11:31,232 --> 00:11:32,232
It hurts!

311
00:11:32,232 --> 00:11:33,232
It hurts!

312
00:11:33,232 --> 00:11:33,856
It hurts!

313
00:11:34,856 --> 00:11:36,856
I'm glad I didn't fly with this.

314
00:11:38,856 --> 00:11:40,856
I'm scared. Are you OK?

315
00:11:40,856 --> 00:11:42,856
I'm OK. I'm flying normally.

316
00:11:42,856 --> 00:11:44,856
I turned on the switch.

317
00:11:44,856 --> 00:11:45,856
You didn't know?

318
00:11:45,856 --> 00:11:47,856
I'm communicating with someone.

319
00:11:47,856 --> 00:11:49,856
I feel like a ramune.

320
00:11:49,856 --> 00:11:52,856
If I mix it with sweets, I think it's
delicious.

321
00:11:52,856 --> 00:11:54,856
I don't know. It tastes like myunmyeon.

322
00:11:54,856 --> 00:11:59,856
I'm going to myunmyeon.

323
00:12:01,384 --> 00:12:02,384
Hello!

324
00:12:03,384 --> 00:12:04,384
How is it?

325
00:12:04,384 --> 00:12:06,384
I chose one.

326
00:12:06,384 --> 00:12:07,384
Which one?

327
00:12:07,384 --> 00:12:08,384
This one.

328
00:12:08,384 --> 00:12:13,384
You said it was a beautiful shape, so I
wonder if you got the right one.

329
00:12:13,384 --> 00:12:14,384
It's a dance, right?

330
00:12:15,384 --> 00:12:16,384
I'll take this one.

331
00:12:16,384 --> 00:12:17,384
You'll take this one?

332
00:12:17,384 --> 00:12:20,384
Mukbang roulette, start!

333
00:12:20,384 --> 00:12:21,384
Let's eat!

334
00:12:24,688 --> 00:12:25,688
I'm going to hit you

335
00:12:27,688 --> 00:12:28,688
Are you there?

336
00:12:28,688 --> 00:12:29,688
I'm going to hit you

337
00:12:31,688 --> 00:12:33,688
I found you!

338
00:12:36,688 --> 00:12:38,688
Why did you hit me?

339
00:12:39,688 --> 00:12:40,688
Don't you hit me here?

340
00:12:41,688 --> 00:12:42,688
I'll hit you a little bit

341
00:12:44,688 --> 00:12:46,688
I found you, didn't I?

342
00:12:47,688 --> 00:12:48,688
I found you, didn't I?

343
00:12:48,688 --> 00:12:49,688
Oh, no!

344
00:12:50,688 --> 00:12:51,688
Oh, no!

345
00:12:51,688 --> 00:12:52,688
I found you, didn't I?

346
00:12:52,688 --> 00:12:53,688
I found you

347
00:12:53,688 --> 00:12:55,688
Why did you hit me?

348
00:12:57,688 --> 00:12:59,688
I'm not a friend of insects, so I don't
hit you

349
00:13:00,688 --> 00:13:01,688
You'll meet insects soon

350
00:13:01,688 --> 00:13:03,688
I don't like insects

351
00:13:03,688 --> 00:13:05,688
Let's go from this way

352
00:13:05,688 --> 00:13:06,688
I'll hit you from there

353
00:13:10,688 --> 00:13:12,688
Let's open the door and check which way
it is

354
00:13:12,688 --> 00:13:13,688
Let's check

355
00:13:13,688 --> 00:13:15,688
It's better to open the door

356
00:13:15,688 --> 00:13:16,688
I'll hit you

357
00:13:16,688 --> 00:13:17,688
I can imagine

358
00:13:17,688 --> 00:13:20,688
I feel like an angel and a devil are on
your head

359
00:13:20,688 --> 00:13:21,688
That's right

360
00:13:21,688 --> 00:13:22,688
Let's go

361
00:13:22,688 --> 00:13:23,688
Do we break it?

362
00:13:23,688 --> 00:13:26,528
Let's break it

363
00:13:26,528 --> 00:13:29,528
Will it go in?

364
00:13:43,706 --> 00:13:45,706
I'm scared!

365
00:13:45,706 --> 00:13:47,706
Luna!

366
00:13:47,706 --> 00:13:49,706
Bite it!

367
00:13:49,706 --> 00:13:51,706
What?

368
00:13:51,706 --> 00:13:53,706
It's a horror movie!

369
00:13:53,706 --> 00:13:55,706
It's a horror movie!
