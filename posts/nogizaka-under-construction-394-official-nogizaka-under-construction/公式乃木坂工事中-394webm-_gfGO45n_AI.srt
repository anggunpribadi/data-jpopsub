Please select a card.

2
00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:08,080
Thanks for watching.

3
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:13,200
Nogizaka fifty years down the line like.

4
00:00:13,760 --> 00:00:16,320
From now on, up the relatively rockin'
price.

5
00:00:20,920 --> 00:00:22,100
O. A lot of D back...

6
00:00:22,040 --> 00:00:23,940
O XX X XX X X X

7
00:00:23,940 --> 00:00:24,680
X X X X X X

8
00:00:29,880 --> 00:00:30,880
Saikoto!

9
00:00:30,880 --> 00:00:32,240
Saikoto!

10
00:00:32,240 --> 00:00:35,960
We will be doing the video quiz Bro
minus

11
00:00:35,960 --> 00:00:39,200
talking here, with some entertainment

12
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:41,392
coming up soon as well

13
00:00:42,392 --> 00:00:48,392
Last year, Nobizaka46 brought a lot of
news to the world

14
00:00:48,392 --> 00:00:55,392
We will introduce the small news of the
members

15
00:00:57,592 --> 00:01:01,592
Tonight's news is from July 8th, 2022

16
00:01:03,592 --> 00:01:05,592
Kuromi's senpai wind is getting stronger

17
00:01:06,592 --> 00:01:09,592
Yoda is looking at his relationship with
his senpai

18
00:01:11,592 --> 00:01:13,592
Yakubo's eyebrows disappear due to the
rhyme

19
00:01:14,592 --> 00:01:17,592
Ioki rediscovered the charm of fighting

20
00:01:18,592 --> 00:01:21,592
Akimoto received a gift of a joke every
day

21
00:01:21,592 --> 00:01:25,592
That's all for July 8th B-class news

22
00:01:28,592 --> 00:01:31,592
I didn't know until I heard the story

23
00:01:32,592 --> 00:01:35,592
Kuromi's senpai wind is getting stronger

24
00:01:36,592 --> 00:01:39,592
Kuromi's senpai wind is getting stronger

25
00:01:41,592 --> 00:01:43,592
This is me

26
00:01:44,592 --> 00:01:45,592
I was imitating you

27
00:01:46,592 --> 00:01:48,592
I was imitating you

28
00:01:48,592 --> 00:01:49,592
I was imitating you

29
00:01:50,592 --> 00:01:54,592
The first time I thought Kuromi's senpai
wind was getting stronger

30
00:01:55,592 --> 00:01:57,592
was at the Under Live in March

31
00:01:58,592 --> 00:02:01,592
I was imitating Maaya-san

32
00:02:02,592 --> 00:02:03,592
I was imitating her

33
00:02:04,592 --> 00:02:08,592
When we were in a line, I was doing this
to her

34
00:02:09,592 --> 00:02:10,592
I was like, are you OK?

35
00:02:11,592 --> 00:02:12,592
I was like, are you OK?

36
00:02:13,592 --> 00:02:15,592
I was doing this to a nervous junior

37
00:02:15,592 --> 00:02:18,592
I see. This is not a time-travel

38
00:02:19,592 --> 00:02:22,592
After that, a student came in

39
00:02:23,592 --> 00:02:27,592
The school was close to the Nissan
Stadium

40
00:02:28,592 --> 00:02:29,592
The students and Kuromi were talking

41
00:02:30,592 --> 00:02:32,592
There was a Kuromi Field in the hallway

42
00:02:33,592 --> 00:02:34,592
Kuromi Field?

43
00:02:35,592 --> 00:02:36,592
It was like a Kuromi Town

44
00:02:37,592 --> 00:02:39,592
They were talking from this angle

45
00:02:40,592 --> 00:02:42,592
It was like zero distance

46
00:02:42,592 --> 00:02:44,592
Zero distance? That's amazing

47
00:02:45,592 --> 00:02:50,592
The student was not doing a public
service

48
00:02:51,592 --> 00:02:55,592
When I heard Kuromi's voice, I felt like
I had to go to the prison

49
00:02:56,592 --> 00:03:00,592
The student was told like this

50
00:03:01,592 --> 00:03:04,592
At first, I was happy that she came

51
00:03:05,592 --> 00:03:06,592
I think Kuromi is great

52
00:03:06,592 --> 00:03:12,592
When two people gather, everyone goes to
the Kuromi Field

53
00:03:13,592 --> 00:03:14,592
That's Kuromi Field

54
00:03:15,592 --> 00:03:17,592
Look, there is no picture of Kuromi
Field

55
00:03:18,592 --> 00:03:19,592
I didn't take it

56
00:03:20,592 --> 00:03:21,592
I want you to take it in the future

57
00:03:22,592 --> 00:03:23,592
It will be held regularly, so I will
definitely take it

58
00:03:24,592 --> 00:03:25,592
I want to do it

59
00:03:26,592 --> 00:03:27,592
What did Kuromi-senpai talk about?

60
00:03:28,592 --> 00:03:29,592
She reported her nervousness

61
00:03:30,592 --> 00:03:31,592
Report her nervousness?

62
00:03:32,592 --> 00:03:33,592
She went out to the hallway?

63
00:03:33,592 --> 00:03:36,592
Kuromi-san was like, how are you?

64
00:03:37,592 --> 00:03:39,592
How are you?

65
00:03:40,592 --> 00:03:42,592
She said, I'm good

66
00:03:43,592 --> 00:03:44,592
What is good?

67
00:03:45,592 --> 00:03:48,592
Thank you for helping me with my work

68
00:03:49,592 --> 00:03:52,592
No problem. I have a picture of my
student ID

69
00:03:53,592 --> 00:03:54,592
That's not good

70
00:03:55,592 --> 00:03:56,592
Did you see it?

71
00:03:57,592 --> 00:03:58,592
Did you see it?

72
00:03:59,592 --> 00:04:00,538
I saw it

73
00:04:00,538 --> 00:04:01,538
I see.

74
00:04:01,538 --> 00:04:05,538
I think she should join a different idol
group.

75
00:04:05,538 --> 00:04:08,538
She should stop her.

76
00:04:08,538 --> 00:04:09,538
Interesting.

77
00:04:09,538 --> 00:04:10,538
Next.

78
00:04:10,538 --> 00:04:12,538
Yoda.

79
00:04:12,538 --> 00:04:14,538
Why do you care about relationships?

80
00:04:14,538 --> 00:04:15,538
It's heavy.

81
00:04:15,538 --> 00:04:19,538
I want to get along with everyone
regardless of seniority or juniority in
2022.

82
00:04:19,538 --> 00:04:20,538
You are a black-eyed girl.

83
00:04:20,538 --> 00:04:21,538
Black-eyed girl.

84
00:04:21,538 --> 00:04:22,538
You admire her.

85
00:04:22,538 --> 00:04:23,538
I admire her.

86
00:04:23,538 --> 00:04:24,538
Yoda's admiration.

87
00:04:24,538 --> 00:04:27,538
Black-eyed girl already did it.

88
00:04:27,538 --> 00:04:30,538
I thought so.

89
00:04:30,538 --> 00:04:33,538
But I was alone on my day off.

90
00:04:33,538 --> 00:04:35,538
I was talking to the TV.

91
00:04:35,538 --> 00:04:38,538
I thought I couldn't achieve it.

92
00:04:38,538 --> 00:04:40,538
So, I invited my juniors.

93
00:04:40,538 --> 00:04:43,538
You look forward to it.

94
00:04:43,538 --> 00:04:44,538
Who did you invite?

95
00:04:44,538 --> 00:04:46,538
YUNA SHIBATA.

96
00:04:46,538 --> 00:04:49,538
I invited Rika and KAKKI.

97
00:04:49,538 --> 00:04:52,538
I also invited her to her house.

98
00:04:52,538 --> 00:04:56,538
I'm going to get along with her.

99
00:04:56,538 --> 00:04:59,538
You are all in a relationship.

100
00:04:59,538 --> 00:05:00,538
You should get along with her.

101
00:05:00,538 --> 00:05:03,538
Don't you invite UME?

102
00:05:03,538 --> 00:05:05,538
I'm not confident.

103
00:05:05,538 --> 00:05:07,538
I can't invite her.

104
00:05:07,538 --> 00:05:12,538
There was a member who could invite her.

105
00:05:12,538 --> 00:05:14,538
I want to invite her.

106
00:05:14,538 --> 00:05:16,538
You are a black-eyed girl.

107
00:05:16,538 --> 00:05:18,538
She will definitely invite you.

108
00:05:18,538 --> 00:05:20,538
Please invite me.

109
00:05:20,538 --> 00:05:22,538
You should invite her.

110
00:05:22,538 --> 00:05:23,538
You should book her with someone.

111
00:05:23,538 --> 00:05:24,538
She won't come.

112
00:05:24,538 --> 00:05:27,538
Why?

113
00:05:27,538 --> 00:05:30,538
You can't invite her.

114
00:05:30,538 --> 00:05:35,538
I often don't go beyond the invitation.

115
00:05:35,538 --> 00:05:40,538
I'm worried that she doesn't want to go
with me.

116
00:05:40,538 --> 00:05:44,538
But I want to invite her.

117
00:05:44,538 --> 00:05:47,538
What happens without her?

118
00:05:47,538 --> 00:05:49,538
This is interesting.

119
00:05:49,538 --> 00:05:51,538
Next is this.

120
00:05:51,538 --> 00:05:54,538
This is a picture of Jingu.

121
00:05:54,538 --> 00:05:56,538
This is a picture of the day I came to
see her.

122
00:05:56,538 --> 00:05:59,538
I drew this picture on the day I came to
see her.

123
00:05:59,538 --> 00:06:03,538
You look like a mother.

124
00:06:03,538 --> 00:06:05,538
I like that.

125
00:06:05,538 --> 00:06:07,538
You look like a mother.

126
00:06:07,538 --> 00:06:09,538
Is there a video?

127
00:06:09,538 --> 00:06:11,538
I want to see it.

128
00:06:15,538 --> 00:06:18,538
You look like an adult.

129
00:06:18,538 --> 00:06:21,538
You look cool.

130
00:06:21,538 --> 00:06:23,538
You look good.

131
00:06:23,538 --> 00:06:25,538
You look good.

132
00:06:25,538 --> 00:06:26,538
You look beautiful.

133
00:06:26,538 --> 00:06:29,538
You look like a child.

134
00:06:29,538 --> 00:06:31,538
You look like an adult.

135
00:06:31,538 --> 00:06:33,538
Is this okay?

136
00:06:33,538 --> 00:06:35,538
You can draw this picture.

137
00:06:35,538 --> 00:06:39,538
Is this okay?

138
00:06:39,538 --> 00:06:42,538
Thank you.

139
00:06:42,538 --> 00:06:45,538
Next is IYOKI.

140
00:06:45,538 --> 00:06:48,538
Is this a bath?

141
00:06:48,538 --> 00:06:55,538
I took my friends to a small bath on my
way home from school.

142
00:06:55,538 --> 00:06:57,538
That's good.

143
00:06:57,538 --> 00:06:59,538
I liked that.

144
00:06:59,538 --> 00:07:04,538
I didn't know that after I came to this
place.

145
00:07:04,538 --> 00:07:09,538
I spend a lot of time alone.

146
00:07:09,538 --> 00:07:12,538
You have a good hobby.

147
00:07:12,538 --> 00:07:16,538
I drink milk from a bottle when I'm
done.

148
00:07:16,538 --> 00:07:19,538
You are happy.

149
00:07:19,538 --> 00:07:21,538
You are cute.

150
00:07:21,538 --> 00:07:24,538
Is this true?

151
00:07:24,538 --> 00:07:28,538
Is this a real GACHAPIN?

152
00:07:28,538 --> 00:07:31,538
There is green.

153
00:07:31,538 --> 00:07:33,538
You are cute.

154
00:07:33,538 --> 00:07:35,538
This is a picture of a bath.

155
00:07:35,538 --> 00:07:38,538
This is a picture of a bare face.

156
00:07:38,538 --> 00:07:40,538
This is amazing.

157
00:07:40,538 --> 00:07:43,538
This time I have a real picture.

158
00:07:43,538 --> 00:07:45,538
This is amazing.

159
00:07:45,538 --> 00:07:47,538
Let's continue.

160
00:07:47,538 --> 00:07:48,538
This is scary.

161
00:07:48,538 --> 00:07:50,538
You send a gag every day.

162
00:07:50,538 --> 00:07:56,538
I was with Hayashi every day.

163
00:07:56,538 --> 00:07:59,538
I was able to make a gag every time I
met him.

164
00:07:59,538 --> 00:08:02,538
Hayashi is a gagger.

165
00:08:02,538 --> 00:08:05,538
I give him a gag.

166
00:08:05,538 --> 00:08:07,538
I give him a present.

167
00:08:07,538 --> 00:08:10,538
I have never used it.

168
00:08:10,538 --> 00:08:12,538
I want you to show me.

169
00:08:12,538 --> 00:08:15,538
Can I show you what I got?

170
00:08:15,538 --> 00:08:17,538
I got it, so I'll show you.

171
00:08:17,538 --> 00:08:19,538
I will show you Hayashi's gag.

172
00:08:19,538 --> 00:08:20,538
Please show me.

173
00:08:20,538 --> 00:08:22,538
This is a piece.

174
00:08:22,538 --> 00:08:24,538
What did you say?

175
00:08:24,538 --> 00:08:26,538
I didn't use it.

176
00:08:26,538 --> 00:08:28,538
This is a piece.

177
00:08:28,538 --> 00:08:30,538
I showed him a piece of my teeth.

178
00:08:30,538 --> 00:08:33,538
I gave him a piece.

179
00:08:33,538 --> 00:08:35,538
I don't know what it is.

180
00:08:35,538 --> 00:08:37,538
People who make a gag are like that.

181
00:08:37,538 --> 00:08:39,538
I can be recognized someday.

182
00:08:39,538 --> 00:08:43,538
I can be recognized someday or I can't
be recognized someday.

183
00:08:43,538 --> 00:08:46,538
Do you have a gag that you named
yourself?

184
00:08:46,538 --> 00:08:47,538
I haven't made it yet.

185
00:08:47,538 --> 00:08:51,538
Since the summer ended, I started
imitating KUROMI.

186
00:08:53,538 --> 00:08:56,538
I changed my name.

187
00:08:56,538 --> 00:09:00,538
I want you to make a gag that you can
introduce yourself.

188
00:09:00,538 --> 00:09:02,538
That's good.

189
00:09:02,538 --> 00:09:05,538
Do you have a gag that you can introduce
yourself?

190
00:09:05,538 --> 00:09:07,538
I will introduce myself as Hayashinso.

191
00:09:09,538 --> 00:09:11,538
Please do it.

192
00:09:11,538 --> 00:09:13,538
I will introduce myself as Hayashinso.

193
00:09:13,538 --> 00:09:15,538
That's good.

194
00:09:15,538 --> 00:09:16,538
I will use it.

195
00:09:16,538 --> 00:09:19,538
Hayashi is Hayashinoki.

196
00:09:19,538 --> 00:09:21,538
Hayashinoki is good.

197
00:09:21,538 --> 00:09:23,538
How about Hayashinoki?

198
00:09:23,538 --> 00:09:25,538
Hayashinoki.

199
00:09:25,538 --> 00:09:27,538
Hayashinoki is cuter.

200
00:09:27,538 --> 00:09:30,538
Hayashinoki should be a little like a
palm tree.

201
00:09:30,538 --> 00:09:32,538
I see.

202
00:09:32,538 --> 00:09:34,538
Hayashinoki.

203
00:09:34,538 --> 00:09:35,538
Hayashinoki.

204
00:09:35,538 --> 00:09:37,538
Hayashinoki is like a palm tree.

205
00:09:37,538 --> 00:09:39,538
That's KUROMI.

206
00:09:39,538 --> 00:09:41,538
That's KUROMI.

207
00:09:41,538 --> 00:09:44,538
That's KUROMI.

208
00:09:44,538 --> 00:09:47,538
Please show me KUROMI's palm tree.

209
00:09:47,538 --> 00:09:48,538
I will show you.

210
00:09:48,538 --> 00:09:50,538
KUROMI's palm tree.

211
00:09:50,538 --> 00:09:53,538
That's a selfish thing.

212
00:09:53,538 --> 00:09:57,538
What are you doing?

213
00:09:57,538 --> 00:10:00,538
I was thinking about it.

214
00:10:00,538 --> 00:10:02,538
I made it my own.

215
00:10:02,538 --> 00:10:05,538
I want to make it my own this year.

216
00:10:05,538 --> 00:10:08,538
Don't put your hand above your head.

217
00:10:08,538 --> 00:10:10,538
Why are you giving me a lesson?

218
00:10:10,538 --> 00:10:14,208
This is for you.

219
00:10:14,208 --> 00:10:18,208
From here, we'll be covering Nobizaka
B-class news from September.

220
00:10:19,392 --> 00:10:23,392
Sakaguchi, this year also forgotten.

221
00:10:23,392 --> 00:10:27,392
Endo, the love that was left behind
becomes the main.

222
00:10:28,392 --> 00:10:31,392
Kaki, a message from Kamakiri.

223
00:10:32,392 --> 00:10:35,392
Yumiki, the joints of her grandmother
are beautiful.

224
00:10:36,392 --> 00:10:39,392
Hayashi, success in the Miiraka of
Mikan.

225
00:10:40,392 --> 00:10:43,392
Yakumo, eating churros in the toilet.

226
00:10:43,392 --> 00:10:49,392
This was the Nogizaka B-class news of
2022.

227
00:11:14,392 --> 00:11:16,392
I also forgot this year.

228
00:11:16,392 --> 00:11:21,392
Yamashita posted a group photo of the
3rd generation of blog.

229
00:11:23,392 --> 00:11:25,392
I was there.

230
00:11:25,392 --> 00:11:30,392
Yamashita posted a photo of me alone.

231
00:11:31,392 --> 00:11:33,392
Is that true?

232
00:11:34,392 --> 00:11:35,392
This is there.

233
00:11:35,392 --> 00:11:37,392
Is Sakaguchi there?

234
00:11:37,392 --> 00:11:38,392
Yes.

235
00:11:38,392 --> 00:11:40,392
Where is Sakaguchi?

236
00:11:40,392 --> 00:11:44,392
It's between Yoda and Renka.

237
00:11:44,392 --> 00:11:47,392
There is a blog again.

238
00:11:47,392 --> 00:11:49,392
This is now.

239
00:11:49,392 --> 00:11:52,392
The back of the photo is cut.

240
00:11:53,392 --> 00:11:55,392
Why?

241
00:11:55,392 --> 00:11:57,392
You can just go forward.

242
00:11:58,392 --> 00:12:01,392
I take this photo when the 3rd
generation of blog is gathered.

243
00:12:01,392 --> 00:12:05,392
I think this is forgotten by me.

244
00:12:05,392 --> 00:12:07,392
I take a picture again.

245
00:12:07,392 --> 00:12:11,392
I take a lot of pictures because someone
is in the middle.

246
00:12:11,392 --> 00:12:13,392
But this is gone.

247
00:12:13,392 --> 00:12:16,392
This is gone even when I'm practicing.

248
00:12:16,392 --> 00:12:18,392
Everyone may not have noticed.

249
00:12:18,392 --> 00:12:20,392
Show me again.

250
00:12:20,392 --> 00:12:22,392
This is gone.

251
00:12:25,392 --> 00:12:27,392
This is moving.

252
00:12:27,392 --> 00:12:29,392
This is like a psychological photo.

253
00:12:29,392 --> 00:12:31,392
This is fast.

254
00:12:31,392 --> 00:12:34,392
Can you move like that during practice?

255
00:12:34,392 --> 00:12:37,392
This is moving backwards.

256
00:12:40,392 --> 00:12:43,392
You can put this in UME.

257
00:12:43,392 --> 00:12:46,392
You can put this here.

258
00:12:46,392 --> 00:12:48,392
I'm not a person.

259
00:12:49,392 --> 00:12:50,392
Call UME.

260
00:12:50,392 --> 00:12:53,392
I will bring it to the first place.

261
00:12:53,392 --> 00:12:56,392
Next is N.

262
00:12:56,392 --> 00:12:58,392
Is this also a Yakubo?

263
00:12:58,392 --> 00:12:59,392
That's right.

264
00:12:59,392 --> 00:13:00,392
What is it?

265
00:13:00,392 --> 00:13:02,392
This is a story of YAKUBO MIYA.

266
00:13:02,392 --> 00:13:08,392
I started to get jealous of him after
two days.

267
00:13:08,392 --> 00:13:12,392
You don't just say you like him.

268
00:13:12,392 --> 00:13:18,392
I started to talk to RUNA HAYASHI.

269
00:13:18,392 --> 00:13:22,392
I said I like him more.

270
00:13:22,392 --> 00:13:24,392
You are cheating.

271
00:13:24,392 --> 00:13:25,392
I'm not cheating.

272
00:13:25,392 --> 00:13:27,392
I'm just talking.

273
00:13:27,392 --> 00:13:28,392
I will be hated.

274
00:13:28,392 --> 00:13:33,392
He calls me by a special nickname.

275
00:13:33,392 --> 00:13:38,392
I started to call him RURURU.

276
00:13:38,392 --> 00:13:41,392
From now on, call me YASHINOKI.

277
00:13:45,392 --> 00:13:48,392
RURURU is stronger.

278
00:13:48,392 --> 00:13:50,392
I like it.

279
00:13:50,392 --> 00:13:52,392
I want more.

280
00:13:52,392 --> 00:13:55,392
I like SAKU.

281
00:13:55,392 --> 00:13:59,392
You should get along with other people.

282
00:13:59,392 --> 00:14:01,392
I'm glad you like me.

283
00:14:01,392 --> 00:14:04,392
If you block this, you will be alone.

284
00:14:04,392 --> 00:14:07,392
I want you to have a sense of decency.

285
00:14:08,392 --> 00:14:10,392
You can talk to RUNA HAYASHI.

286
00:14:10,392 --> 00:14:14,392
I'm being called a big name.

287
00:14:14,392 --> 00:14:16,392
Is it a big name?

288
00:14:16,392 --> 00:14:18,392
The title is a big name.

289
00:14:18,392 --> 00:14:20,392
I may be hated.

290
00:14:20,392 --> 00:14:21,392
Do you hate me?

291
00:14:21,392 --> 00:14:24,392
I don't hate you.

292
00:14:24,392 --> 00:14:26,392
I can't say that.

293
00:14:26,392 --> 00:14:28,392
You can say it.

294
00:14:29,392 --> 00:14:31,392
I'm scared.

295
00:14:31,392 --> 00:14:32,392
I don't know what to do.

296
00:14:32,392 --> 00:14:35,392
Everyone likes SAKU.

297
00:14:35,392 --> 00:14:38,392
You get along with SAKU.

298
00:14:38,392 --> 00:14:40,392
I want to get along with SAKU.

299
00:14:40,392 --> 00:14:42,392
It's good to get along with SAKU.

300
00:14:42,392 --> 00:14:44,392
I don't like it.

301
00:14:44,392 --> 00:14:46,392
The distance between you and SAKU is the
same as me.

302
00:14:48,392 --> 00:14:52,392
The distance between you and SAKU is the
same as me.

303
00:14:52,392 --> 00:14:54,392
I'm the best.

304
00:14:54,392 --> 00:14:59,856
Let's ask SAKU.

305
00:14:59,856 --> 00:15:04,316
Which is the closest to you?

306
00:15:04,316 --> 00:15:06,316
No, no, no.

307
00:15:06,316 --> 00:15:08,316
Please give me a rating.

308
00:15:08,316 --> 00:15:10,316
Who do you think is the closest?

309
00:15:10,316 --> 00:15:12,316
distance

310
00:15:12,316 --> 00:15:14,316
The distance between you and yourself.

311
00:15:14,316 --> 00:15:18,316
SAKU, I've been with you for a long
time.

312
00:15:18,316 --> 00:15:20,316
I've been saying that.

313
00:15:20,316 --> 00:15:22,316
It's Hayashi.

314
00:15:22,316 --> 00:15:24,316
From this feeling, it's YAKUBO.

315
00:15:24,316 --> 00:15:26,316
YAKUBO's love is not enough.

316
00:15:26,316 --> 00:15:28,316
Me?

317
00:15:28,316 --> 00:15:30,316
You're so cute.

318
00:15:30,316 --> 00:15:32,316
You said you liked me so much.

319
00:15:32,316 --> 00:15:34,316
You're making me so lost.

320
00:15:34,316 --> 00:15:36,316
Your love is not enough.

321
00:15:36,316 --> 00:15:38,316
I'm sorry.

322
00:15:38,316 --> 00:15:40,316
I'm not looking for love that you like.

323
00:15:40,316 --> 00:15:42,316
What are you doing?

324
00:15:42,316 --> 00:15:44,316
I don't even have eyebrows.

325
00:15:44,316 --> 00:15:46,316
That's what it is.

326
00:15:46,316 --> 00:15:48,316
That's what it is.

327
00:15:48,316 --> 00:15:52,316
Show me your gag.

328
00:15:53,864 --> 00:15:55,864
No, not that.

329
00:15:56,864 --> 00:15:58,864
Why is it a tease?

330
00:15:58,864 --> 00:16:00,864
Throw away the tease!

331
00:16:01,864 --> 00:16:03,864
That was a beautiful flow!

332
00:16:03,864 --> 00:16:05,864
Why is it a tease?

333
00:16:06,864 --> 00:16:08,864
I'm going to make you like it.

334
00:16:08,864 --> 00:16:11,864
You know the story of Kitakaze and the
sun, right?

335
00:16:11,864 --> 00:16:15,864
Kitakaze comes because he's cold when he
tries to take off his clothes in the
wind.

336
00:16:15,864 --> 00:16:18,864
I'll take it off with the power of the
warm sun.

337
00:16:18,864 --> 00:16:19,864
It's the sun, right?

338
00:16:19,864 --> 00:16:20,864
Saki-chan.

339
00:16:20,864 --> 00:16:22,864
You're wrong.

340
00:16:22,864 --> 00:16:25,864
You don't know the story of Kitakaze and
the sun, do you?

341
00:16:25,864 --> 00:16:27,864
You didn't change anything.

342
00:16:28,864 --> 00:16:30,864
So, please do it like that.

343
00:16:31,864 --> 00:16:32,864
Next.

344
00:16:32,864 --> 00:16:34,864
This is it.

345
00:16:34,864 --> 00:16:35,864
It's a little bit.

346
00:16:35,864 --> 00:16:37,864
What is this?

347
00:16:37,864 --> 00:16:38,864
Is there such a flow?

348
00:16:38,864 --> 00:16:41,864
But it's not like we've put together a
flow like this.

349
00:16:41,864 --> 00:16:42,864
Of course.

350
00:16:45,864 --> 00:16:48,864
I wanted you to see this message.

351
00:16:48,864 --> 00:16:50,864
What is it?

352
00:16:51,864 --> 00:16:53,864
Good luck, Saki-chan.

353
00:16:55,864 --> 00:16:56,864
It's a black eye.

354
00:16:57,864 --> 00:16:58,864
It's a black eye.

355
00:16:58,864 --> 00:17:00,864
It's just a black eye.

356
00:17:01,864 --> 00:17:02,864
It's a black eye from the side.

357
00:17:02,864 --> 00:17:03,864
Really.

358
00:17:03,864 --> 00:17:05,864
Every year, I see it on B-class news.

359
00:17:05,864 --> 00:17:06,864
That girl.

360
00:17:06,864 --> 00:17:07,864
Itoko-chan.

361
00:17:07,864 --> 00:17:08,864
She's cute.

362
00:17:08,864 --> 00:17:09,864
Miki.

363
00:17:09,864 --> 00:17:11,864
She came to see me at Kamakiri.

364
00:17:11,864 --> 00:17:13,864
I don't know why, but Kamakiri.

365
00:17:13,864 --> 00:17:15,864
I was expecting this flow.

366
00:17:15,864 --> 00:17:17,864
I can't think of anything but that.

367
00:17:17,864 --> 00:17:21,864
So, there's Kamakiri, but there's
Kamakiri next to it.

368
00:17:23,864 --> 00:17:25,864
It means, good luck.

369
00:17:25,864 --> 00:17:27,864
Let's move on.

370
00:17:27,864 --> 00:17:28,864
Yumiki.

371
00:17:28,864 --> 00:17:29,864
What is this?

372
00:17:29,864 --> 00:17:30,864
The joints are beautiful.

373
00:17:30,864 --> 00:17:31,864
The joints of the old lady.

374
00:17:31,864 --> 00:17:32,864
That's right.

375
00:17:32,864 --> 00:17:35,864
My grandmother was in her 70s or 80s.

376
00:17:35,864 --> 00:17:37,864
I didn't know that.

377
00:17:37,864 --> 00:17:39,864
That's a witch.

378
00:17:40,864 --> 00:17:45,864
The knees and elbows of this old lady
are very beautiful.

379
00:17:45,864 --> 00:17:47,864
I want you to see it.

380
00:17:48,864 --> 00:17:49,864
It's beautiful.

381
00:17:49,864 --> 00:17:51,864
It's shiny.

382
00:17:51,864 --> 00:17:52,864
That's amazing.

383
00:17:52,864 --> 00:17:53,864
It's shiny.

384
00:17:53,864 --> 00:17:55,864
The knees are beautiful.

385
00:17:55,864 --> 00:17:56,864
Where is this?

386
00:17:56,864 --> 00:17:57,864
This is the knee.

387
00:17:57,864 --> 00:17:58,864
Is this a knee?

388
00:17:58,864 --> 00:17:59,864
I don't know.

389
00:17:59,864 --> 00:18:00,864
I don't know where it is.

390
00:18:00,864 --> 00:18:02,864
Did you ask about the knee?

391
00:18:02,864 --> 00:18:03,864
It's very beautiful.

392
00:18:03,864 --> 00:18:05,864
There is a secret.

393
00:18:05,864 --> 00:18:06,864
The elbow and knee?

394
00:18:06,864 --> 00:18:11,864
It's a secret that you never touch your
elbow or knee.

395
00:18:11,864 --> 00:18:15,864
The elbow and knee are beautiful because
they were raised.

396
00:18:15,864 --> 00:18:18,864
It's like an oil.

397
00:18:19,864 --> 00:18:24,864
Is the old lady's elbow and knee
beautiful?

398
00:18:24,864 --> 00:18:26,864
My elbow is black.

399
00:18:26,864 --> 00:18:28,864
It's not black at all.

400
00:18:28,864 --> 00:18:30,864
My knees are black.

401
00:18:30,864 --> 00:18:32,864
It's erotic to show your knees.

402
00:18:32,864 --> 00:18:33,864
You don't have to show it.

403
00:18:33,864 --> 00:18:34,864
I can show it.

404
00:18:34,864 --> 00:18:35,864
Is that true?

405
00:18:36,864 --> 00:18:38,864
Your knees are not black.

406
00:18:38,864 --> 00:18:39,864
Is your elbow okay?

407
00:18:39,864 --> 00:18:41,864
It's beautiful.

408
00:18:41,864 --> 00:18:42,864
It's beautiful.

409
00:18:42,864 --> 00:18:44,864
It's beautiful.

410
00:18:44,864 --> 00:18:46,864
I was embarrassed.

411
00:18:46,864 --> 00:18:48,864
You are naked.

412
00:18:50,864 --> 00:18:53,864
Your knees will be beautiful in the
future.

413
00:18:53,864 --> 00:18:57,864
I want to participate in the knee one
grand prix.

414
00:18:57,864 --> 00:19:00,864
You don't want to participate in the
knee one grand prix.

415
00:19:00,864 --> 00:19:01,864
I see.

416
00:19:01,864 --> 00:19:04,384
Thank you for watching this video.

417
00:19:05,384 --> 00:19:07,384
What is this?

418
00:19:07,384 --> 00:19:09,384
Is this a Mikan flower?

419
00:19:09,384 --> 00:19:15,384
On Valentine's Day, Higuchi-san gave us
a Mikan flower.

420
00:19:15,384 --> 00:19:19,384
I drew a picture of the name and the
face of the person.

421
00:19:19,384 --> 00:19:23,384
I saw it at the end of the event.

422
00:19:23,384 --> 00:19:29,384
I drew a picture of the person and gave
it to you.

423
00:19:29,384 --> 00:19:38,384
I thought the picture would be cut off,
so I decided not to eat it.

424
00:19:38,384 --> 00:19:43,384
I dried it while adjusting the air
conditioner.

425
00:19:43,384 --> 00:19:46,384
This is like a dry flower.

426
00:19:48,384 --> 00:19:51,384
This picture is still there.

427
00:19:51,384 --> 00:19:53,384
This is still there.

428
00:19:53,384 --> 00:19:58,384
This picture is dirty.

429
00:20:00,152 --> 00:20:00,912
This is hard.

430
00:20:00,912 --> 00:20:01,792
This is hard.

431
00:20:01,792 --> 00:20:03,512
This is zero moisture.

432
00:20:03,512 --> 00:20:05,992
This melts the hardness.

433
00:20:05,992 --> 00:20:08,192
Did you give HIGUCHI that much?

434
00:20:08,192 --> 00:20:08,952
I took good care of it.

435
00:20:08,952 --> 00:20:11,152
Did you give HIGUCHI chocolate?

436
00:20:11,152 --> 00:20:12,152
I didn't give it to him.

437
00:20:12,152 --> 00:20:14,952
He only gave me one.

438
00:20:14,952 --> 00:20:15,952
Hey.

439
00:20:15,952 --> 00:20:17,432
I'm just happy.

440
00:20:17,432 --> 00:20:20,952
Did anyone drink the juice that you
bought?

441
00:20:20,952 --> 00:20:22,992
I bought it.

442
00:20:22,992 --> 00:20:24,472
This is amazing.

443
00:20:24,472 --> 00:20:26,192
This is like a drug store.

444
00:20:26,192 --> 00:20:28,352
Is this a collector?

445
00:20:28,352 --> 00:20:30,832
I bought a refrigerator recently.

446
00:20:30,832 --> 00:20:35,032
I also moved SHINUCHI's tea.

447
00:20:35,032 --> 00:20:37,552
You are a person who can't throw away
things.

448
00:20:37,552 --> 00:20:40,032
I can't throw it away or drink it.

449
00:20:40,032 --> 00:20:42,672
Where do you usually put it?

450
00:20:42,672 --> 00:20:44,592
I put it next to my shoe box.

451
00:20:44,592 --> 00:20:48,312
I put it next to my shoe box when I go
out of the house every day.

452
00:20:48,312 --> 00:20:51,192
I don't know you, but I think you are
dirty.

453
00:20:51,192 --> 00:20:53,672
You still have it in your case.

454
00:20:53,672 --> 00:20:55,752
Next.

455
00:20:55,752 --> 00:20:57,872
What is this?

456
00:20:57,872 --> 00:21:00,112
I am a sophomore in college.

457
00:21:00,112 --> 00:21:02,952
I took remote classes for a year.

458
00:21:02,952 --> 00:21:04,912
I don't have many friends.

459
00:21:04,912 --> 00:21:08,392
You are a college student and you are
doing this kind of work.

460
00:21:08,392 --> 00:21:11,792
I don't have many friends because it's
hard to make.

461
00:21:11,792 --> 00:21:15,072
I really want to eat CHURROS at college.

462
00:21:15,072 --> 00:21:18,672
I sell CHURROS in the kitchen car.

463
00:21:18,672 --> 00:21:25,352
I'm a little embarrassed to eat bright
food alone.

464
00:21:25,352 --> 00:21:30,112
CHURROS is a very Western food.

465
00:21:30,112 --> 00:21:32,152
I really wanted to eat CHURROS.

466
00:21:32,152 --> 00:21:34,872
I bought CHURROS and hid it in my
jacket.

467
00:21:34,872 --> 00:21:39,232
I ran to the toilet and ate CHURROS
alone.

468
00:21:39,232 --> 00:21:42,392
You are a pitiful story.

469
00:21:42,392 --> 00:21:44,592
I have a picture.

470
00:21:44,592 --> 00:21:45,592
Is this a toilet?

471
00:21:45,592 --> 00:21:46,552
This is a toilet.

472
00:21:46,552 --> 00:21:49,112
I don't understand.

473
00:21:49,112 --> 00:21:55,432
You should have said that you would eat
CHURROS with a stranger.

474
00:21:55,432 --> 00:21:59,152
I can't do things like CHURROS.

475
00:21:59,152 --> 00:22:01,872
You don't go to strangers.

476
00:22:01,872 --> 00:22:02,952
Do you have a college friend?

477
00:22:02,952 --> 00:22:03,792
I have a college friend.

478
00:22:03,792 --> 00:22:05,192
Everyone came to me.

479
00:22:05,192 --> 00:22:10,112
Thank you for watching.

480
00:22:11,112 --> 00:22:13,112
How can you get your friends to come to
you?

481
00:22:13,112 --> 00:22:15,112
I haven't done anything.

482
00:22:18,112 --> 00:22:20,112
I want to open a yakubo field.

483
00:22:20,112 --> 00:22:21,112
Me too.

484
00:22:21,112 --> 00:22:22,112
I think so.

485
00:22:22,112 --> 00:22:25,112
After that, I eat hot dogs alone.

486
00:22:25,112 --> 00:22:27,112
I feel sorry for you.

487
00:22:27,112 --> 00:22:30,112
Someone should invite you to that place.

488
00:22:30,112 --> 00:22:32,112
Saki-chan will come.

489
00:22:32,112 --> 00:22:34,112
Saki-chan won't go.

490
00:22:34,112 --> 00:22:36,112
She won't go.

491
00:22:36,112 --> 00:22:38,112
She may come because she likes me.

492
00:22:38,112 --> 00:22:40,112
Saki-chan doesn't like you.

493
00:22:42,112 --> 00:22:43,112
That's strange.

494
00:22:43,112 --> 00:22:46,112
But you should eat churros at the
university.

495
00:22:46,112 --> 00:22:48,112
I want to eat churros.

496
00:22:48,112 --> 00:22:50,112
I'm worried about what to do in the
future.

497
00:22:50,112 --> 00:22:51,112
Will you come?

498
00:22:51,112 --> 00:22:55,112
I recommend the emergency stairs.

499
00:22:55,112 --> 00:22:56,112
I see.

500
00:22:56,112 --> 00:22:58,112
Everyone is sad.

501
00:22:58,112 --> 00:23:00,112
Is it like that at the university?

502
00:23:00,112 --> 00:23:03,112
I can hear footsteps on the emergency
stairs.

503
00:23:03,112 --> 00:23:04,112
I can understand when someone comes.

504
00:23:04,112 --> 00:23:05,112
I'm glad.

505
00:23:05,112 --> 00:23:08,112
Why are you talking about sad things?

506
00:23:08,112 --> 00:23:14,976
To be continued.

507
00:23:15,976 --> 00:23:18,976
In the news broadcasted over the past
two weeks,

508
00:23:18,976 --> 00:23:23,760
the results of the

509
00:23:23,760 --> 00:23:25,760
Nobitaka B-Q NEWS

00:23:25,760 --> 00:23:27,760
The winner of the 2020 is

511
00:23:27,760 --> 00:23:29,760
Kuromi from April

512
00:23:29,760 --> 00:23:32,760
She is going to be an idol

513
00:23:32,760 --> 00:23:34,760
Kamakiri

514
00:23:35,760 --> 00:23:37,760
There is one more

515
00:23:37,760 --> 00:23:40,760
It's like a drama in June

516
00:23:40,760 --> 00:23:42,760
Rainy morning

Please let us have them

00:23:44,760 --> 00:23:47,760
Kuromi was really good this time

519
00:23:47,760 --> 00:23:49,760
She was really good

520
00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:52,760
She was really good from the
impersonation

521
00:23:52,760 --> 00:23:55,760
She is really popular

522
00:23:55,760 --> 00:23:59,760
She is famous in various radio shows

523
00:23:59,760 --> 00:24:01,760
She is famous in various radio shows

She is amazing

529
00:24:11,760 --> 00:24:13,760
She was touched

530
00:24:13,760 --> 00:24:15,760
She was touched

531
00:24:15,760 --> 00:24:17,760
How?

532
00:24:17,760 --> 00:24:19,760
When did she do that?

533
00:24:19,760 --> 00:24:24,760
When we were talking, she said she was
really good at impersonation

534
00:24:24,760 --> 00:24:25,760
Recently

535
00:24:25,760 --> 00:24:28,760
When I said let's do our best, she said
let's do our best

536
00:24:28,760 --> 00:24:30,760
When I said let's do our best, she said
let's do our best

Let's do our best
