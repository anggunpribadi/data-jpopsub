1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Ebichu no Douga Toka

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,000
【Ebichu no Douga Toka】

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,000
【Ebichu no Douga Toka】

4
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,000
I'm Hoshino Mirei, a trainee at Lucky7

5
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,000
Tell me, Hoshino-sensei!

6
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:11,000
Yes, yes, yes

7
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:14,000
When are you going to study the roots?

8
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Right now

9
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:17,000
So, today

10
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:20,000
I'll be teaching you

11
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:21,000
Let's write it down

12
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:25,914
In my easy-to-understand way

13
00:00:26,914 --> 00:00:27,914
Like this?

14
00:00:27,914 --> 00:00:29,914
Like this?

15
00:00:29,914 --> 00:00:33,914
I'd like to introduce you to peaches.

16
00:00:33,914 --> 00:00:34,914
This is a peach.

17
00:00:34,914 --> 00:00:36,914
This is a peach.

18
00:00:36,914 --> 00:00:37,914
Don't say you can't see it.

19
00:00:37,914 --> 00:00:38,914
This is a peach.

20
00:00:38,914 --> 00:00:41,914
Yes, peaches are either roses or
peaches.

21
00:00:41,914 --> 00:00:42,914
Oh, it's like a girl.

22
00:00:42,914 --> 00:00:43,914
Wonderful.

23
00:00:43,914 --> 00:00:50,914
There are three types of varieties,
white, white, and golden.

24
00:00:50,914 --> 00:00:54,914
From abroad, China and Europe.

25
00:00:55,056 --> 00:00:58,056
We import from Turkey and the US.

26
00:00:58,056 --> 00:01:01,056
In Japan, the first place is Yamanashi
Prefecture.

27
00:01:01,056 --> 00:01:03,056
The second place is Fukushima
Prefecture.

28
00:01:03,056 --> 00:01:05,056
The third place is Nagano Prefecture.

29
00:01:05,056 --> 00:01:11,056
About 70% of the total population is
imported.

30
00:01:11,056 --> 00:01:13,056
These three prefectures are the king of
peaches.

31
00:01:13,056 --> 00:01:16,056
Let's write it down. It's like a class.

32
00:01:16,056 --> 00:01:18,056
The first place is Yamanashi Prefecture.

33
00:01:18,056 --> 00:01:20,056
The second place is Fukushima
Prefecture.

34
00:01:20,056 --> 00:01:22,056
The third place is Nagano Prefecture.

35
00:01:22,056 --> 00:01:23,936
The peaches are so cute.

36
00:01:24,936 --> 00:01:26,936
The peach is so cute.

37
00:01:26,936 --> 00:01:28,936
Please remember that.

38
00:01:28,936 --> 00:01:30,936
The point is that it is cute.

39
00:01:30,936 --> 00:01:32,936
And the season is now.

40
00:01:32,936 --> 00:01:36,936
From early summer to summer.

41
00:01:36,936 --> 00:01:40,936
So, please eat peaches now.

42
00:01:40,936 --> 00:01:42,936
Choose delicious peaches.

43
00:01:44,056 --> 00:01:46,056
Choose red peaches.

44
00:01:47,056 --> 00:01:48,056
Choose red peaches.

45
00:01:49,056 --> 00:01:52,056
Why are my peaches symmetrical?

46
00:01:53,056 --> 00:01:57,056
Choose red peaches.

47
00:01:58,056 --> 00:02:01,056
Did you follow the peach lesson?

48
00:02:02,056 --> 00:02:03,056
Please remember.

49
00:02:03,056 --> 00:02:12,560
Varacan Peach Tribe China. Yamanashi
Fukushima Nagano.

50
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:15,560
Please eat delicious food like this.

51
00:02:15,560 --> 00:02:17,560
Bye bye.

52
00:02:17,560 --> 00:02:23,560
Today, I would like to introduce my
favorite fruit.

53
00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:27,560
Please guess what it is.

54
00:02:27,560 --> 00:02:35,560
It's easy.

55
00:02:35,610 --> 00:02:40,410
What is it? Is it shiny? It's shining.

56
00:02:40,410 --> 00:02:44,610
Yes, what is it? The correct answer is
Shine Muscat!

57
00:02:44,610 --> 00:02:48,610
Ah, it's Shine Muscat no matter how you
look at it.

58
00:02:48,610 --> 00:02:52,610
Yes, so I really like Shine Muscat.

59
00:02:52,610 --> 00:02:58,610
The reason I like it is because it's
eaten all over the river and it has a
taste even on the river.

60
00:02:58,610 --> 00:03:05,410
It's so delicious that it's quite
expensive, but I'll put up with it and
buy it.

61
00:03:05,410 --> 00:03:05,504
It is cote land

62
00:03:06,504 --> 00:03:12,504
Shine Muscat is made by mixing Akitsu 21
and Hakunan.

63
00:03:12,504 --> 00:03:14,504
Akitsu-san

64
00:03:15,504 --> 00:03:17,504
I couldn't read this at first.

65
00:03:18,504 --> 00:03:24,504
To explain it roughly, Akitsu-san is a
mixture of American and European grapes.

66
00:03:24,504 --> 00:03:29,504
Hakunan is a mixture of European grapes.

67
00:03:29,504 --> 00:03:33,488
Shine Muscat is the one that took it
well.

68
00:03:34,488 --> 00:03:37,488
It's a hybrid grape.

69
00:03:38,488 --> 00:03:42,488
It's easy to eat the whole skin.

70
00:03:43,488 --> 00:03:45,488
And there are few seeds.

71
00:03:46,488 --> 00:03:47,488
1st place is Nagano Prefecture.

72
00:03:48,488 --> 00:03:50,488
2nd place is Yamanashi Prefecture.

73
00:03:51,488 --> 00:03:53,488
These two prefectures are the second
strongest.

74
00:03:53,488 --> 00:03:56,176
These two are the fruit empire.

75
00:03:57,176 --> 00:04:11,176
You can eat it at room temperature, but
if you put it in the refrigerator 2-3
hours before and eat it cold, it will
pop in your mouth.

76
00:04:11,176 --> 00:04:15,176
It's really delicious. I love it.

77
00:04:15,176 --> 00:04:20,176
Did you get a little more information
about Shine Muscat?

78
00:04:20,176 --> 00:04:23,176
I'll put it in the test, so remember it.

79
00:04:23,176 --> 00:04:25,176
Bye bye.

80
00:04:26,328 --> 00:04:30,328
It took 3 minutes for everyone to be
quiet.

81
00:04:30,328 --> 00:04:31,328
What do you mean?

82
00:04:31,328 --> 00:04:33,328
Are you serious about the class?

83
00:04:33,328 --> 00:04:35,328
Let's switch.

84
00:04:35,328 --> 00:04:37,328
I'm scared.

85
00:04:37,328 --> 00:04:39,328
Today's fruit is...

86
00:04:39,328 --> 00:04:43,546
See you next time.

87
00:04:43,546 --> 00:04:45,546
Ta-da! This is it!

88
00:04:45,546 --> 00:04:47,546
What is it?

89
00:04:47,546 --> 00:04:49,546
No matter how you look at it, it's a
mango!

90
00:04:49,546 --> 00:04:51,546
I could only write this.

91
00:04:51,546 --> 00:04:53,546
Mango is

92
00:04:53,546 --> 00:04:55,546
Mukurojime

93
00:04:55,546 --> 00:04:57,546
Urushika

94
00:04:57,546 --> 00:04:59,546
What are you saying?

95
00:04:59,546 --> 00:05:01,546
Mu-ku-ro-ji

96
00:05:01,546 --> 00:05:03,546
Mukurojimoku?

97
00:05:03,546 --> 00:05:06,160
Urushika!

98
00:05:07,160 --> 00:05:09,160
What is Mukurojimoku?

99
00:05:09,160 --> 00:05:12,160
I thought it was a glaring eye, but it's
not.

100
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:17,160
It's a Urushika mango that came to me
and glared at me.

101
00:05:17,160 --> 00:05:20,160
It's easy to remember!

102
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:28,160
The first mango I ate was the Pelican
mango, which is popular in Southeast
Asia.

103
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:30,160
I was surprised.

104
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:34,896
From there, I was also addicted to the
dry fruit mango.

105
00:05:35,896 --> 00:05:40,896
The highest production in Japan is
Okinawa, and the second is Miyazaki.

106
00:05:40,896 --> 00:05:50,896
I thought Miyazaki was the best, but
it's famous for its sunny eggs.

107
00:05:50,896 --> 00:05:54,896
But Okinawa is the best.

108
00:05:54,896 --> 00:05:57,896
Did you remember?

109
00:05:57,896 --> 00:06:03,896
The season is May to August.

110
00:06:04,464 --> 00:06:08,064
The best part of mango for me and my mom
is

111
00:06:08,064 --> 00:06:11,164
the part where you eat the seed.

112
00:06:11,164 --> 00:06:14,264
The seed is so delicious.

113
00:06:14,264 --> 00:06:18,164
When I'm cutting it, I'm eating the seed
by myself.

114
00:06:18,164 --> 00:06:19,564
It's so delicious.

115
00:06:19,564 --> 00:06:22,064
So, like this, everyone.

116
00:06:22,064 --> 00:06:24,664
Today, we talked about mango.

117
00:06:24,664 --> 00:06:28,064
Did you learn about the Mukujiro
Urushika Mango tribe?

118
00:06:28,064 --> 00:06:31,264
I'd like to end the lesson here.

119
00:06:31,264 --> 00:06:32,768
Bye bye.

120
00:06:33,768 --> 00:06:35,768
It's summer break.

121
00:06:35,768 --> 00:06:38,768
The difference is how much you study in
summer break.

122
00:06:38,768 --> 00:06:41,768
Let's do our best.

123
00:06:41,768 --> 00:06:44,768
I'll write the fruit of the day.

124
00:06:44,768 --> 00:06:53,768
I know this. I know this. I know this.

125
00:06:55,448 --> 00:06:56,448
Strawberry!

126
00:06:56,448 --> 00:06:57,448
Strawberry!

127
00:06:57,448 --> 00:07:02,448
Strawberry is a type of rose or other
plant and it belongs to the Dutch
strawberry family.

128
00:07:02,448 --> 00:07:05,448
I have a big news for you!

129
00:07:05,448 --> 00:07:10,448
The part where I eat the strawberry is
not a fruit!

130
00:07:10,448 --> 00:07:11,448
It's surprising, isn't it?

131
00:07:11,448 --> 00:07:15,448
It looks like a fruit but it's not.

132
00:07:15,448 --> 00:07:16,448
It's shocking.

133
00:07:16,448 --> 00:07:18,448
It's a flower.

134
00:07:18,448 --> 00:07:22,448
There are many types of strawberries.

135
00:07:22,448 --> 00:07:23,792
It's called Amao.

136
00:07:23,792 --> 00:07:28,012
Beni-hoppe, Tochi-otome, Sachi-no-ka,
Saga-ho-no-ka.

137
00:07:28,012 --> 00:07:32,852
These five varieties make up 80% of the
total in Japan.

138
00:07:32,852 --> 00:07:48,416
Amao, Beni-hoppe, Tochi-otome, Sachi-no-
ka, Saga-ho-no-ka.

139
00:07:49,416 --> 00:07:54,416
These five types have a total of 80% of
the votes.

140
00:07:54,416 --> 00:07:57,416
Now, let's say it together!

141
00:07:57,416 --> 00:08:01,416
Amao, Beni-hoppe, Tochi-otome, Sachi-no-
ka, Saga-ho-no-ka!

142
00:08:01,416 --> 00:08:02,416
Yes!

143
00:08:02,416 --> 00:08:05,416
Hmm? Did I say it right?

144
00:08:05,416 --> 00:08:08,416
Well, never mind. I'm not trying to
mishear you.

145
00:08:08,416 --> 00:08:11,416
I'm going to say it here. Please
remember it.

146
00:08:11,416 --> 00:08:12,336
Where?

147
00:08:13,336 --> 00:08:15,336
I'm going to say it here.

148
00:08:16,336 --> 00:08:18,336
1st place is Tochigi.

149
00:08:19,336 --> 00:08:21,336
2nd place is Fukuoka.

150
00:08:22,336 --> 00:08:24,336
3rd place is Kumamoto.

151
00:08:25,336 --> 00:08:29,336
I thought it was January to May.

152
00:08:30,336 --> 00:08:33,336
I talked about strawberries today.

153
00:08:34,336 --> 00:08:35,336
Did you listen to me?

154
00:08:36,336 --> 00:08:39,336
I'm going to end the strawberry class.

155
00:08:39,336 --> 00:08:41,336
Bye bye.

156
00:08:42,824 --> 00:08:44,824
The basics are important for studying.

157
00:08:44,824 --> 00:08:48,824
Let's solidify the basics and move on to
the next one.

158
00:08:48,824 --> 00:08:53,824
Today's Tsuru-tsu is this.

159
00:08:54,756 --> 00:08:56,656
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh!

160
00:08:56,656 --> 00:08:58,416
Oh! I'm pretty good at this!

161
00:08:58,416 --> 00:08:59,416
It's melon!

162
00:08:59,416 --> 00:09:00,696
This is so easy to understand!

163
00:09:00,696 --> 00:09:02,336
I feel like it's the easiest to
understand.

164
00:09:02,336 --> 00:09:04,716
In terms of plant science, it's the same
as watermelons.

165
00:09:04,716 --> 00:09:06,816
It's a cucumber plant.

166
00:09:06,816 --> 00:09:07,936
It's a vegetable, right?

167
00:09:07,936 --> 00:09:10,156
But what's normally distributed is...

168
00:09:10,156 --> 00:09:12,296
It's distributed as a fruit.

169
00:09:12,296 --> 00:09:15,296
It's usually a fruit.

170
00:09:15,296 --> 00:09:17,616
Cucumber plant.

171
00:09:17,616 --> 00:09:18,416
Everyone, did you remember?

172
00:09:18,416 --> 00:09:19,856
It's a cucumber plant.

173
00:09:19,856 --> 00:09:22,256
It's surprisingly vegetable-like, this
name.

174
00:09:22,256 --> 00:09:22,288
It's a cucumber plant.

175
00:09:23,288 --> 00:09:26,288
The variety is net type and netless.

176
00:09:26,288 --> 00:09:28,288
And both of them have Prince Melon.

177
00:09:28,288 --> 00:09:30,288
It seems that there is also a melon of
good place.

178
00:09:30,288 --> 00:09:32,288
The season is from May to July.

179
00:09:32,288 --> 00:09:35,288
It's a little late now.

180
00:09:35,288 --> 00:09:36,288
But still.

181
00:09:36,288 --> 00:09:39,288
I think it's probably in the
supermarket.

182
00:09:39,288 --> 00:09:40,288
Please try it.

183
00:09:40,288 --> 00:09:42,288
The production amount is.

184
00:09:42,288 --> 00:09:44,288
Ibaraki is the first place.

185
00:09:44,288 --> 00:09:46,288
The second place is Hokkaido.

186
00:09:46,288 --> 00:09:47,288
I have a lot of melon images.

187
00:09:47,288 --> 00:09:49,288
And third place is Kumamoto.

188
00:09:49,288 --> 00:09:52,288
How to choose a delicious melon.

189
00:09:52,612 --> 00:09:54,972
If you want it to be sweeter

190
00:09:55,452 --> 00:10:00,032
you can choose the one shaped like a net

191
00:10:00,032 --> 00:10:01,092
and you will save money

192
00:10:01,592 --> 00:10:04,552
but there is an App for this time-

193
00:10:04,772 --> 00:10:07,812
you want to buy it and try for yourself

194
00:10:07,812 --> 00:10:11,440
than being in a yes hand with that kind
of mind to check the GTA

195
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:16,120
It's packed with meat and it's really
good.

196
00:10:16,120 --> 00:10:18,120
How to eat delicious melon.

197
00:10:18,120 --> 00:10:23,080
I wanted to eat it, so I put it in the
refrigerator about 3 to 5 hours before.

198
00:10:23,080 --> 00:10:26,128
It's really cool and delicious when you
cut it and eat it.

199
00:10:27,128 --> 00:10:33,128
And for adults, it's like a brandy with
raw ham.

200
00:10:33,128 --> 00:10:34,128
It's a little mature.

201
00:10:34,128 --> 00:10:36,128
Raw ham melon is really delicious.

202
00:10:36,128 --> 00:10:39,128
Children can eat it with vanilla ice
cream.

203
00:10:39,128 --> 00:10:44,128
I think the whole family can enjoy this
big melon.

204
00:10:44,128 --> 00:10:46,128
Please try it with everyone.

205
00:10:46,128 --> 00:10:49,128
That's it for the class.

206
00:10:49,128 --> 00:10:51,128
Bye bye.

207
00:10:51,128 --> 00:10:53,128
This is the last class today.

208
00:10:53,128 --> 00:10:55,328
Thank you for watching.

209
00:10:56,328 --> 00:11:01,328
I hope you all do your best and enjoy
the class.

210
00:11:01,328 --> 00:11:07,328
I will draw the fruit I will introduce
today.

211
00:11:08,328 --> 00:11:10,328
It's full of horns.

212
00:11:10,328 --> 00:11:11,328
What is it?

213
00:11:11,328 --> 00:11:14,328
The correct answer is lychee.

214
00:11:14,328 --> 00:11:16,080
Where is the lychee?

215
00:11:17,080 --> 00:11:18,080
I don't know.

216
00:11:18,080 --> 00:11:20,080
Lychee is also that.

217
00:11:20,080 --> 00:11:22,080
Mukurojika.

218
00:11:22,080 --> 00:11:24,080
I got it. Mukurojika.

219
00:11:24,080 --> 00:11:26,080
What kind of mukurojika was it?

220
00:11:26,080 --> 00:11:28,080
It's mango. It's the same as mango.

221
00:11:28,080 --> 00:11:30,080
Mukurojika.

222
00:11:30,080 --> 00:11:32,080
And lychee has kanji.

223
00:11:32,080 --> 00:11:34,080
Kusakaite.

224
00:11:34,080 --> 00:11:36,080
Toto...

225
00:11:36,080 --> 00:11:38,080
Kishi.

226
00:11:38,080 --> 00:11:42,080
I imagined a shinomiya with a pair of
jeans.

227
00:11:42,080 --> 00:11:42,928
It's a pair of jeans.

228
00:11:43,928 --> 00:11:44,928
I remembered!

229
00:11:44,928 --> 00:11:46,928
Everyone can write Raichi with this!

230
00:11:46,928 --> 00:11:49,928
In Japan, the letter C is Kagoshima.

231
00:11:49,928 --> 00:11:51,928
You can write it in a warm place.

232
00:11:51,928 --> 00:11:52,928
Miyazaki.

233
00:11:52,928 --> 00:11:56,928
Raichi is in the middle of May to early
August.

234
00:11:56,928 --> 00:11:59,928
It's a last chance.

235
00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:02,600
There is a type called Green Lychee.

236
00:12:02,600 --> 00:12:10,280
It is said that it was sold under the
name of Hishishou because it was so
delicious that it made Chinese people
smile.

237
00:12:10,280 --> 00:12:12,080
Hishishou.

238
00:12:12,080 --> 00:12:13,792
I came here and I felt it a lot.

239
00:12:14,792 --> 00:12:16,792
Did you remember?

240
00:12:16,792 --> 00:12:19,792
Lychee is full of vitamin C.

241
00:12:19,792 --> 00:12:22,792
Lychee is small.

242
00:12:22,792 --> 00:12:26,792
4 Lychee is equivalent to 1 lemon.

243
00:12:26,792 --> 00:12:32,792
Vitamin C has the effect of preventing
colds and skin diseases.

244
00:12:32,792 --> 00:12:34,592
So especially on a sunny day, Lychee and
sugar,

245
00:12:35,592 --> 00:12:37,592
If you eat 4 of them, you might be able
to recover the next day.

246
00:12:38,592 --> 00:12:40,592
You don't see Lychee that often, do you?

247
00:12:41,592 --> 00:12:45,592
If you see it, buy it, and freeze it, it
will last for a year.

248
00:12:46,592 --> 00:12:47,592
Wonderful!

249
00:12:48,592 --> 00:12:50,592
Thank you for listening to the class
until the end.

250
00:12:51,592 --> 00:12:52,592
I introduced 6 of them this time.

251
00:12:53,592 --> 00:12:55,592
Did you get to know more about fruit?

252
00:12:56,592 --> 00:12:58,592
See you somewhere!

253
00:12:58,592 --> 00:12:59,592
Bye bye!

254
00:13:00,592 --> 00:13:01,592
To be continued.

255
00:13:01,592 --> 00:13:04,080
It's time to go out.

256
00:13:05,080 --> 00:13:08,080
I think you've learned a lot about
fruits in a week.

257
00:13:08,080 --> 00:13:12,080
I think the questions I'm going to ask
you are very easy.

258
00:13:12,080 --> 00:13:14,080
Let's get started.

259
00:13:14,080 --> 00:13:17,584
These were the fruits that are popular
all over the country.

260
00:13:18,584 --> 00:13:19,584
Question 1

261
00:13:19,584 --> 00:13:22,584
What is Hoshina Mirei's favorite fruit?

262
00:13:22,584 --> 00:13:37,008
This is easy. I told you.

263
00:13:38,008 --> 00:13:40,008
What is your favorite season now?

264
00:13:41,008 --> 00:13:44,008
I like all kinds of fruits.

265
00:13:45,008 --> 00:13:47,008
I like seasonal fruits the most.

266
00:13:48,008 --> 00:13:51,008
I like Shine Muscat the most.

267
00:13:52,008 --> 00:13:54,008
The second question.

268
00:13:55,008 --> 00:13:58,008
What kind of fruit is Milly not good at?

269
00:13:59,008 --> 00:14:00,008
Do you know?

270
00:14:01,008 --> 00:14:02,008
Do you know?

271
00:14:02,008 --> 00:14:05,008
You don't know this.

272
00:14:07,624 --> 00:14:10,624
I'm going to announce the correct
answer.

273
00:14:10,624 --> 00:14:12,624
Do you have the answer?

274
00:14:12,624 --> 00:14:22,810
Let's see the correct answer.

275
00:14:22,810 --> 00:14:24,810
I have no idea.

276
00:14:24,810 --> 00:14:26,810
I have no idea.

277
00:14:26,810 --> 00:14:28,810
Did I get it right?

278
00:14:28,810 --> 00:14:30,810
I was talking with Ucchi.

279
00:14:30,810 --> 00:14:32,810
I was talking with Ucchi.

280
00:14:32,810 --> 00:14:34,810
Where did I eat it?

281
00:14:34,810 --> 00:14:36,810
I ate durian.

282
00:14:36,810 --> 00:14:38,810
I ate durian.

283
00:14:38,810 --> 00:14:40,810
I was told that it was very smelly.

284
00:14:40,810 --> 00:14:42,810
I was told that it was very smelly.

285
00:14:42,810 --> 00:14:44,810
I think I got it right.

286
00:14:44,810 --> 00:14:46,810
I will challenge strange fruits.

287
00:14:46,810 --> 00:14:48,810
I will challenge strange fruits.

288
00:14:48,810 --> 00:14:50,810
Did I get it right?

289
00:14:50,810 --> 00:14:51,360
I will challenge strange fruits.

290
00:14:52,360 --> 00:14:54,360
You are all great.

291
00:14:54,360 --> 00:14:57,360
You are my students.

292
00:14:57,360 --> 00:15:01,424
Let's start the third question.

293
00:15:02,424 --> 00:15:04,424
What is your favorite fruit?

294
00:15:04,424 --> 00:15:06,424
This is...

295
00:15:06,424 --> 00:15:08,424
What is it?

296
00:15:08,424 --> 00:15:13,424
I haven't been able to answer this
question in the past week.

297
00:15:13,424 --> 00:15:21,424
But I'm glad to have answered this
question.

298
00:15:21,424 --> 00:15:26,352
So, everyone, is the answer correct?

299
00:15:26,352 --> 00:15:28,752
I would like to announce the correct
answer.

300
00:15:29,352 --> 00:15:30,352
The correct answer is...

301
00:15:31,472 --> 00:15:32,472
Sakuranbo!

302
00:15:33,672 --> 00:15:36,692
My grandmother's house is in Yamagata

303
00:15:36,692 --> 00:15:38,032
and since I was little

304
00:15:38,592 --> 00:15:41,592
I've been going to Sakuranbo hunting.

305
00:15:41,592 --> 00:15:44,732
And at that time, it was a very
memorable time for me.

306
00:15:45,032 --> 00:15:46,032
And this year,

307
00:15:46,232 --> 00:15:49,232
I was able to get a present from
Yamagata Prefecture.

308
00:15:49,232 --> 00:15:52,560
I'm so happy! Thank you! Thank you,
Grandma!

309
00:15:53,560 --> 00:15:54,560
It's different!

310
00:15:54,560 --> 00:16:00,560
The difference between buying it at a
supermarket and the one my grandma sends
me is the thickness of the meat.

311
00:16:00,560 --> 00:16:02,560
The sweetness is also great.

312
00:16:02,560 --> 00:16:06,560
When I was little, I often said I wanted
to fly seeds.

313
00:16:06,560 --> 00:16:12,560
So I took the seeds and competed to see
how far I could fly.

314
00:16:12,560 --> 00:16:15,560
The point is to put on the clothes and
do it.

315
00:16:15,560 --> 00:16:17,560
Everyone, please remember.

316
00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:20,560
Then I will continue.

317
00:16:20,560 --> 00:16:22,560
Question 4

318
00:16:23,688 --> 00:16:25,688
What fruit does Mirie want to grow?

319
00:16:26,688 --> 00:16:29,688
This is a hint.

320
00:16:29,688 --> 00:16:30,688
The hint is...

321
00:16:31,688 --> 00:16:36,688
If it's this, I think I can grow it too.

322
00:16:36,688 --> 00:16:38,688
That's the size.

323
00:16:38,688 --> 00:16:42,688
Then I will announce the correct answer.

324
00:16:42,688 --> 00:16:43,688
The correct answer is...

325
00:16:46,688 --> 00:16:47,688
Blueberry!

326
00:16:47,688 --> 00:16:51,072
I searched and found it.

327
00:16:52,072 --> 00:16:54,072
It's easy.

328
00:16:57,072 --> 00:17:00,072
It's sweet, but it's sour.

329
00:17:02,072 --> 00:17:05,072
I don't think I'll notice if I fail.

330
00:17:07,072 --> 00:17:10,072
I'll put it on ice cream and eat it.

331
00:17:13,072 --> 00:17:15,072
I'll ask you the last question.

332
00:17:16,072 --> 00:17:19,072
How many correct answers are there in
these four questions?

333
00:17:19,072 --> 00:17:20,072
Last question.

334
00:17:21,864 --> 00:17:26,864
I will give you 10 points for each
correct answer.

335
00:17:26,864 --> 00:17:28,864
Please try your best.

336
00:17:29,864 --> 00:17:30,864
You will never know the answer.

337
00:17:31,864 --> 00:17:32,864
The fifth question.

338
00:17:32,864 --> 00:17:34,864
What is the unknown fruit of the bush
nabire?

339
00:17:35,864 --> 00:17:39,864
I have never eaten this fruit before.

340
00:17:40,864 --> 00:17:44,864
I have eaten it, but I have never eaten
this fruit.

341
00:17:44,864 --> 00:17:49,864
I have never eaten this fruit, but I
think I will never know the answer.

342
00:17:51,608 --> 00:17:53,608
I think no one will know the answer.

343
00:17:53,608 --> 00:17:55,608
I will give you a great hint.

344
00:17:55,608 --> 00:18:07,608
This is the kind of fruit that has
appeared in the previous video.

345
00:18:07,608 --> 00:18:10,608
Please think about it.

346
00:18:10,608 --> 00:18:16,608
I have given you a great hint, so I will
announce the correct answer.

347
00:18:16,608 --> 00:18:19,408
The correct answer is...

348
00:18:20,408 --> 00:18:23,408
It's a strawberry called Tochihime.

349
00:18:23,408 --> 00:18:26,408
I'm sure I haven't got it right.

350
00:18:26,408 --> 00:18:28,408
I think the person who got it right is a
super smart.

351
00:18:28,408 --> 00:18:34,408
It's a strawberry made of Tochigi, but
it's too soft.

352
00:18:34,408 --> 00:18:38,408
It's also very sweet and delicious.

353
00:18:38,408 --> 00:18:42,408
It's too soft to be shipped to the
market.

354
00:18:42,408 --> 00:18:48,408
It's so soft and delicious that you
can't go to the strawberry market.

355
00:18:48,408 --> 00:18:48,560
I'm sure I haven't got it right.

356
00:18:49,560 --> 00:18:56,560
I couldn't go to the strawberry market
this year, so I'd like to go to Tochigi
next year.

357
00:18:57,560 --> 00:19:01,560
How many questions have I answered so
far?

358
00:19:02,560 --> 00:19:07,560
My favorite fruit is Chai Muscat.

359
00:19:08,560 --> 00:19:13,560
And I don't like fruits that I'm not
good at.

360
00:19:13,560 --> 00:19:17,168
I'm not good at fruits.

361
00:19:17,168 --> 00:19:24,768
There were a lot of fruits, so I think I
can try it someday.

362
00:19:24,768 --> 00:19:29,648
And the fruit of memories is cherry
blossoms. Thank you for always
remembering.

363
00:19:29,648 --> 00:19:32,688
The fruit I want to see while growing up
is blueberry.

364
00:19:32,688 --> 00:19:34,688
It looks easy.

365
00:19:34,688 --> 00:19:37,968
And the fruit of unknown is princess
land.

366
00:19:37,968 --> 00:19:39,968
Someday I will be a princess land.

367
00:19:39,968 --> 00:19:41,568
It's a little strange.

368
00:19:41,568 --> 00:19:45,248
I love fruit that I can't eat.

369
00:19:45,248 --> 00:19:46,912
I want to be a fruit master.

370
00:19:47,912 --> 00:19:49,912
I hope I can eat various things.

371
00:19:49,912 --> 00:19:51,912
Thank you everyone.

372
00:19:51,912 --> 00:19:53,912
It doesn't matter at all.

373
00:19:53,912 --> 00:19:56,912
Please study fruit properly.

374
00:19:56,912 --> 00:20:01,681
Bye bye.
