[Nogizaka Under Construction](/tag/nogizaka-under-construction/) this time, we are praying for a hit with our 34th single! Second half! W Center's Endo & Kaki take on the challenge of climbing Japan's highest staircase with 3333 steps in Kumamoto Prefecture!

Work together to clear the 10 missions that appear midway up the stairs and aim for the top! However, if you fail the mission, a hellish rule will be activated that will set you back 100 steps! Will the two of them be able to successfully reach their goal while various missions stand in their way? ?
