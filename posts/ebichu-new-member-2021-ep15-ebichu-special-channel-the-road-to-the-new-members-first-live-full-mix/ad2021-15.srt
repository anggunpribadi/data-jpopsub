00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Lesson Day 2

2
00:00:06,650 --> 00:00:08,650
I'm so excited.

3
00:00:12,650 --> 00:00:14,650
I used to do it with this suit.

4
00:00:14,650 --> 00:00:17,650
It's always been a long time since I did
it.

5
00:00:17,650 --> 00:00:20,650
I was absent yesterday.

6
00:00:20,650 --> 00:00:23,650
I will join quietly today.

7
00:00:23,650 --> 00:00:24,650
I was so excited.

8
00:00:24,650 --> 00:00:27,650
I got advice from my senior.

9
00:00:27,650 --> 00:00:29,650
I'm a muscle trainer.

10
00:00:29,650 --> 00:00:32,650
I'm going to go up and down.

11
00:00:32,650 --> 00:00:33,650
I was half-assed.

12
00:00:33,650 --> 00:00:35,650
I was half-assed.

13
00:00:35,650 --> 00:00:39,650
I'm going to do two-times pull-ups.

14
00:00:39,650 --> 00:00:45,792
I'm going to do two-times pull-ups.

15
00:00:45,792 --> 00:00:52,792
The new formation lesson has started
with the new members for the fan meeting

16
00:00:53,792 --> 00:00:55,792
Today, they will perform

17
00:01:01,792 --> 00:01:07,792
The song that represents the shrimp-chew
that has been sung by the first fan
meeting,

18
00:01:07,792 --> 00:01:12,954
I want to seduce you

19
00:01:12,954 --> 00:01:13,754
Which team will win the competition?

20
00:01:13,754 --> 00:01:16,014
Which team will win the competition?

21
00:01:16,454 --> 00:01:19,314
They will make their BLACKPINK formation
into eight.

22
00:01:19,314 --> 00:01:20,654
ATTENTION!

23
00:01:20,914 --> 00:01:22,954
First, a song for the song.

24
00:01:27,314 --> 00:01:28,794
Turn back data's had only one page.

25
00:01:28,794 --> 00:01:30,714
Like the turn back...

26
00:01:30,714 --> 00:01:33,994
Sraz multiplies brain

27
00:01:33,994 --> 00:01:37,634
Thank you for watching!

28
00:01:37,658 --> 00:01:42,658
The new members practiced this song even
during the audition training.

29
00:01:42,658 --> 00:01:52,224
They looked like they were able to dance
without any problems.

30
00:01:52,224 --> 00:02:22,224
the leader time

31
00:02:22,224 --> 00:02:30,224
The choreography was in his head to some
extent, but it's still far from perfect.

32
00:02:31,696 --> 00:02:34,296
In the first half of the show,

33
00:02:34,296 --> 00:02:35,996
the south part of the secretary came out
like this,

34
00:02:36,096 --> 00:02:39,196
but she Innovation undViolation

35
00:02:42,396 --> 00:02:34,856
So it's

36
00:02:34,856 --> 00:02:37,856
We found a lot of new pieces here

37
00:02:37,856 --> 00:02:40,416
M Somehow, daigah Isa

38
00:02:41,296 --> 00:02:42,556
Senior writer tunnel

39
00:02:42,556 --> 00:02:46,756
Senior writers sew packages for the
trainees

40
00:02:46,756 --> 00:02:48,756
Thank you for watching!

41
00:02:55,258 --> 00:02:57,258
And then...

42
00:02:57,258 --> 00:03:00,758
Next, we'll have lunch and then have a
meeting.

43
00:03:00,758 --> 00:03:09,050
Please take a break.

44
00:03:09,050 --> 00:03:27,216
We'll participate on a par withamin &

45
00:03:27,216 --> 00:03:29,216
here is Yuno standing

46
00:03:41,824 --> 00:03:43,824
I'll show you how to do it.

47
00:03:43,824 --> 00:03:45,824
Turn your back.

48
00:03:45,824 --> 00:03:47,824
And then you can do it like this.

49
00:03:47,824 --> 00:04:01,242
5, 6, 7, 8.

50
00:04:01,242 --> 00:04:09,602
By moving them and dancing now, all
three women become confused

51
00:04:11,822 --> 00:04:15,742
The one who carefully follows her new
members

52
00:04:23,362 --> 00:04:25,222
Riina is suspicious

53
00:04:25,762 --> 00:04:02,962
Wonderful

54
00:04:02,962 --> 00:04:05,922
Broad offers the opportunity to show a
stage brand

55
00:04:05,922 --> 00:04:08,242
Their choreography needs to be a good
one

56
00:04:08,242 --> 00:04:09,842
and the mission is very challenging

57
00:04:11,902 --> 00:04:15,822
In thats context, they actively follow
the new members

58
00:04:17,402 --> 00:04:20,882
Yu secret

59
00:04:21,922 --> 00:04:23,922
There are only three people

60
00:04:23,922 --> 00:04:25,862
I'm actually not happy.

61
00:04:26,062 --> 00:04:31,522
NiziU, over their delicious food...

62
00:04:33,760 --> 00:04:58,460
They are teachers and

63
00:05:18,682 --> 00:05:22,682
I want to be loved by you forever

64
00:05:22,682 --> 00:05:29,850
I want to be loved by you forever

65
00:05:48,154 --> 00:06:03,474
I was

66
00:06:06,938 --> 00:06:08,938
It's totally different from the 8th

67
00:06:08,938 --> 00:06:10,938
Totally different

68
00:06:10,938 --> 00:06:12,938
The location and the movement are
difficult

69
00:06:12,938 --> 00:06:14,938
I can't remember at all

70
00:06:14,938 --> 00:06:16,938
Difficult

71
00:06:16,938 --> 00:06:35,938
The formation is checked over 2 hours

72
00:06:36,154 --> 00:06:39,174
Are you ready?

73
00:06:48,674 --> 00:06:50,794
And the fourth time

74
00:06:51,590 --> 00:06:57,590
I want to dance

75
00:07:12,590 --> 00:07:15,590
Don't be afraid of the future

76
00:07:15,590 --> 00:07:19,590
Just a little more

77
00:07:19,590 --> 00:07:23,590
Just a little more

78
00:07:23,590 --> 00:07:27,590
Your smile is so beautiful

79
00:07:27,590 --> 00:07:30,714
Don't be afraid of the future

80
00:07:30,714 --> 00:07:32,714
Thank you for watching!

81
00:07:33,510 --> 00:07:35,510
I want to be able to see you

82
00:07:35,510 --> 00:07:39,510
I want to find the number of times I can
see you

83
00:07:39,510 --> 00:07:41,510
I can't stop the time

84
00:07:41,510 --> 00:07:44,510
You are the skyline

85
00:07:44,510 --> 00:07:50,510
I'm so happy that I can't stop you

86
00:07:50,510 --> 00:07:53,510
I know that there is a world

87
00:07:53,510 --> 00:07:58,510
That doesn't change even if we don't
meet

88
00:07:58,510 --> 00:08:06,510
I want to embrace the courage of an
unchanging life

89
00:08:06,510 --> 00:08:10,510
I wonder if I'll miss tomorrow

90
00:08:10,510 --> 00:08:14,510
I remember you

91
00:08:14,510 --> 00:08:25,402
I want to see you

92
00:08:25,402 --> 00:08:30,402
Somehow, he managed to dance without
making a mistake in the formation.

93
00:08:30,816 --> 00:08:36,656
You might be a little tired, but you'll
be able to do this kind of thing in the
future.

94
00:08:36,656 --> 00:08:41,156
And I think it's amazing that you're
dancing while looking at the side.

95
00:08:41,156 --> 00:08:44,156
The lines are all together, so I think
it's a good idea.

96
00:08:44,156 --> 00:08:46,756
I hope you'll be able to do it in the
future.

97
00:08:46,756 --> 00:08:49,496
That's all for today. Thank you.

98
00:08:49,496 --> 00:08:52,496
Thank you very much.

99
00:08:53,256 --> 00:08:55,456
Can I ask you a question?

100
00:08:55,456 --> 00:08:57,996
I'm a person who can remember the place.

101
00:08:57,996 --> 00:09:00,996
I'll practice a lot. I'll do my best.

102
00:09:00,996 --> 00:09:03,496
It's difficult.

103
00:09:03,496 --> 00:09:07,496
It's a formation.

104
00:09:07,496 --> 00:09:10,496
It's very heartwarming to have three
people.

105
00:09:10,496 --> 00:09:13,496
I still want to seduce them.

106
00:09:13,496 --> 00:09:16,996
I was doing an audition, so I was okay.

107
00:09:16,996 --> 00:09:20,996
I think it will be difficult to do other
things from now on.

108
00:09:20,996 --> 00:09:29,996
The new members will perform one stage
full performance as a private school.

109
00:09:29,996 --> 00:09:38,138
In other words, the songs you have to
remember exceed 20.

110
00:09:38,138 --> 00:09:42,138
The pressure is not only for the new
members.

111
00:09:42,138 --> 00:09:47,138
As the number of members increases, the
choreography becomes more organized.

112
00:09:47,138 --> 00:09:50,138
The moves are also different.

113
00:09:50,138 --> 00:09:57,138
Some parts of the choreography are
broken, but there are parts that are not
in sync with the three members.

114
00:09:57,138 --> 00:10:02,138
I want to work hard to make it more
harmonious.

115
00:10:02,138 --> 00:10:06,138
And the most pressure was...

116
00:10:06,138 --> 00:10:10,138
I have to teach the choreography, not
the teacher.

117
00:10:10,138 --> 00:10:14,138
There are many things that I have to do
as a teacher.

118
00:10:14,138 --> 00:10:17,138
I'm also worried about that.

119
00:10:17,138 --> 00:10:22,138
She is responsible as an educator and
dance director.

120
00:10:22,138 --> 00:10:26,138
70 days until the fan meeting.

121
00:10:26,138 --> 00:10:30,138
Next time, Kashiwagi Sensei's intense
lesson begins.

122
00:10:30,138 --> 00:10:33,138
Next time, I will show you the
choreography of the new member.

123
00:10:33,138 --> 00:10:36,021
Next time, I will show you the
choreography of the new member.
