D Mack

3
00:00:06,736 --> 00:00:10,936
If you are practicing ETS, it would be
great.

4
00:00:10,960 --> 00:00:15,960
I didn't think that there would be a
time when I sing all of my favorite
songs in Korean.

5
00:00:15,960 --> 00:00:18,960
I was surprised when I was sent.

6
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:20,960
Korean!

7
00:00:21,960 --> 00:00:23,960
But I have to deliver it.

8
00:00:23,960 --> 00:00:25,960
Korean songs.

9
00:00:25,960 --> 00:00:28,960
I'm sure you'll watch it.

10
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:30,960
It's still growing.

11
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:32,960
Music video and so on.

12
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:35,232
I'm sure you'll watch it.

13
00:00:36,232 --> 00:00:38,232
We want to get 10 million views.

14
00:00:38,232 --> 00:00:40,232
I can't wait.

15
00:00:41,232 --> 00:00:42,232
It's cute.

16
00:00:42,232 --> 00:00:43,232
It's good.

17
00:00:46,272 --> 00:00:48,272
I'm so happy.

18
00:00:48,272 --> 00:00:52,272
It would be great if we could have a
conversation.

19
00:01:02,880 --> 00:01:04,880
Bye-bye!

20
00:01:07,552 --> 00:01:09,552
OK!

21
00:01:10,554 --> 00:01:11,554
Oh!

22
00:01:11,554 --> 00:01:12,554

23
00:01:12,554 --> 00:01:13,554

24
00:01:13,554 --> 00:01:14,554
Cha!

25
00:01:14,554 --> 00:01:15,554
I did it!

26
00:01:15,554 --> 00:01:18,086
Some ниил

27
00:01:18,326 --> 00:01:21,526
NiziU members have TVXQ in theirbacks
words and actions after theIVE Rising
Star program.

28
00:01:21,526 --> 00:01:23,526
Bye!

29
00:01:24,314 --> 00:01:27,134
English version

30
00:01:35,904 --> 00:01:37,904
Your eyebrows are pink.

31
00:01:39,904 --> 00:01:41,904
I'm so happy.

32
00:01:42,904 --> 00:01:44,904
The show will start soon.

33
00:01:44,904 --> 00:01:46,904
Thank you.

36
00:02:10,106 --> 00:02:12,106
I did it!

37
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:15,760
I'm not sure if I can say it.

38
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:16,760
I'm not sure if I can say it.

39
00:02:16,760 --> 00:02:17,760
There are many words.

40
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:18,760
There are many words.

41
00:02:18,760 --> 00:02:20,760
There are many words.

42
00:02:20,760 --> 00:02:22,760
There are more letters than Japanese.

43
00:02:22,760 --> 00:02:26,768
It's like a tongue twister.

44
00:02:27,728 --> 00:02:28,708
That's the point!

45
00:02:28,708 --> 00:02:31,428
Next, we dive in yogurt with brownie
shell and lemon and vão Devil.

46

Everyone is blonde about 4 years

50
00:03:08,234 --> 00:03:16,914
Everyone is going together, everyone
will meet

51
00:03:17,024 --> 00:03:19,024
I did it.

52
00:03:19,024 --> 00:03:21,024
You did it so well.

53
00:03:21,024 --> 00:03:23,024
I could see it.

54
00:03:23,024 --> 00:03:25,024
I could see it.

55
00:03:25,024 --> 00:03:27,024
It was so good.

56
00:03:27,024 --> 00:03:29,024
It was so good.

57
00:03:29,024 --> 00:03:32,024
Thank you.

58
00:03:32,416 --> 00:03:34,416

I'm looking forward to your support.

60
00:03:39,416 --> 00:03:45,416
Thank you for your support with the song

61
00:03:46,416 --> 00:03:47,416
I'll do my best.

Thank you for your viewing.

69
00:04:39,898 --> 00:04:41,898
It's a blue ribbon.

70
00:04:41,898 --> 00:04:42,898
This one?

71
00:04:42,898 --> 00:04:44,898
It's a blue ribbon.

72
00:04:48,898 --> 00:04:50,898
It's so cute.

73
00:04:50,898 --> 00:04:54,800

Thank you!

76
00:05:12,218 --> 00:05:14,218
Hello?

77
00:05:14,224 --> 00:05:16,224
What? No way!

78
00:05:16,224 --> 00:05:18,224
I think it's the same.

79
00:05:23,834 --> 00:05:25,134
It hurts!

80
00:05:28,912 --> 00:05:30,912
I'm not good at all.

81
00:05:30,912 --> 00:05:32,912
I'm not good at all.

82
00:05:32,912 --> 00:05:34,912
I'm not good at all.

83
00:05:34,912 --> 00:05:36,912
I'm not good at all.

84
00:05:38,104 --> 00:05:40,104
My fingers are getting sick.

85
00:05:41,104 --> 00:05:43,104
And the meat here is too thin.

86
00:05:43,104 --> 00:05:46,104
I can't see the bones.

87
00:05:50,464 --> 00:05:52,464
Thank you for watching.

88
00:05:54,054 --> 00:05:57,014
Merry Changi Magenatic!

Thank you for watching!

91
00:06:02,138 --> 00:06:05,200
You see me all the time, my love

92
00:06:05,200 --> 00:06:08,200
It's hard to sing in English.

93
00:06:10,200 --> 00:06:11,200
I got it.

94
00:06:13,200 --> 00:06:14,200
I got the costume for the game.

95
00:06:15,200 --> 00:06:16,200
You always get it there.

96
00:06:16,200 --> 00:06:18,200
There are other costumes.

97
00:06:18,200 --> 00:06:19,200
I got it.

98
00:06:20,200 --> 00:06:21,200
Are you OK?

99
00:06:21,200 --> 00:06:22,200
I got it.

100
00:06:26,200 --> 00:06:28,200

How are you?

104
00:06:37,200 --> 00:06:41,200
Thank you so much for dancing to our
song, Suki.

105
00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:47,200
Suki English version is this on January
30th.

106
00:06:48,200 --> 00:06:49,200
Let's do it again.

107
00:06:50,200 --> 00:06:51,200
It's totally different.

108
00:06:52,200 --> 00:06:54,200
Suki English version.

109
00:06:54,200 --> 00:06:55,200
Thank you!

110
00:06:57,200 --> 00:06:59,200

I'm looking forward to meeting you in
Korea!

115
00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:24,280
What are you doing?

116
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:32,000
Good evening, everyone!

117
00:07:32,186 --> 00:07:39,186
We are wearing an apron.

118
00:07:39,186 --> 00:07:46,186
Today is the day of the cookpad live.

119
00:07:54,186 --> 00:07:58,186
It's our first time to have a camera
here.

120
00:07:58,186 --> 00:08:02,186
Let's do our best.

121
00:08:02,186 --> 00:08:06,186
We are doing a live every month.

122
00:08:06,186 --> 00:08:08,186
We are cooking together.

123
00:08:08,186 --> 00:08:14,186
Today, we are going to make a rice
omelette.

124
00:08:14,186 --> 00:08:16,186
I recommend it.

125
00:08:16,186 --> 00:08:18,186
Do we have more meat?

126
00:08:18,186 --> 00:08:20,186
We have to learn English.

127
00:08:20,186 --> 00:08:22,186
You haven't learned it yet?

128
00:08:22,186 --> 00:08:23,186
What's wrong?

129
00:08:23,186 --> 00:08:27,186
I may have made a mistake.

130
00:08:27,186 --> 00:08:34,186
Today, we are going to make a rice
omelette.

131
00:08:34,186 --> 00:08:36,186
We are going to do our best.

132
00:08:36,186 --> 00:08:40,186
We are going to rehearse.

133
00:08:40,186 --> 00:08:42,186
Please watch us.

134
00:08:42,186 --> 00:08:54,608
We are going to do our best. Please

135
00:08:55,608 --> 00:08:56,608
Don't be afraid.

136
00:09:00,608 --> 00:09:01,608
Don't be afraid.

137
00:09:02,608 --> 00:09:03,608
Don't be afraid to jump.

138
00:09:04,608 --> 00:09:05,608
It looks delicious.

139
00:09:05,608 --> 00:09:06,608
It looks delicious.

140
00:09:06,608 --> 00:09:07,608
It looks delicious.

141
00:09:10,704 --> 00:09:12,704
I can make chicken rice.

142
00:09:12,704 --> 00:09:14,704
I see.

143
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:19,760
It smells good.

144
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:21,760
I'm hungry.

145
00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:23,760
I'm hungry.

146
00:09:27,404 --> 00:09:28,004
Don't endure!!

00:09:40,144 --> 00:09:41,408
Delicious!

150
00:09:41,588 --> 00:09:44,908
Our bento omelette rice is ready to eat.

151
00:09:44,908 --> 00:09:46,908

I love you

163
00:10:44,592 --> 00:10:47,592

It was delicious

166
00:10:49,592 --> 00:10:50,592
It was delicious

167
00:10:50,592 --> 00:10:55,592
We learn a lot of cooking at Cafe
Patrive

168
00:10:55,592 --> 00:10:58,592

Financier

172
00:11:07,592 --> 00:11:09,592
Financier is really delicious

173
00:11:09,592 --> 00:11:10,592

182
00:11:35,482 --> 00:11:43,482
Why is it that when I smile, the world
seems to shine?

183
00:11:43,482 --> 00:11:47,482
I can turn my umbrella around and feel
better

184
00:11:47,482 --> 00:11:51,482
If I don't, I can't walk

185
00:11:51,482 --> 00:11:54,482
I'm sure someone is crying somewhere

186
00:11:54,482 --> 00:12:00,482
I wonder if I'll get wet again somewhere
and not feel cold

187
00:12:00,624 --> 00:12:03,584
There must be someone out there who is
crying

188
00:12:03,584 --> 00:12:08,584
I want to share a little of my feelings
with you

189
00:12:09,104 --> 00:12:13,164
There's still a view I've never seen
before

190
00:12:13,164 --> 00:12:16,604
Come on, let's go anywhere

191
00:12:19,408 --> 00:12:21,448
Goodbye, goodbye

192
00:12:21,448 --> 00:12:23,448
Thank you for yesterday

193
00:12:23,448 --> 00:12:27,608
The city after the rain is colored

194
00:12:27,608 --> 00:12:29,608
On the canvas of my damaged heart

195
00:12:29,608 --> 00:12:31,608
I'll draw a fragment of the future

196
00:12:31,608 --> 00:12:35,168
I hope you can know somewhere

197
00:12:51,674 --> 00:12:56,674
Now I can say it, the reason for my
tears

198
00:12:56,674 --> 00:13:00,674
When I'm lost, I remember it right away

199
00:13:00,674 --> 00:13:04,674
Even if it rains, I'll smile

200
00:13:04,674 --> 00:13:08,674
Look, let's go anywhere

201
00:13:08,674 --> 00:13:12,674
Goodbye, goodbye, to me of yesterday

202
00:13:12,674 --> 00:13:16,674
The city after the rain is sparkling

203
00:13:16,674 --> 00:13:20,674
My heart is like a sunny day, the sound
of the rain drops

204
00:13:20,674 --> 00:13:24,674
I play the rainbow piano

205
00:13:24,674 --> 00:13:29,674
Goodbye, goodbye, to me of yesterday

206
00:13:29,674 --> 00:13:33,674
The city after the rain is sparkling

207
00:13:33,674 --> 00:13:37,674
My heart is like a sunny day, the sound
of the rain drops

208
00:13:37,674 --> 00:13:47,942
I wear a rainbow dress

209
00:13:56,890 --> 00:13:58,890
