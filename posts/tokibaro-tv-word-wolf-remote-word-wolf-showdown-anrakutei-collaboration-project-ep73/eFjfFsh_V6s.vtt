00:00.000 --> 00:06.000
 Everyone, bon bon bon!

00:07.000 --> 00:10.000
 To your heart, rock, rock, rock!

00:10.000 --> 00:13.000
 We are Super! Super! Doki Doki!

00:13.000 --> 00:15.000
 Doki Doki! SNS!

00:15.000 --> 00:17.000
 Please take care of us!

00:17.000 --> 00:19.000
 Thank you!

00:20.200 --> 00:22.200
 Yay!

00:22.200 --> 00:24.200
 Now, it's started!

00:24.200 --> 00:26.200
 Super-exciting promotion!

00:26.200 --> 00:30.200
 Exciting Barometer, Junko TV!

00:30.200 --> 00:34.200
 Yay!

00:34.200 --> 00:37.200
 This week's MC is Julia!

00:37.200 --> 00:38.200
 Please!

00:38.200 --> 00:40.200
 Oh, Julia!

00:40.200 --> 00:42.200
 Was there any MC?

00:42.200 --> 00:43.200
 Right?

00:43.200 --> 00:46.200
 I thought it was like a football.

00:46.200 --> 00:51.200
 This week, we're going to continue with
the birthday special of Kanami.

00:51.200 --> 00:54.200
 We're going to send you a video of her
sister's birthday.

00:54.200 --> 00:57.200
 Yay!

00:57.200 --> 01:00.200
 Thank you for last week!

01:00.200 --> 01:02.200
 Yay!

01:02.200 --> 01:04.200
 I'm glad we succeeded in the surprise.

01:04.200 --> 01:05.200
 Oh!

01:05.200 --> 01:07.200
 I'm glad!

01:07.200 --> 01:09.200
 I'm glad!

01:09.200 --> 01:10.200
 That's great.

01:10.200 --> 01:12.200
 It's really good.

01:12.200 --> 01:13.200
 It feels great.

01:13.200 --> 01:18.200
 I feel like I'm going to fall asleep
when I see this.

01:18.200 --> 01:20.200
 It's so fun.

01:20.200 --> 01:22.200
 Thank you, everyone.

01:22.200 --> 01:25.200
 What are we doing this week?

01:25.200 --> 01:33.200
 This week, we're going to do what
Sudaki-chan, the super-exciting lemon,
wants to do.

01:33.200 --> 01:44.200
 I want to play a war game with everyone
in the team.

01:44.200 --> 01:45.200
 War game!

01:45.200 --> 01:48.200
 That's great.

01:48.200 --> 01:50.200
 The insects won't get hard, will they?

01:50.200 --> 01:53.200
 I'm a little worried.

01:53.200 --> 01:55.200
 I don't care.

01:55.200 --> 02:00.200
 Even if I lose, I don't want you to
quit.

02:00.200 --> 02:03.200
 It was pretty fun.

02:03.200 --> 02:08.200
 I felt sorry for Kanami.

02:08.200 --> 02:10.200
 I'm sorry.

02:10.200 --> 02:30.200
 This program is brought to you by six
people who are working to promote
something exciting.

02:40.200 --> 02:46.816
 Subscribe to our channel here!

02:46.816 --> 02:48.256
 Thank you for watching!

02:48.256 --> 02:51.256
 I'll explain the rules.

02:51.256 --> 02:53.256
 Please explain.

02:53.256 --> 02:57.256
 Each of the six members will be given a
topic.

02:57.256 --> 02:59.256
 Five of the six members will be given
the same topic.

02:59.256 --> 03:03.256
 Only one member will be given a
different topic.

03:03.256 --> 03:07.256
 You can't tell if you're a minority or
a minority.

03:07.256 --> 03:09.256
 You can talk about the topic.

03:09.256 --> 03:14.256
 You can find the minority, the word
rule.

03:14.256 --> 03:27.256
 The word rule is that you have to talk
to the minority.

03:27.256 --> 03:34.256
 If you can find the word rule, you win.

03:34.256 --> 03:40.256
 If you can't find the word rule, you
win.

03:40.256 --> 03:42.256
 Good luck.

03:42.256 --> 03:44.256
 Thank you.

03:44.256 --> 03:46.256
 Good luck.

03:46.256 --> 03:48.256
 Are you a minority?

03:48.256 --> 03:50.256
 I'm a minority.

03:50.256 --> 03:54.176
 The first topic is this.

03:55.176 --> 03:57.176
 Oh, I see.

03:57.176 --> 04:00.176
 I'm getting nervous.

04:00.176 --> 04:02.176
 I'm getting nervous.

04:06.074 --> 04:11.474
 Let's start the meeting time.

04:11.474 --> 04:15.634
 I want to go.

04:15.634 --> 04:20.274
 I want to go.

04:20.274 --> 04:22.274
 I want to go.

04:22.274 --> 04:24.274
 I want to go.

04:24.274 --> 04:26.274
 I want to go.

04:26.274 --> 04:28.274
 I want to go.

04:28.274 --> 04:30.274
 When do you want to go?

04:30.274 --> 04:32.274
 When do you want to enjoy?

04:32.274 --> 04:39.274
 I want to go when I'm in a good mood.

04:39.274 --> 04:41.274
 When I'm in a good mood.

04:41.274 --> 04:43.274
 When everyone is in a good mood.

04:43.274 --> 04:45.274
 When I'm in a good mood.

04:45.274 --> 04:47.274
 When I'm in a good mood.

04:47.274 --> 04:51.274
 I want to go on my day off.

04:51.274 --> 04:53.274
 Who do you want to go with?

04:53.274 --> 04:57.274
 I want to go with a special member.

04:57.274 --> 04:59.274
 I want to go.

04:59.274 --> 05:02.274
 I want to go with a friend.

05:02.274 --> 05:06.274
 I want to go with a friend and family.

05:06.274 --> 05:09.274
 there aren't many.

05:09.274 --> 05:14.274
 We're not short of time.

05:14.274 --> 05:18.274
 We don't have the time.

05:18.274 --> 05:20.274
 When did you go recently?

05:20.274 --> 05:24.274
 I haven't gone at all!

05:24.274 --> 05:26.274
 I haven't been there for about two
years.

05:26.274 --> 05:28.274
 I haven't been there at all.

05:28.274 --> 05:30.274
 One minute left!

05:30.274 --> 05:34.274
 I think I'll be more excited when I was
younger.

05:34.274 --> 05:36.274
 I don't know.

05:36.274 --> 05:42.274
 I used to be excited when I was
younger, but now I'm more excited.

05:42.274 --> 05:44.274
 I think I'll be more excited.

05:44.274 --> 05:46.274
 I think I'll be more excited.

05:46.274 --> 05:48.274
 I don't talk much.

05:48.274 --> 05:53.274
 I don't talk much.

05:53.984 --> 05:54.984
 Karamin!

05:54.984 --> 05:55.984
 Yes!

05:55.984 --> 05:56.984
 Karamin!

05:56.984 --> 05:57.984
 Yes!

05:57.984 --> 05:58.984
 Yes!

05:58.984 --> 05:59.984
 Yes!

05:59.984 --> 06:00.984
 Yes!

06:00.984 --> 06:01.488
 Yes!

06:02.488 --> 06:05.488
 What time do you want to go?

06:05.488 --> 06:07.488
 It's a day off, isn't it?

06:07.488 --> 06:12.488
 I can't go to a day off when I have a
lesson.

06:12.488 --> 06:17.488
 I can't go to a day off when I have a
lesson.

06:17.488 --> 06:19.488
 It's difficult.

06:19.488 --> 06:21.488
 I don't know who it is.

06:21.488 --> 06:22.488
 I don't know.

06:22.488 --> 06:24.488
 I think it's similar.

06:24.488 --> 06:26.488
 It's similar.

06:26.488 --> 06:27.488
 It's fast.

06:27.488 --> 06:30.488
 Let's get rid of the World Wolf.

06:30.488 --> 06:32.488
 I don't know.

06:32.488 --> 06:33.488
 I don't know.

06:33.488 --> 06:34.488
 I don't know.

06:34.488 --> 06:35.488
 I don't know.

06:35.488 --> 06:37.488
 It's the first time.

06:37.488 --> 06:39.488
 It's the first time, so let's try it.

06:39.488 --> 06:40.488
 Let's go.

06:40.488 --> 06:41.488
 One, two.

06:41.488 --> 06:44.488
 Kana-min!

06:44.488 --> 06:46.488
 Julia!

06:46.488 --> 06:47.488
 Five people, Kana-min.

06:47.488 --> 06:49.488
 All of us, Kana-min.

06:49.488 --> 06:50.488
 Aki-chan.

06:50.488 --> 06:51.488
 Aki-chan.

06:51.488 --> 06:57.488
 I thought it was Julia.

06:57.488 --> 06:59.488
 What about Julia?

06:59.488 --> 07:12.488
 I thought it was Kana-min, because I
heard that Hiyarin, Hito-chan, or Haru-
chan said that Kana-min didn't speak.

07:12.488 --> 07:13.488
 I thought it was Kana-min.

07:13.488 --> 07:20.488
 I had the impression that Kana-min was
repeating what someone else said.

07:20.488 --> 07:23.488
 I was repeating what someone else said.

07:23.488 --> 07:33.488
 So, when I heard that everyone wanted
to go together, I said the same thing,
so I was a little behind Kana-min.

07:33.488 --> 07:36.488
 Maybe it's because of that.

07:36.488 --> 07:37.488
 What about you, Tsuji?

07:37.488 --> 07:40.488
 I'm Kana-min intuitively.

07:40.488 --> 07:43.488
 Intuitively.

07:43.488 --> 07:53.488
 I thought it was Kana-min because I
heard the same thing as Hito-chan, just
like Hito-chan.

07:53.488 --> 07:57.488
 Then, let's answer together.

07:57.488 --> 08:00.488
 Let's say our topic together.

08:00.488 --> 08:03.488
 One, two.

08:03.488 --> 08:07.488
 Rope-chan, Julia-chan.

08:07.488 --> 08:08.488
 Julia-chan.

08:08.488 --> 08:18.488
 I'm convinced by what I just heard.

08:18.488 --> 08:22.488
 Was it Hiyarin?

08:22.488 --> 08:24.488
 I don't know.

08:24.488 --> 08:27.488
 I didn't notice it myself.

08:27.488 --> 08:29.488
 I didn't notice it. I thought everyone
was the same.

08:29.488 --> 08:32.488
 It's fun.

08:32.488 --> 08:38.488
 I thought it was a one-shot when I said
I've been on a trip.

08:38.488 --> 08:40.488
 Animal Park.

08:40.488 --> 08:46.488
 But when I said that, I didn't say it
because I thought it was different.

08:46.488 --> 08:49.488
 That's brave.

08:49.488 --> 08:51.488
 It's big.

08:51.488 --> 08:55.488
 I see. Aquarium and Animal Park.

08:55.488 --> 08:58.488
 I didn't notice it.

08:58.488 --> 08:59.488
 I didn't notice it at all.

08:59.488 --> 09:01.488
 Then, Hino and Tachi?

09:01.488 --> 09:04.488
 It's Hino and Tachi.

09:08.144 --> 09:13.144
 I didn't notice it, so I won.

09:13.144 --> 09:18.144
 I don't want to win without being
noticed by victory.

09:18.144 --> 09:22.144
 The five of us are the punishment game.

09:22.144 --> 09:27.144
 Let's have fun.

09:27.144 --> 09:30.144
 What's the first punishment game?

09:30.144 --> 09:40.144
 I want the five of us to imitate cats.

09:40.144 --> 09:45.144
 Let's have fun with everyone's cat.

09:45.144 --> 09:48.144
 Ready, go!

09:48.144 --> 10:08.144
 nya nya nya nya nya nya nya nya...

10:08.144 --> 10:10.144
 Is it a small cat?

10:10.144 --> 10:12.144
 A small cat?

10:12.144 --> 10:14.144
 No!

10:14.144 --> 10:16.144
 No!

10:16.144 --> 10:18.144
 I'm aiming for a cute cat.

10:20.144 --> 10:22.144
 I don't know what time it is.

10:22.144 --> 10:24.144
 Pio-nyan!

10:24.144 --> 10:26.144
 Yes!

10:26.144 --> 10:28.144
 The end!

10:28.144 --> 10:30.144
 I'm sorry. I ended up not touching the
mirror.

10:32.144 --> 10:34.144
 It's okay.

10:34.144 --> 10:36.144
 This punishment game is a little...

10:36.144 --> 10:38.144
 It ended in a wild way.

10:38.144 --> 10:40.144
 What is this?

10:40.144 --> 10:42.144
 This is a very embarrassing house.

10:44.144 --> 10:46.144
 It's true.

10:46.144 --> 10:47.280
 The end!

10:48.280 --> 10:50.280
 Let's move on to the second question!

10:53.280 --> 10:55.280
 Let's wait for the topic.

10:57.280 --> 10:59.280
 It's better to listen to it a little
more.

10:59.280 --> 11:01.280
 Let's do a one-time round.

11:01.280 --> 11:03.280
 Let's do a screenshot time while we're
waiting.

11:03.280 --> 11:05.280
 Screenshot time!

11:05.280 --> 11:16.280
 Thank you for watching!

11:16.506 --> 11:19.246
 I'm assuming...

11:27.802 --> 11:34.802
 Let's move on to the second question.

11:34.802 --> 11:36.802
 Do you like the taste?

11:36.802 --> 11:39.802
 I like it. I drank it today.

11:39.802 --> 11:42.802
 Oh, that's good.

11:42.802 --> 11:45.802
 I like it, but I want to drink it in
the season.

11:45.802 --> 11:47.802
 I understand.

11:47.802 --> 11:52.688
 I want to drink it when it's hot.

11:53.688 --> 11:54.688
 What is it?

11:54.688 --> 11:55.688
 A question.

11:55.688 --> 11:56.688
 A question.

11:56.688 --> 11:58.688
 I'll ask you a question.

11:58.688 --> 12:04.688
 Is it a drink made of fruit?

12:04.688 --> 12:05.688
 Yes.

12:05.688 --> 12:07.584
 Yes.

12:08.584 --> 12:10.584
 Fruit?

12:10.584 --> 12:11.584
 Yes.

12:11.584 --> 12:12.584
 It's difficult.

12:12.584 --> 12:13.584
 Yes.

12:13.584 --> 12:17.584
 Do you like that drink a lot?

12:17.584 --> 12:18.584
 Yes.

12:18.584 --> 12:19.584
 I think so.

12:19.584 --> 12:21.584
 Is it a lot?

12:21.584 --> 12:23.584
 I think so.

12:23.584 --> 12:25.584
 Is it a lot?

12:25.584 --> 12:29.584
 But I don't have many.

12:29.584 --> 12:31.584
 Do you have it at home?

12:31.584 --> 12:33.056
 I have it at home.

12:34.056 --> 12:36.056
 I don't have it now.

12:36.056 --> 12:38.056
 I have it.

12:38.056 --> 12:40.056
 You have it?

12:40.056 --> 12:41.056
 Oh?

12:41.056 --> 12:43.056
 How is it?

12:44.056 --> 12:46.056
 I bought it, so I have it.

12:46.056 --> 12:48.056
 You bought it?

12:48.056 --> 12:50.056
 Where did you buy it?

12:50.056 --> 12:52.056
 I put it in the refrigerator.

12:54.056 --> 12:55.056
 I don't know.

12:55.056 --> 12:57.056
 Did you buy it from your mom?

12:57.056 --> 12:59.056
 I bought it from a lot of places.

12:59.056 --> 13:01.056
 Do you sell it at the vending machine?

13:01.056 --> 13:03.056
 I heard that.

13:03.072 --> 13:07.712
 What color is the juice if you compare
it to one color?

13:07.712 --> 13:09.712
 That's a good question.

13:09.712 --> 13:11.712
 You'll find out.

13:11.712 --> 13:13.712
 You'll find out.

13:13.712 --> 13:15.712
 I think 100% is better.

13:15.712 --> 13:17.712
 I think 100% is better.

13:17.712 --> 13:19.712
 I agree.

13:19.712 --> 13:21.712
 Do you guys drink it often?

13:21.712 --> 13:23.712
 I don't drink it often.

13:23.712 --> 13:25.712
 I don't drink it often.

13:25.712 --> 13:27.712
 I used to drink it at the concert.

13:27.712 --> 13:29.712
 I used to drink it at the concert.

13:29.712 --> 13:31.712
 I used to drink it at the concert.

13:31.712 --> 13:32.048
 I used to drink it at the concert.

13:33.048 --> 13:34.048
 I had it.

13:34.048 --> 13:35.048
 I had it.

13:35.048 --> 13:37.048
 I see.

13:38.048 --> 13:40.048
 It's over.

13:41.048 --> 13:42.048
 It's over.

13:42.048 --> 13:43.048
 It's over.

13:45.048 --> 13:46.048
 Who is it?

13:47.048 --> 13:48.048
 One, two, three.

13:49.048 --> 13:50.048
 It's Julia.

13:52.048 --> 13:53.048
 Julia's person.

13:54.048 --> 13:55.048
 Julia.

13:55.048 --> 13:57.280
 One, two, three.

13:58.280 --> 14:00.280
 I chose Kanamin.

14:02.280 --> 14:06.280
 Do you drink that much?

14:07.280 --> 14:09.280
 I remember that.

14:10.280 --> 14:13.280
 I don't have much.

14:15.280 --> 14:17.280
 Takai doesn't drink that much.

14:17.280 --> 14:23.280
 I thought Julia's opinion was different
from everyone else's.

14:24.856 --> 14:27.856
 That's why I chose Julia.

14:27.856 --> 14:33.856
 When I asked if you could tell if you
liked or disliked something,

14:33.856 --> 14:38.856
 I thought you couldn't tell that much.

14:38.856 --> 14:43.856
 But Julia said, I think I can tell.

14:43.856 --> 14:47.856
 You can't tell that much, can you?

14:47.856 --> 14:49.856
 I don't think so.

14:49.856 --> 14:51.856
 You don't, do you?

14:51.856 --> 14:53.136
 I don't think so.

14:54.136 --> 15:00.136
 I think it's a little different from
the topic I'm on.

15:01.136 --> 15:03.136
 That's right. I think so too.

15:04.136 --> 15:05.136
 What about Julia?

15:06.136 --> 15:07.136
 Julia is...

15:07.136 --> 15:08.136
 A can?

15:12.136 --> 15:13.136
 I have no reason.

15:14.136 --> 15:17.136
 I'm on the wrong side, so I can't
focus.

15:17.136 --> 15:25.136
 I don't know why, but I felt like I was
saying, huh?

15:26.136 --> 15:29.136
 It was for Julia, so it might be Julia.

15:30.136 --> 15:33.136
 If it's a plural, it's Julia.

15:34.136 --> 15:37.136
 Let's ask Julia a question.

15:38.136 --> 15:40.136
 Let's say your topic at the same time.

15:40.136 --> 15:41.136
 Let's go.

15:44.136 --> 15:46.136
 Lemon juice.

15:47.136 --> 15:48.136
 I got it.

15:49.136 --> 15:50.136
 I knew this person.

15:50.136 --> 15:51.136
 Was it you?

15:59.136 --> 16:00.136
 Wait a minute.

16:00.136 --> 16:02.136
 100% orange.

16:04.136 --> 16:07.136
 Didn't you ask me if I wanted 100%
orange?

16:07.136 --> 16:11.136
 I thought you wanted 100%.

16:12.136 --> 16:14.136
 I thought you wanted to go to Hiei.

16:15.136 --> 16:17.136
 I thought it was me.

16:19.136 --> 16:21.136
 I thought it was me.

16:21.136 --> 16:22.136
 I don't like it.

16:23.136 --> 16:24.136
 I thought it was me.

16:25.136 --> 16:26.136
 I can understand.

16:27.136 --> 16:31.136
 I've never seen a lemon juice in a live
house box.

16:33.136 --> 16:34.136
 I imagined that.

16:34.136 --> 16:41.136
 I made a lemon juice drink at the Tokyo
Idol Festival.

16:43.136 --> 16:44.136
 I imagined that.

16:45.136 --> 16:46.136
 I imagined that.

16:47.136 --> 16:49.136
 I thought it was a box shot.

16:50.136 --> 16:51.136
 I thought it was 100%.

16:52.136 --> 16:53.136
 I told you.

16:55.136 --> 16:58.136
 I can't drink 100% lemon juice.

16:59.136 --> 17:00.136
 I was sure.

17:00.136 --> 17:05.136
 I thought it was a lemon juice.

17:06.136 --> 17:07.136
 I thought it was a lemon juice.

17:08.136 --> 17:09.136
 I thought it was a lemon juice.

17:09.136 --> 17:11.632
 I thought it was 100% orange.

17:12.632 --> 17:13.632
 I see.

17:13.632 --> 17:15.632
 Did you know?

17:15.632 --> 17:23.632
 I thought it was a song by Tokichi-san,
but it was a topic that was often
discussed at home.

17:23.632 --> 17:25.632
 I thought it was different.

17:27.632 --> 17:28.632
 I'm not wrong.

17:28.632 --> 17:33.632
 I thought it was a song by Tokichi-san,
but it was a topic that was often
discussed at home.

17:33.632 --> 17:35.632
 I thought it was different.

17:35.632 --> 17:37.632
 I said it before I said it.

17:37.632 --> 17:39.632
 I said it to Calbee.

17:39.632 --> 17:43.632
 I thought it was a topic of orange
juice, so I talked about it.

17:45.632 --> 17:50.632
 That's why there's orange juice in the
box.

17:50.632 --> 17:52.632
 That's right.

17:53.632 --> 17:55.632
 So I said it to Calbee.

18:00.632 --> 18:01.632
 I'm sorry.

18:01.632 --> 18:03.632
 I'm sorry.

18:03.632 --> 18:05.632
 I'm sorry.

18:05.632 --> 18:06.632
 I'm sorry.

18:06.632 --> 18:09.632
 I'll count 30 seconds.

18:09.632 --> 18:10.632
 Yes.

18:10.632 --> 18:15.632
 Ready, start!

18:18.632 --> 18:19.632
 It's cute.

18:21.632 --> 18:22.632
 It's like a child.

18:22.632 --> 18:26.632
 It's like a child.

18:26.632 --> 18:35.696
 Please subscribe to the channel.

18:36.696 --> 18:38.696
 Isn't it too long?

18:38.696 --> 18:40.696
 It's a little bit long.

18:40.696 --> 18:42.696
 It's a little bit long.

18:42.696 --> 18:44.696
 It's a little bit long.

18:44.696 --> 18:48.048
 Thank you for watching.

19:17.072 --> 19:19.072
 What is this?

19:19.072 --> 19:21.072
 It sounds like a family.

19:21.072 --> 19:23.072
 What is this?

19:23.072 --> 19:25.072
 It was the best.

19:25.072 --> 19:27.072
 What was the atmosphere?

19:27.072 --> 19:31.072
 It was very lively.

19:31.072 --> 19:33.072
 I'm talking about chicken.

19:33.072 --> 19:37.072
 I want to win this time.

19:37.072 --> 19:39.072
 I want to win.

19:39.072 --> 19:41.072
 I want to win the third time.

19:41.072 --> 19:44.512
 Good evening, everyone.

19:45.512 --> 19:49.512
 We are Joun! Tokimeki Sendemu.

19:49.512 --> 19:51.512
 Thank you for your support.

19:55.512 --> 20:12.512
 Until June 14th, we will be in Yakiniku
restaurant Anrakutei, Enraku,
Kichirinbo, Steak Don, Shabu-Shabu
Dontei,

20:12.512 --> 20:17.512
 and Forks, which are 6 different
brands.

20:17.512 --> 20:20.512
 We are having a collaboration fair.

20:20.512 --> 20:26.512
 We would like to eat the lunch box.

20:28.512 --> 20:30.512
 It's the best.

20:30.512 --> 20:31.512
 It's wonderful.

20:31.512 --> 20:46.512
 We are going to eat the lunch box of 4
brands, Anrakutei, Shabu-Shabu Dontei,
Kichirinbo, and Forks.

20:46.512 --> 20:48.512
 Are you ready?

20:48.512 --> 20:49.512
 Yes.

20:49.512 --> 20:55.512
 I'm going to eat the lunch box of
Anrakutei.

20:55.512 --> 20:57.512
 I'm so excited.

20:57.512 --> 21:00.512
 I'm going to eat this for the first
time.

21:00.512 --> 21:01.512
 It's delicious.

21:01.512 --> 21:03.512
 I'm going to eat the second one.

21:03.512 --> 21:06.512
 I'm going to eat the third one.

21:08.512 --> 21:09.512
 I'm going to open it.

21:09.512 --> 21:13.200
 I'm going to eat the fourth one.

21:14.200 --> 21:16.200
 It's like a bibimbap.

21:16.200 --> 21:18.200
 It's like a bibimbap.

21:18.200 --> 21:19.200
 I'm surprised.

21:19.200 --> 21:21.200
 You can tell without looking at it.

21:23.200 --> 21:24.200
 I'll eat it.

21:24.200 --> 21:35.098
 Please subscribe to our channel.

21:35.098 --> 21:36.098
 Hmm...

21:36.098 --> 21:38.098
 LOL

21:39.098 --> 21:40.098
 Hmm...

21:40.098 --> 21:41.098
 How is it?

21:41.098 --> 21:42.098
 No, well...

21:42.098 --> 21:43.872
 LOL

21:44.372 --> 21:51.372
 The meat is thick, so I'm satisfied
with just one piece.

21:52.372 --> 21:55.372
 The meat is tender, so it's easy to
eat.

21:55.872 --> 22:03.372
 The sweetness of the sauce and the
sweetness of the meat go well together,
and I'm happy in my mouth.

22:04.372 --> 22:06.872
 It's delicious! It's the best!

22:06.872 --> 22:12.872
 Next, I'd like to eat the super rock
lunch box of Unlock P.

22:13.872 --> 22:15.872
 It's a special version! It's a gorgeous
one!

22:16.372 --> 22:17.872
 Haruka is aiming for it.

22:18.872 --> 22:20.872
 This is good! This is good!

22:21.872 --> 22:23.872
 I'll eat it!

22:23.872 --> 22:30.872
 It's a beef tongue!

22:32.442 --> 22:36.442
 It's so good! I'm so happy!

22:39.442 --> 22:41.442
 It's so juicy!

22:44.442 --> 22:47.442
 I can feel the meat inside.

22:48.442 --> 22:49.442
 It's so good.

22:50.442 --> 22:52.442
 I love Namul's rice.

22:54.442 --> 22:58.442
 It's so good that I don't need anything
else.

22:59.442 --> 23:00.442
 It's amazing.

23:00.442 --> 23:01.442
 Thank you.

23:04.442 --> 23:10.442
 I'm going to have Shichirinbo's roast
soy sauce bento.

23:11.442 --> 23:13.442
 I can tell by the name that it's going
to be good.

23:13.442 --> 23:14.442
 It's the best.

23:14.442 --> 23:23.442
 Please subscribe to this channel.

23:24.616 --> 23:28.616
 I'm going to put on lipstick.

23:28.616 --> 23:48.616
 I'm going to put on lipstick.

23:50.554 --> 23:52.554
 Good job!

23:52.554 --> 24:04.128
 Thank you for watching!

24:04.128 --> 24:06.128
 The winner is...

24:06.128 --> 24:08.128
 It's here!

24:08.128 --> 24:12.128
 The meat is well seasoned.

24:12.128 --> 24:17.128
 There are so many big pieces of meat.

24:17.128 --> 24:22.128
 I think the meat alone is enough.

24:22.128 --> 24:29.128
 But the fat makes it more special.

24:29.128 --> 24:31.128
 It's so good.

24:31.128 --> 24:36.128
 The rice is covered with Korean
seaweed.

24:36.128 --> 24:39.128
 It's more luxurious.

24:39.128 --> 24:42.128
 Thank you so much.

24:42.128 --> 24:45.128
 Thank you for the meal.

24:45.128 --> 24:49.128
 Let's move on to the second lunch!

24:49.128 --> 24:51.128
 The second round.

24:51.128 --> 24:57.128
 This is the best lunch of 7 people.

24:57.128 --> 24:59.128
 The best!

24:59.128 --> 25:01.128
 The second round.

25:01.128 --> 25:04.128
 The second round.

25:04.128 --> 25:06.128
 It's hot.

25:09.720 --> 25:10.720
 It's amazing.

25:10.720 --> 25:12.720
 The flavor is coming out.

25:20.720 --> 25:21.720
 It's luxurious.

25:22.720 --> 25:23.720
 Let's eat.

25:23.720 --> 25:24.720
 It's hot.

25:24.720 --> 25:35.720
 I'm going to eat this.

25:37.720 --> 25:38.720
 It's delicious!

25:40.720 --> 25:43.720
 The sauce of the meat is quite strong.

25:44.720 --> 25:50.720
 But, the addition of the tororo adds a
mild taste.

25:50.720 --> 25:52.720
 And, the green onion's flavor is also
good.

25:52.720 --> 25:57.720
 And, there is a plum in it, so you can
eat it refreshingly.

25:58.720 --> 25:59.720
 It's good for summer.

26:00.720 --> 26:01.720
 It's perfect now.

26:01.720 --> 26:04.720
 It's delicious. Thank you.

26:06.720 --> 26:15.720
 I'm going to eat the beef sukiyaki
bento of Shabu-Shabu's Dontei.

26:15.720 --> 26:16.720
 I ate it.

26:16.720 --> 26:17.720
 It's sukiyaki.

26:17.720 --> 26:20.720
 I ate the sukiyaki bento.

26:20.720 --> 26:23.720
 I'm going to eat this.

26:27.610 --> 26:29.610
 Delicious!

26:33.328 --> 26:35.328
 It's really soaked in.

26:37.328 --> 26:39.328
 The meat is really soft.

26:39.328 --> 26:41.328
 It's really delicious.

26:41.328 --> 26:43.328
 Yes, then.

26:43.328 --> 26:45.328
 Finally.

26:45.328 --> 26:47.328
 Forks.

26:47.328 --> 26:49.328
 Forks.

26:49.328 --> 26:51.328
 Double cheese hamburger bento.

26:51.328 --> 26:53.328
 I'd like to have it.

26:55.328 --> 26:57.328
 I'm looking forward to it.

26:57.328 --> 26:59.328
 It's a bomb.

26:59.328 --> 27:03.328
 I thought there was a hamburger here.

27:03.328 --> 27:05.328
 But it was in front of me.

27:05.328 --> 27:07.328
 It's delicious.

27:09.080 --> 27:15.080
 Look! There is cheese inside.

27:15.080 --> 27:20.080
 The outside and the most delicious
part.

27:20.080 --> 27:38.080
 Look! The cheese is delicious.

27:40.922 --> 27:42.922
 Please subscribe to our channel!

27:44.640 --> 28:02.640
 The cheese inside is creamy and the
meat is spread in my mouth.

28:02.640 --> 28:05.640
 The two layers of cheese are amazing.

28:05.640 --> 28:10.640
 The sauce is also delicious.

28:10.640 --> 28:17.640
 This is delicious.

28:17.640 --> 28:25.640
 We enjoyed this meal.

28:25.640 --> 28:32.640
 This is the best collaboration lunch
box.

28:32.640 --> 28:37.640
 I have an announcement.

28:37.640 --> 28:51.640
 The collaboration between Yakiniku
Restaurant Anrakutei, Enraku and Shabu-
Shabu's Dontei will be extended.

28:51.640 --> 28:53.640
 The collaboration period will be
extended.

28:53.640 --> 28:56.640
 Thank you very much.

28:56.640 --> 28:57.640
 I'm glad.

28:57.640 --> 28:59.640
 We can still make it.

28:59.640 --> 29:05.640
 There are many people who are hungry
now.

29:05.640 --> 29:09.640
 Please check the website.

29:09.640 --> 29:11.640
 Please go to eat.

29:11.640 --> 29:13.640
 Please eat.

29:13.640 --> 29:14.640
 Please eat.

29:14.640 --> 29:17.640
 You can also get this poster.

29:17.640 --> 29:19.640
 Please check it.

29:19.640 --> 29:20.640
 It's amazing.

29:20.640 --> 29:23.640
 I'm really tired.

29:23.640 --> 29:25.640
 I ate about 20 pieces.

29:25.640 --> 29:32.640
 Please eat a lot.

29:33.978 --> 29:35.978
 Well, let's get started.

29:35.978 --> 29:37.978
 Please.

29:42.682 --> 29:43.722
 You have to...

29:44.242 --> 29:45.162
 What?

29:45.982 --> 29:47.042
 He did it.

29:57.522 --> 29:58.522
 All right

29:58.522 --> 29:59.522
 Start!

29:59.968 --> 30:02.968
 I think this is the last one.

30:02.968 --> 30:04.968
 I think it's interesting.

30:04.968 --> 30:05.968
 I see.

30:05.968 --> 30:08.968
 I felt like this.

30:08.968 --> 30:10.968
 It's cute.

30:10.968 --> 30:11.968
 I think it's cute.

30:11.968 --> 30:13.968
 It's so cute.

30:13.968 --> 30:16.968
 It's overflowing with cuteness.

30:16.968 --> 30:18.968
 It's so fluffy.

30:18.968 --> 30:20.968
 Fluffy.

30:20.968 --> 30:21.968
 Fluffy.

30:21.968 --> 30:23.968
 Soft.

30:23.968 --> 30:24.968
 Soft.

30:24.968 --> 30:25.968
 Soft.

30:25.968 --> 30:26.968
 Cute.

30:26.968 --> 30:27.968
 What do you think, Kanami?

30:27.968 --> 30:30.968
 It's like a minus ion.

30:30.968 --> 30:33.968
 Like this.

30:33.968 --> 30:35.968
 What about you, Kanami?

30:35.968 --> 30:38.968
 I think it's a hyphen.

30:38.968 --> 30:39.968
 What?

30:39.968 --> 30:40.968
 Hyphen?

30:40.968 --> 30:41.968
 Hyphen?

30:41.968 --> 30:45.968
 What's your image color?

30:45.968 --> 30:46.968
 Image?

30:46.968 --> 30:48.968
 I'm imagining it.

30:48.968 --> 30:49.968
 I'm imagining it.

30:49.968 --> 30:50.968
 I'm imagining it.

30:50.968 --> 30:51.968
 I'm imagining it.

30:51.968 --> 30:52.968
 I'm imagining it.

30:52.968 --> 30:53.968
 I'm imagining it.

30:53.968 --> 30:54.968
 I'm imagining it.

30:54.968 --> 30:55.968
 I'm imagining it.

30:55.968 --> 30:58.968
 You're imagining it?

30:58.968 --> 30:59.968
 What?

30:59.968 --> 31:00.968
 You're imagining it?

31:00.968 --> 31:02.968
 I'm imagining it.

31:02.968 --> 31:07.504
 Green?

31:07.504 --> 31:09.504
 Hmm...

31:09.504 --> 31:11.504
 It's like...

31:11.504 --> 31:13.504
 It's like a cream color.

31:13.504 --> 31:15.504
 It's warm.

31:15.504 --> 31:17.504
 Yeah.

31:17.504 --> 31:19.504
 It's a warm color.

31:19.504 --> 31:21.504
 But it's thin.

31:22.504 --> 31:24.504
 Ah, but...

31:24.504 --> 31:26.504
 Huh?

31:26.504 --> 31:28.504
 What's cream?

31:28.504 --> 31:30.504
 It's a cream.

31:32.088 --> 31:34.088
 She's laughing so much.

31:36.088 --> 31:37.088
 What about Julia?

31:37.088 --> 31:38.088
 She's cute.

31:39.088 --> 31:41.088
 When I look at her, I feel like I'm
going to faint.

31:42.088 --> 31:43.088
 The color is cream.

31:43.088 --> 31:44.088
 It's soothing.

31:44.088 --> 31:46.088
 I like it.

31:46.088 --> 31:47.088
 I want one.

31:48.088 --> 31:49.088
 I want one.

31:49.088 --> 31:50.088
 I want one.

31:50.088 --> 31:51.088
 I want one.

31:51.088 --> 31:52.088
 I want one.

31:52.088 --> 31:53.088
 One.

31:54.088 --> 31:55.088
 Is that a thing?

31:55.088 --> 31:56.088
 Yes.

31:56.088 --> 31:57.088
 Is it a person?

31:57.088 --> 31:58.088
 It's not a thing.

31:58.088 --> 31:59.088
 It's not a thing, is it?

31:59.088 --> 32:00.088
 It's not a thing.

32:00.088 --> 32:01.088
 I'm in a trance.

32:01.088 --> 32:02.088
 I'm in a trance.

32:02.088 --> 32:03.088
 What?

32:03.088 --> 32:04.088
 Wait a minute.

32:05.088 --> 32:10.088
 When do you think of that person?

32:10.088 --> 32:12.088
 I thought of it the other day.

32:12.088 --> 32:13.088
 I thought of it the other day.

32:13.088 --> 32:14.088
 I thought of it the other day.

32:14.088 --> 32:15.088
 I thought of it the other day.

32:15.088 --> 32:16.088
 I thought of it the other day.

32:17.088 --> 32:18.088
 End.

32:18.088 --> 32:19.088
 What's this conversation?

32:19.088 --> 32:20.096
 Thank you for watching.

32:21.096 --> 32:23.096
 I think I understand. I decided.

32:23.096 --> 32:25.096
 I decided, too.

32:25.096 --> 32:27.096
 I decided, too.

32:27.096 --> 32:31.096
 Let's say who we think it is.

32:31.096 --> 32:33.096
 Ready? Go!

32:34.392 --> 32:35.392
 Kanamin!

32:35.392 --> 32:36.392
 Kanamin!

32:36.392 --> 32:37.392
 The person who wrote Kanamin!

32:37.392 --> 32:38.392
 The person who wrote Kanamin!

32:38.392 --> 32:39.392
 Kanamin!

32:39.392 --> 32:40.392
 Aki-chan!

32:40.392 --> 32:41.392
 Aki-chan!

32:41.392 --> 32:42.392
 Oh my!

32:42.392 --> 32:48.392
 If it's an answer that Hiyori knows,
it's hard to answer.

32:48.392 --> 32:49.392
 Yeah.

32:49.392 --> 32:52.392
 I can't answer either.

32:52.392 --> 32:53.392
 I wonder if it's a little hard.

32:53.392 --> 32:59.392
 It's weird!

33:00.144 --> 33:01.144
 Right?

33:03.264 --> 33:07.144
 Why did you choose green?

33:07.144 --> 33:10.144
 When you said green, I thought it was
green.

33:13.144 --> 33:15.144
 It's not green.

33:15.144 --> 33:18.144
 I thought it wasn't green.

33:18.144 --> 33:20.144
 I thought so, too.

33:24.144 --> 33:25.144
 Wait a minute.

33:25.144 --> 33:27.144
 It's green!

33:27.144 --> 33:28.768
 It's really green.

33:29.768 --> 33:39.768
 I thought you were supporting Wolf.

33:39.768 --> 33:41.768
 I see.

33:41.768 --> 33:46.768
 Everyone's image color is different.

33:46.768 --> 33:47.768
 It's different.

33:47.768 --> 33:49.768
 I'm intuitively.

33:49.768 --> 33:51.768
 This is Kanamin.

33:51.768 --> 33:53.768
 No, it's not.

33:53.768 --> 33:54.768
 Wait a minute.

33:54.768 --> 33:57.296
 Wait a minute. Can I ask you another
question?

33:57.296 --> 34:02.296
 What do you think about us saying that
you're cute?

34:03.296 --> 34:05.296
 I couldn't say anything.

34:06.296 --> 34:07.296
 What do you think?

34:07.296 --> 34:08.296
 I don't know.

34:08.296 --> 34:10.296
 I said you're cute.

34:11.296 --> 34:14.296
 Do you think so?

34:14.296 --> 34:16.296
 If you don't think so,

34:16.296 --> 34:19.296
 I don't think so, but thank you.

34:21.296 --> 34:22.296
 I can't do that.

34:22.296 --> 34:24.296
 I can't do that.

34:24.296 --> 34:25.296
 I can't do that.

34:25.296 --> 34:26.384
 I'm a wolf.

34:27.384 --> 34:29.384
 I know what the answer is.

34:29.384 --> 34:31.384
 I've heard too much.

34:35.384 --> 34:37.384
 We have to win.

34:37.384 --> 34:39.384
 Wait a minute.

34:39.384 --> 34:41.384
 Wait a minute.

34:41.384 --> 34:43.384
 Wait a minute.

34:43.384 --> 34:45.384
 I don't know if I can take it.

34:45.384 --> 34:49.384
 And I'm afraid of playing a punishment
game.

34:49.384 --> 34:51.384
 Wait a minute.

34:51.384 --> 34:53.384
 Aki-chan, too.

34:53.384 --> 34:55.384
 I'm worried.

34:57.176 --> 34:59.176
 Everyone already knows the answer.

35:00.176 --> 35:02.176
 Aki-chan is cute.

35:02.176 --> 35:13.520
 I thought my answer was different.

35:14.520 --> 35:16.520
 I answered first.

35:17.520 --> 35:19.520
 I answered first.

35:20.520 --> 35:22.520
 I answered first.

35:23.520 --> 35:25.520
 I might have known.

35:26.520 --> 35:28.520
 I was confused.

35:29.520 --> 35:31.520
 Let's take a picture of the tattoo.

35:34.520 --> 35:36.520
 I'm really different.

35:36.520 --> 35:38.520
 I'm different.

35:38.520 --> 35:40.520
 I'm not a wolf.

35:40.520 --> 35:43.408
 I'm a person who thinks I'm a wolf.

35:43.408 --> 35:46.408
 I'm a person who thinks I'm a wolf.

36:05.648 --> 36:13.648
 I thought it was Hiyori.

36:13.648 --> 36:17.648
 But you don't say you're cute, do you?

36:17.648 --> 36:21.648
 I wonder if I'll say it if it's Hiyori.

36:21.648 --> 36:27.648
 I don't want to say it.

36:27.648 --> 36:31.648
 The last question was interesting.

36:31.648 --> 36:37.648
 I got it right.

36:37.648 --> 36:41.056
 What is it?

36:42.056 --> 36:44.056
 You're so mean!

36:46.056 --> 36:48.056
 So we're not supposed to laugh, right?

36:48.056 --> 36:49.056
 Okay.

36:50.056 --> 36:52.056
 Like that show where we don't laugh.

36:58.056 --> 37:00.056
 I'm going to fall.

37:01.056 --> 37:03.056
 Let's do it seriously.

37:03.056 --> 37:05.056
 Let's do it seriously.

37:06.056 --> 37:08.056
 I'll do it seriously.

37:08.056 --> 37:11.056
 I'll do my best.

37:11.684 --> 37:12.684
 Are you ready?

37:12.684 --> 37:13.684
 Ready!

37:13.684 --> 37:14.684
 Start!

37:23.322 --> 37:25.322
 I'm sorry.

37:27.322 --> 37:29.322
 No, no, no, the camera!

37:29.322 --> 37:31.322
 The camera!

37:35.322 --> 37:37.322
 Did you get it?

37:37.322 --> 37:45.882
 Bye!

37:45.882 --> 37:47.882
 I'll imitate Doraemon.

37:47.882 --> 38:07.882
 I'll imitate Mario.

38:09.384 --> 38:12.384
 I'm done!

38:12.384 --> 38:15.384
 I'm done!

38:15.384 --> 38:21.384
 I thought you'd laugh at me if I
laughed.

38:21.384 --> 38:24.384
 I was laughed at in the first second.

38:24.384 --> 38:28.384
 I did my best.

38:28.384 --> 38:29.384
 I did my best.

38:29.384 --> 38:30.384
 Applause.

38:30.384 --> 38:32.384
 It was amazing.

38:32.384 --> 38:33.384
 I'm Misuga.

38:33.384 --> 38:35.384
 It's fun to play World of Warcraft.

38:35.384 --> 38:36.384
 It was fun.

38:36.384 --> 38:37.328
 I'm Misuga.

38:37.328 --> 38:40.828
 It would be fun if we all played World
Wolf together.

38:40.828 --> 38:46.328
 I'm looking forward to it.

38:46.328 --> 38:49.328
 It was a fun time.

38:49.328 --> 38:51.328
 Thank you all.

38:51.328 --> 38:54.328
 Aki's dream came true.

38:54.328 --> 38:57.328
 It was fun.

38:57.328 --> 39:00.328
 Is there a game you want to play next?

39:00.328 --> 39:05.328
 I want to play an insider game or an
episode of Jindo.

39:05.328 --> 39:05.392
 Please subscribe to my channel.

39:05.392 --> 39:06.392
 It's like...

39:06.392 --> 39:07.392
 It's like...

39:07.392 --> 39:09.392
 It's like the same thing, but...

39:09.392 --> 39:12.392
 There's an interesting game.

39:12.392 --> 39:14.392
 I want to play Jindo.

39:14.392 --> 39:15.392
 I want to play Jindo!

39:15.392 --> 39:16.392
 I want to play Jindo!

39:16.392 --> 39:18.392
 I want to play that!

39:18.392 --> 39:21.392
 It's like a game where you connect the
lyrics.

39:21.392 --> 39:22.392
 That's hard!

39:22.392 --> 39:23.392
 For example...

39:23.392 --> 39:24.392
 If you say,

39:24.392 --> 39:27.392
 If you say, 「がんばってがんばって言えたのは」

39:27.392 --> 39:30.392
 Someone will sing the lyrics that start
with 「は」

39:30.392 --> 39:30.528
 Someone will sing the lyrics that start
with 「は」

39:31.528 --> 39:33.528
 わくわく

39:33.528 --> 39:36.528
 わくわく妄想プールデート

39:36.528 --> 39:38.528
 妄想プールデート

39:38.528 --> 39:40.528
 「と」で終わったから

39:40.528 --> 39:44.528
 「と」で始まるときめきわくわく止まらない

39:44.528 --> 39:45.528
 で、「い」から

39:45.528 --> 39:46.528
 いくぜ!いくぜ!いくぜ!

39:46.528 --> 39:48.528
 あ、また妄想プールデート

39:48.528 --> 39:50.528
 すごい!

39:50.528 --> 39:52.528
 そう、こういう、これやりたいんだよね

39:52.528 --> 39:54.528
 これならさ、できるよね

39:54.528 --> 39:56.528
 できるね

39:56.528 --> 39:58.352
 これやりたい

39:58.352 --> 39:59.352
 It looks fun.

39:59.352 --> 40:01.352
 I can enjoy the music too.

40:01.352 --> 40:03.536
 Oh, the Ohio Valley didn't stop this
time.

40:04.536 --> 40:06.536
 That's great.

40:11.536 --> 40:16.536
 That's all for the Bird Wolf Game.

40:18.536 --> 40:20.536
 It was fun.

40:20.536 --> 40:33.536
 Thank you for watching.

40:33.664 --> 40:35.664
 Thank you for watching.

40:35.664 --> 40:37.664
 Bye-bye.

40:40.464 --> 40:42.464
 Daikyo setsu.

40:42.464 --> 40:44.464
 Setsu.

40:44.464 --> 40:53.850
 Oh, I'm a fan!

40:53.850 --> 41:05.850
 Please subscribe to my channel!

41:06.234 --> 41:08.834
 This life that has no choice but to
keep opening

41:08.834 --> 41:11.534
 It should be very fun, right?

41:11.534 --> 41:14.334
 I always believe in the future

41:14.334 --> 41:18.534
 I don't have to expect anything

41:18.534 --> 41:19.534
 It's good!

41:19.534 --> 41:20.034
 Let's go!

41:20.034 --> 41:21.034
 Tumo Tumo Tumo!

41:21.034 --> 41:21.534
 No!

41:21.534 --> 41:22.234
 The strongest set!

41:22.234 --> 41:23.934
 To the new me
