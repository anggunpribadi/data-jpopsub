00:00.000 --> 00:04.000
 I'm going to appear in a TV commercial
for Abe-Katsu Motors.

00:04.000 --> 00:07.000
 Abe-Katsu is a big company.

00:07.000 --> 00:08.000
 I knew it.

00:09.000 --> 00:10.000
 That's it.

00:10.000 --> 00:15.248
 That's it.

00:16.248 --> 00:18.248
 Good morning.

00:19.248 --> 00:21.248
 It's a nice day.

00:22.248 --> 00:24.248
 I'm going to show my inner self.

00:25.248 --> 00:31.248
 I've been thinking that many people
know about you.

00:32.248 --> 00:34.248
 What kind of episode is it?

00:35.248 --> 00:37.248
 I'm curious.

00:39.248 --> 00:40.248
 You want to be filmed?

00:40.248 --> 00:42.248
 No, no.

00:42.248 --> 00:48.248
 I've seen you, but I've never heard of
you.

00:49.248 --> 00:54.248
 I've only seen you on the escalator at
Sendai Station.

00:55.248 --> 00:58.248
 I haven't been doing my best.

01:00.248 --> 01:08.248
 I'm going to ask people if they know
you.

01:09.248 --> 01:10.248
 What?

01:10.248 --> 01:11.248
 Is it a general question?

01:12.248 --> 01:15.248
 I want to verify a theory.

01:16.248 --> 01:22.248
 If you're asked if you know about me,

01:23.248 --> 01:27.248
 I'm in a car commercial with ABEKATSU.

01:28.248 --> 01:29.248
 I see.

01:30.248 --> 01:31.248
 I'm told.

01:32.248 --> 01:34.248
 I'm also in a car commercial with
ABEKATSU.

01:35.248 --> 01:37.248
 Do you think I'm doing something?

01:37.248 --> 01:40.248
 I'm in a car commercial with ABEKATSU.

01:41.248 --> 01:42.248
 I see.

01:43.248 --> 01:47.248
 I'm going to verify a theory.

01:48.248 --> 01:49.248
 Interesting.

01:50.248 --> 01:52.248
 I've seen you, but I've never heard of
you.

01:53.248 --> 01:55.248
 I'm going to tell you.

01:56.248 --> 01:57.248
 It's like a commentator.

01:58.248 --> 02:00.248
 I'm going to increase the number of
viewers.

02:01.248 --> 02:02.248
 I'm going to increase the number of
viewers.

02:02.248 --> 02:07.248
 I'm going to make a board before I
leave.

02:08.248 --> 02:09.248
 I see.

02:10.248 --> 02:11.248
 I'm going to answer if you know me or
not.

02:12.248 --> 02:13.248
 I see.

02:14.248 --> 02:15.248
 I see.

02:16.248 --> 02:21.248
 I'm going to make a board and leave
when it's done.

02:22.248 --> 02:23.248
 I'm looking forward to it.

02:24.248 --> 02:28.248
 I'm going to make a board.

02:29.248 --> 02:30.248
 Let's get started.

02:30.248 --> 02:31.248
 Let's get started.

02:32.248 --> 02:34.248
 I'm going to tell you what you need.

02:35.248 --> 02:36.248
 Are you okay?

02:37.248 --> 02:38.248
 I'm sorry.

02:39.248 --> 02:40.248
 I'm going to tell you what people say.

02:41.248 --> 02:42.248
 I smell good.

02:43.248 --> 02:44.248
 I smell good.

02:45.248 --> 02:52.248
 I'm going to tell you what people say.

02:52.248 --> 02:59.248
 I'm going to tell you what people say.

03:00.248 --> 03:01.248
 I see.

03:02.248 --> 03:04.248
 You don't have to say anything.

03:05.248 --> 03:06.248
 I'm going to tell you what people say.

03:07.248 --> 03:08.248
 I'm going to tell you what people say.

03:09.248 --> 03:10.248
 I'm going to make a board.

03:11.248 --> 03:12.248
 Let's get started.

03:13.248 --> 03:17.248
 I'm going to tell you what people say.

03:17.248 --> 03:17.434
 I'm going to make a board.

03:19.568 --> 03:21.568
 I can do it!

03:21.568 --> 03:23.568
 I can do it!

03:23.568 --> 03:25.568
 No, it's not a car.

03:25.568 --> 03:27.568
 It's the east.

03:27.568 --> 03:29.568
 I can do it!

03:29.568 --> 03:31.568
 I saw it from a distance.

03:31.568 --> 03:33.568
 I can do it!

03:33.568 --> 03:35.568
 I'm scared.

03:35.568 --> 03:37.568
 I can't believe it's not a bear.

03:39.568 --> 03:41.568
 It's a bear with a square face.

03:41.568 --> 03:43.568
 What is it?

03:43.568 --> 03:45.568
 It's a bear with a straight neck.

03:45.568 --> 03:47.568
 No!

03:47.568 --> 03:49.568
 I hit a child.

03:49.568 --> 03:51.568
 What's wrong with you?

03:51.568 --> 03:53.568
 Are you OK?

03:53.568 --> 03:55.568
 I don't know.

03:55.568 --> 03:57.568
 I'll ask a professional painter.

03:57.568 --> 03:59.568
 I can't do it.

03:59.568 --> 04:01.568
 The eyes are facing down.

04:01.568 --> 04:03.568
 It's up.

04:03.568 --> 04:09.568
 Please subscribe to this channel.

04:09.882 --> 04:11.882
 I'm a little bit worried about the
angle.

04:11.882 --> 04:13.882
 Great!

04:13.882 --> 04:15.882
 Thank you.

04:15.882 --> 04:17.882
 Amazing.

04:17.882 --> 04:19.882
 It's done.

04:21.882 --> 04:23.882
 There is a CD.

04:23.882 --> 04:25.882
 Oh, yes.

04:27.882 --> 04:29.882
 It's a CD of Hinari Toku.

04:29.882 --> 04:31.882
 Please listen to it.

04:31.882 --> 04:33.882

04:33.882 --> 04:35.882
 I'm nervous.

04:35.882 --> 04:37.882
 I'm nervous.

04:37.882 --> 04:39.882
 I'm a little bit nervous.

04:39.882 --> 04:41.882
 I'll do my best.

04:41.882 --> 04:43.882
 I'm going to go.

04:43.882 --> 04:45.882
 Please look forward to the next video!

04:47.226 --> 04:52.506
 I came to the park.

04:52.506 --> 04:59.986
 There are a lot of people because it's
a child's season, so I think I'll ask
for a voice.

04:59.986 --> 05:03.386
 Let's do it.

05:03.386 --> 05:06.386
 I'm sorry.

05:06.386 --> 05:10.576
 I'm shooting a video, but is it okay to
shoot?

 Do you know who Iginori Tohoku is?

13:07.224 --> 13:09.224

13:28.224 --> 13:30.224
 I'm not the president of the district.

13:49.224 --> 13:53.224
 There is a beautiful park in the
district.

13:53.224 --> 13:58.224
 The district is producing rice for the
rice field.

13:58.224 --> 14:01.224
 I'm collaborating with Onagawa.

14:01.224 --> 14:06.224
 I'm going to plant rice with yuzu.

14:06.224 --> 14:08.224
 I like yuzu.

14:08.224 --> 14:12.224
 It takes time to grow it.

14:12.224 --> 14:14.224
 I'm looking forward to it.

14:39.224 --> 14:40.224
 I'm a fan of a commercial of Abekatsu
Automobile.

14:40.224 --> 14:42.224
 I know a lot of people.

14:42.224 --> 14:47.224
 I know a lot of people who know
Abekatsu Automobile.

14:47.224 --> 14:49.224
 It's a rich story.

14:49.224 --> 14:53.224
 We were surprised.

14:53.224 --> 14:57.224
 If we go to the district, more people
will know us.

14:57.224 --> 14:58.224
 That's right.

14:58.224 --> 14:59.224
 That's right.

14:59.224 --> 15:02.224
 Because everyone received our CDs.

15:02.224 --> 15:03.224
 I'm glad.

15:03.224 --> 15:05.224
 No one refused.

15:05.224 --> 15:06.224
 I'm glad.

15:06.224 --> 15:08.224
 I want to continue my activities.

15:08.224 --> 15:09.224
 Please do it.

15:09.224 --> 15:12.224
 I want to do it on Takeshita Street in
Harajuku.

15:12.224 --> 15:13.224
 No one knows it.

15:13.224 --> 15:16.224
 Only Miyagi knows it.

15:16.224 --> 15:21.224
 Please tell me the number of people you
know and don't know.

15:21.224 --> 15:22.224
 I know.

15:22.224 --> 15:23.224
 There are 14 people.

15:23.224 --> 15:24.224
 What about people you don't know?

15:24.224 --> 15:26.224
 There are 44 people.

15:26.224 --> 15:29.224
 There are many people you don't know.

15:29.224 --> 15:35.224
 But, I think everyone knows about
Abekatsu Automobile.

15:35.224 --> 15:37.224
 I love the fireworks.

15:37.224 --> 15:40.224
 I want to go home with fireworks.

15:40.224 --> 15:42.224
 I want to go home with fireworks.

15:42.224 --> 15:44.224
 But, we have a schedule after this.

15:44.224 --> 15:46.224
 So, we will go home.

15:46.224 --> 15:49.224
 I'm glad that we don't have a CD.

15:49.224 --> 15:50.224
 I'm glad.

15:50.224 --> 15:52.224
 Thank you.

15:52.224 --> 15:53.224
