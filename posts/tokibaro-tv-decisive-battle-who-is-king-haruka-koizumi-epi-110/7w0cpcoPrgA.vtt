WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:01.760
 It has started!

00:01.760 --> 00:06.760
 Yeah!

00:11.568 --> 00:13.568
 It's a new world.

00:13.568 --> 00:15.568
 It's like a place where you can do a
lot of things.

00:15.568 --> 00:17.568
 It's like that.

00:19.568 --> 00:21.568
 It's like that.

00:21.568 --> 00:23.568
 It's like a center.

00:27.568 --> 00:29.568
 What are we going to do?

00:29.568 --> 00:31.568
 This week is...

00:32.824 --> 00:38.824
 Last time, we did the Kanameiyo test at
Marumaru.

00:38.824 --> 00:39.824
 Do you remember that?

00:39.824 --> 00:40.824
 Of course.

00:40.824 --> 00:41.824
 Of course.

00:41.824 --> 00:42.824
 There's no way we can forget.

00:42.824 --> 00:43.824
 We were in front of the test.

00:43.824 --> 00:44.824
 We were like...

00:44.824 --> 00:45.824
 We were spread out.

00:47.824 --> 00:48.824
 We were like a big family.

00:48.824 --> 00:50.824
 It was like a big family.

00:52.824 --> 00:53.824
 Hiori said,

00:53.824 --> 00:55.824
 when we were trying to get started,

00:55.824 --> 00:56.824
 what was it?

00:56.824 --> 00:57.824
 She said,

00:57.824 --> 00:59.824
 let's do it!

00:59.824 --> 01:01.824
 That was the most fun.

01:01.824 --> 01:04.824
 I thought you were the one who set it
up.

01:06.824 --> 01:07.824
 You're cute.

01:08.824 --> 01:09.824
 You were cute.

01:10.824 --> 01:11.824
 So,

01:11.824 --> 01:13.824
 what are we going to do this time?

01:13.824 --> 01:14.824
 Last time,

01:14.824 --> 01:17.824
 we did the adult women,

01:17.824 --> 01:18.824
 Oharu-chan,

01:18.824 --> 01:19.824
 who was chosen as a new member.

01:19.824 --> 01:21.824
 We're going to do that.

01:21.824 --> 01:25.072
 Thank you for watching!

01:25.072 --> 01:27.072
 You look sexy in this photo.

01:27.072 --> 01:28.072
 Are you kidding me?

01:28.072 --> 01:30.072
 You look like a girl.

01:30.072 --> 01:31.072
 I'm not a girl.

01:31.072 --> 01:32.072
 I'm not a girl.

01:32.072 --> 01:34.072
 You look like a man.

01:34.072 --> 01:35.072
 You look like a man.

01:35.072 --> 01:38.072
 You look like a man.

01:38.072 --> 01:39.072
 You know,

01:39.072 --> 01:42.072
 recently,

01:42.072 --> 01:46.072
 you look like a sexy girl in Lion Girl.

01:46.072 --> 01:50.072
 You look like a girl in Lion Girl.

01:50.072 --> 01:52.072
 I love this.

01:52.072 --> 01:53.072
 You look like a girl.

01:53.072 --> 01:55.072
 You look like a girl.

01:55.072 --> 01:57.072
 Please subscribe to this channel!

01:58.920 --> 02:00.920
 We met like this in Japan.

02:01.920 --> 02:02.920
 We met like this.

02:05.920 --> 02:06.920
 We met like this a lot.

02:07.920 --> 02:09.920
 I see this a lot.

02:10.920 --> 02:11.920
 I know what you mean.

02:11.920 --> 02:19.920
 Please subscribe to this channel!

02:20.112 --> 02:21.112
 I don't know.

02:25.112 --> 02:26.112
 Whose is this?

02:26.112 --> 02:27.112
 It's Shizu's.

02:28.112 --> 02:30.112
 I don't know if I can tell.

02:30.112 --> 02:32.112
 TikTok or EnVy.

02:33.112 --> 02:34.112
 I know this.

02:36.112 --> 02:38.112
 I know this, but today...

02:38.112 --> 02:39.112
 I know.

02:40.112 --> 02:41.112
 I'm talking about myself.

02:41.112 --> 02:42.112
 No, I'm talking about sexy.

02:43.112 --> 02:44.112
 That's good.

02:45.112 --> 02:46.112
 I'm talking about cute.

02:46.112 --> 02:47.112
 No, no, no.

02:47.112 --> 02:48.112
 I'm talking about sexy.

02:48.112 --> 02:50.112
 We're both over 20 years old.

02:50.112 --> 02:51.112
 Let's move on.

02:52.112 --> 02:54.112
 You're all relaxed, aren't you?

02:55.112 --> 02:56.112
 We're relaxed.

02:56.112 --> 03:00.512
 Thank you for watching! Please
subscribe to this channel!

03:01.512 --> 03:03.512
 We've been together for 6 years.

03:05.512 --> 03:08.512
 I've been putting on lipsticks
recently.

03:10.512 --> 03:14.512
 I remember what I was doing with my
lipstick on.

03:16.512 --> 03:18.512
 I'm scared of being on camera.

03:24.512 --> 03:26.512
 Who's confident?

03:26.512 --> 03:28.512
 No one!

03:30.512 --> 03:32.512
 But it says, I'll do my best.

03:33.512 --> 03:34.512
 Oh my!

03:39.512 --> 03:42.512
 Aoharu has a lot of affection for
Julia.

03:43.512 --> 03:46.512
 I think Julia thinks a lot about
Aoharu.

03:47.512 --> 03:50.512
 So I think she's watching a lot of
Aoharu.

03:51.512 --> 03:53.512
 I used a lot of words.

03:53.512 --> 03:55.512
 I'm not confident.

03:56.512 --> 03:58.512
 I'm the MC today.

03:59.512 --> 04:02.512
 I'll ask Aki to explain the rules.

04:06.512 --> 04:08.512
 I'll explain the rules.

04:09.512 --> 04:12.512
 This time, we'll have a quiz about
Aoharu.

04:12.512 --> 04:15.512
 Aoharu has a lot of affection for
Julia.

04:17.192 --> 04:22.192
 We are going to answer the questions
that you have asked us.

04:23.192 --> 04:27.192
 It seems that it is easy to answer if
you understand Aoharu.

04:27.192 --> 04:29.192
 Let's do our best!

04:29.192 --> 04:31.192
 We will do our best!

04:34.592 --> 04:36.592
 1 point per person.

04:36.592 --> 04:38.592
 Oh, 1 point per person?

04:38.592 --> 04:40.592
 Wow.

04:40.592 --> 04:42.592
 1 point per person.

04:42.592 --> 04:44.592
 1 point per person.

04:44.592 --> 04:47.592
 For those who got the highest score in
the total,

04:47.592 --> 04:49.592
 there's a punishment.

04:49.592 --> 04:51.552
 That's it!

04:52.552 --> 04:58.552
 Last time, it was a punishment game
where you had to be a bear.

04:59.552 --> 05:01.552
 What are we going to be this time?

05:02.552 --> 05:03.552
 A Jiju-guruma!

05:06.552 --> 05:08.552
 That's a bit difficult.

05:11.552 --> 05:13.552
 Let's do our best!

05:13.552 --> 05:15.552
 Let's go!

05:16.552 --> 05:21.552
 This program is a program where 6
people who are active to do something
new,

05:21.552 --> 05:50.552
 challenge themselves and raise the
barometer of their daily lives.

05:54.104 --> 05:58.104
 The first question!

05:59.104 --> 06:01.104
 The first question!

06:02.104 --> 06:08.104
 What is Koharu's favorite food on the
super-special Kowaski website?

06:08.104 --> 06:10.104
 Corn potage!

06:10.104 --> 06:16.688
 What is the other one?

06:17.688 --> 06:20.688
 This is the profile from the beginning
of the tournament.

06:20.688 --> 06:22.688
 It hasn't changed.

06:22.688 --> 06:25.688
 I can see the difference.

06:25.688 --> 06:27.688
 It's always chubby.

06:27.688 --> 06:30.688
 It was chubby for a while.

06:30.688 --> 06:34.688
 You can see the difference if you look
at it.

06:34.688 --> 06:35.688
 Do you like it?

06:35.688 --> 06:36.688
 Yes, I do.

06:36.688 --> 06:37.688
 Do you eat it often?

06:37.688 --> 06:39.688
 Yes, I do.

06:39.688 --> 06:42.688
 It's not similar to the one I have.

06:42.688 --> 06:43.688
 It's different.

06:43.688 --> 06:46.688
 It's different from the one I have.

06:46.688 --> 06:48.688
 It's different from the one I have.

06:48.688 --> 06:49.688
 It's different.

06:50.688 --> 06:51.688
 It's like...

06:51.688 --> 06:52.688
 What?

06:52.688 --> 06:53.688
 I'm sorry.

06:53.688 --> 06:55.888
 Please watch again.

06:56.888 --> 06:58.888
 When did I eat this?

06:59.888 --> 07:01.888
 I haven't eaten this recently.

07:01.888 --> 07:02.888
 A while ago.

07:03.888 --> 07:04.888
 What?

07:04.888 --> 07:05.888
 It's rare.

07:07.888 --> 07:08.888
 I've been eating this for a long time.

07:08.888 --> 07:09.888
 A while ago.

07:09.888 --> 07:13.232
 Thank you for watching. Please
subscribe to my channel.

07:14.232 --> 07:16.232
 I don't know what you're talking about.

07:17.232 --> 07:18.232
 This is it.

07:18.232 --> 07:19.232
 What?

07:19.232 --> 07:20.232
 I've been saying this.

07:21.232 --> 07:23.232
 But I can't remember what I said.

07:24.232 --> 07:25.232
 I know what you're talking about.

07:25.232 --> 07:26.232
 I know what you're talking about.

07:28.232 --> 07:29.232
 I've been saying this on the stage.

07:30.232 --> 07:32.232
 Oh, that's not it.

07:35.232 --> 07:37.232
 We only have 6 seconds left.

07:37.232 --> 07:39.232
 We only have 6 seconds left.

07:40.890 --> 07:42.890
 I don't know.

07:43.890 --> 07:46.890
 Let's see the answers!

07:49.890 --> 07:51.890
 Chocobat.

07:53.890 --> 07:54.890
 Ramen.

07:55.890 --> 07:56.890
 Ramen.

07:56.890 --> 07:57.890
 Chocobo.

07:58.890 --> 08:00.890
 You said it.

08:01.890 --> 08:04.890
 You said it at the live.

08:05.890 --> 08:07.890
 I couldn't hear it.

08:07.890 --> 08:09.890
 I couldn't hear it.

08:10.890 --> 08:11.890
 I couldn't hear it.

08:12.890 --> 08:13.890
 I couldn't hear it.

08:14.890 --> 08:15.890
 It was a moment.

08:16.890 --> 08:18.890
 Let's see the answer!

08:18.890 --> 08:20.890
 Let's see the answer!

08:24.090 --> 08:34.090
 What is your favorite food in the
spring? Corn potage, Tantanmen, and what
is the last one?

08:34.090 --> 08:36.090
 The last one is...

08:36.090 --> 08:40.090
 Fruit!

08:40.090 --> 08:42.090
 Did you get it?

08:42.090 --> 08:44.090
 I don't get it at all.

08:44.090 --> 08:46.090
 I don't get it at all.

08:46.090 --> 08:52.090
 But it's written on the homepage of the
organization.

08:52.090 --> 08:56.090
 I've never heard of it.

08:56.090 --> 08:58.090
 Do you have it?

08:58.090 --> 08:59.090
 No.

08:59.090 --> 09:00.090
 No.

09:00.090 --> 09:01.090
 No.

09:01.090 --> 09:02.090
 No.

09:02.090 --> 09:03.090
 No.

09:03.090 --> 09:04.090
 No.

09:04.090 --> 09:05.090
 No.

09:05.090 --> 09:08.090
 I've never heard of it.

09:08.090 --> 09:10.090
 I've never heard of it.

09:10.090 --> 09:13.090
 I've never seen you eat it.

09:13.090 --> 09:16.090
 What is your favorite fruit?

09:16.090 --> 09:18.090
 I like peach.

09:18.090 --> 09:22.090
 I've never seen it.

09:22.090 --> 09:24.090
 I've never seen it.

09:24.090 --> 09:25.090
 I've never seen it.

09:25.090 --> 09:26.090
 I've never seen it.

09:26.090 --> 09:27.090
 I've never seen it.

09:27.090 --> 09:30.090
 I see.

09:30.090 --> 09:31.090
 It's difficult.

09:31.090 --> 09:32.090
 It's difficult.

09:32.090 --> 09:33.090
 It's difficult.

09:33.090 --> 09:40.016
 It's written on the homepage of the
organization.

09:41.016 --> 09:43.016
 Let's move on to the second question.

09:45.016 --> 09:48.016
 What was the most delicious thing that
you ate recently?

09:49.016 --> 09:51.016
 I think I've said this before.

09:51.016 --> 09:52.016
 I don't know.

09:55.040 --> 09:57.040
 Recently?

09:57.040 --> 09:59.040
 Recently?

09:59.040 --> 10:01.040
 How many people?

10:01.040 --> 10:03.040
 How many?

10:03.040 --> 10:05.040
 Recently?

10:05.040 --> 10:07.040
 Recently is in this month?

10:07.040 --> 10:09.040
 About that.

10:09.040 --> 10:11.920
 Thank you for watching! Please
subscribe to our channel!

10:12.920 --> 10:14.920
 There are some.

10:14.920 --> 10:16.920
 Is it this?

10:16.920 --> 10:18.920
 I ate it 3 times.

10:18.920 --> 10:20.920
 Then, it's not me.

10:20.920 --> 10:22.920
 I ate it 3 times.

10:22.920 --> 10:24.920
 I ate it 3 times.

10:24.920 --> 10:26.920
 Did you get it?

10:26.920 --> 10:29.920
 Let's open it!

10:30.920 --> 10:32.920
 Chocolate. Cup noodles.

10:32.920 --> 10:33.920
 Cherry blossom donut.

10:33.920 --> 10:34.920
 This is it.

10:34.920 --> 10:36.920
 Valentine's chocolate.

10:36.920 --> 10:38.920
 Yes, yes.

10:38.920 --> 10:39.888
 It's good.

10:40.888 --> 10:42.888
 It's like you're doing it for yourself.

10:42.888 --> 10:43.888
 I see.

10:43.888 --> 10:46.888
 Then, let's see the correct answer.

10:46.888 --> 10:48.888
 Next, Banzai!

10:50.296 --> 10:52.296
 What is the most delicious food you ate
recently?

10:53.296 --> 10:56.296
 The most delicious food I ate recently
is...

10:56.296 --> 10:59.296
 Shin Ramen's Kimchi flavor!

11:01.296 --> 11:03.296
 I wonder if everyone can tell.

11:04.296 --> 11:07.296
 I really like Shin Ramen.

11:10.296 --> 11:15.296
 I found a mild spicy Shin Ramen Kimchi
flavor.

11:15.296 --> 11:21.296
 It was a moderate spicy flavor and it
was very delicious.

11:21.296 --> 11:23.296
 It was the best to eat with rice.

11:26.584 --> 11:28.584
 Amazing!

11:28.584 --> 11:30.584
 You got it right!

11:31.584 --> 11:33.584
 We talked about it.

11:34.584 --> 11:37.584
 I thought it was a new name, but it was
a wide range.

11:37.584 --> 11:38.584
 That's right.

11:39.584 --> 11:41.584
 You are smart.

11:41.584 --> 11:45.584
 You said it was a plant, so I thought
it was a cherry blossom donut.

11:45.584 --> 11:48.584
 I thought it was a cherry blossom
donut.

11:48.584 --> 11:50.584
 It was written on the block.

11:50.584 --> 11:52.584
 It was written that it was delicious.

11:52.584 --> 11:55.584
 We have only eaten it once.

11:57.864 --> 11:59.864
 This is the first time I have eaten
Shin Ramen and Kimchi.

11:59.864 --> 12:01.864
 It's very delicious.

12:02.864 --> 12:03.864
 It's a little difficult.

12:06.864 --> 12:07.864
 There are many things to eat.

12:07.864 --> 12:08.864
 Can we go?

12:08.864 --> 12:14.864
 Please subscribe to this channel.

12:16.856 --> 12:19.856
 Let's move on to the next question.

12:20.856 --> 12:22.856
 What did you have for breakfast in the
spring?

12:23.856 --> 12:25.856
 I haven't told you the answer.

12:26.856 --> 12:28.856
 I haven't told you the story.

12:29.856 --> 12:30.856
 I'm just saying.

12:31.856 --> 12:32.856
 You'll know if I tell you.

12:32.856 --> 12:35.856
 But I eat a lot.

12:38.312 --> 12:39.312
 It's hard.

12:39.312 --> 12:41.312
 Ramen? From morning?

12:41.312 --> 12:43.312
 I can only think of ramen.

12:43.312 --> 12:47.312
 I think it's that kind of ramen.

12:50.440 --> 12:52.440
 I've definitely eaten it.

12:52.440 --> 12:54.440
 I've definitely talked to Hiyori about
it.

12:56.440 --> 12:58.440
 You can eat this in the morning.

12:58.440 --> 13:00.440
 But there are quite a lot of people who
say,

13:00.440 --> 13:02.440
 Did you eat it in the morning?

13:02.440 --> 13:05.440
 I'm the type of person who can eat
that.

13:06.440 --> 13:08.440
 So it's a lot.

13:08.440 --> 13:10.440
 I think so.

13:10.440 --> 13:12.440
 I've never eaten that kind of thing.

13:12.440 --> 13:18.440
 I think I can eat it.

13:21.120 --> 13:23.120
 It's hard.

13:23.120 --> 13:24.120
 It's over.

13:24.120 --> 13:27.120
 Everyone, it's over.

13:27.120 --> 13:28.120
 What?

13:28.120 --> 13:29.120
 What?

13:29.120 --> 13:30.120
 Why do you look so handsome?

13:30.120 --> 13:31.120
 What?

13:31.120 --> 13:32.120
 What?

13:32.120 --> 13:33.120
 What?

13:33.120 --> 13:34.120
 Curry.

13:34.120 --> 13:36.120
 One more time.

13:36.120 --> 13:37.120
 Why do you look so handsome?

13:39.120 --> 13:40.120
 One more time.

13:40.120 --> 13:41.120
 One more time.

13:41.120 --> 13:42.120
 Why do you look so handsome?

13:42.120 --> 13:43.120
 I'm handsome.

13:43.120 --> 13:45.120
 Why do you look so handsome?

13:45.120 --> 13:46.120
 What?

13:46.120 --> 13:47.120
 What?

13:47.120 --> 13:48.120
 What?

13:48.120 --> 13:49.120
 What?

13:51.120 --> 13:53.120
 I'm asking you the right answer.

13:55.120 --> 13:57.120
 It's so funny.

13:57.120 --> 13:59.120
 It's too natural.

13:59.120 --> 14:01.120
 I have to say it because it's a
question.

14:02.120 --> 14:03.120
 One more time.

14:03.120 --> 14:04.120
 One more time.

14:04.120 --> 14:05.120
 Pasta.

14:05.120 --> 14:06.120
 Love.

14:08.120 --> 14:09.120
 Curry.

14:09.120 --> 14:11.120
 I thought of curry, too.

14:11.120 --> 14:13.120
 I ate curry for breakfast before.

14:13.120 --> 14:14.120
 I can't eat it at all.

14:14.120 --> 14:15.120
 I can't eat it.

14:15.120 --> 14:16.120
 I can't eat it.

14:16.120 --> 14:17.120
 My bangs are messy.

14:17.120 --> 14:23.088
 The answer is...

14:24.088 --> 14:27.088
 What is your breakfast today?

14:27.088 --> 14:30.088
 My breakfast today is...

14:30.088 --> 14:32.088
 Pasta!

14:33.088 --> 14:37.088
 I ate a creamy bolognese every day.

14:37.088 --> 14:39.088
 I love it.

14:39.088 --> 14:43.088
 I ate a creamy bolognese every day.

14:44.088 --> 14:45.088
 You did it!

14:45.088 --> 14:50.088
 Please subscribe to this channel!

14:51.272 --> 14:53.272
 I'm glad you like it.

14:53.272 --> 14:55.272
 It was a good experience.

14:56.272 --> 14:58.272
 I thought you ate pasta.

14:59.272 --> 15:01.272
 I ate it after warming it up.

15:06.272 --> 15:07.272
 It's good.

15:07.272 --> 15:09.272
 I got a good impression.

15:09.272 --> 15:11.272
 Everyone got 1 point.

15:11.272 --> 15:13.272
 What did you eat?

15:13.272 --> 15:20.272
 Thank you for watching.

15:21.656 --> 15:24.656
 I ate egg and salad.

15:25.656 --> 15:28.656
 What did you eat for breakfast?

15:29.656 --> 15:31.656
 I ate Anpanman.

15:33.656 --> 15:34.656
 Do you know that?

15:35.656 --> 15:40.656
 I like grapes the most.

15:41.656 --> 15:42.656
 Yes, yes.

15:42.656 --> 15:45.656
 Thank you for watching.

15:47.176 --> 15:49.176
 I want to eat the egg.

15:52.176 --> 15:53.176
 I want to eat the rice with soybean
flour.

15:54.176 --> 15:55.176
 I want to eat that.

15:57.176 --> 15:58.176
 I want to eat that.

15:58.176 --> 16:18.176
 I want to eat the rice with soybean
flour.

16:23.418 --> 16:27.418
 Let's move on to the next question.

16:29.418 --> 16:32.418
 What was the first thing Oharu tried
recently?

16:32.418 --> 16:34.418
 I wrote this on my blog.

16:34.418 --> 16:35.418
 What?

16:36.418 --> 16:38.418
 I wrote this on my blog.

16:42.418 --> 16:46.418
 My manager told me to try this.

16:46.418 --> 16:52.032
 I'm sure I'm right.

16:53.032 --> 16:55.032
 I wrote it on my blog.

16:55.032 --> 16:57.032
 I did it yesterday.

17:00.552 --> 17:02.552
 I forgot where I was.

17:06.552 --> 17:09.552
 I think I will be addicted to it if I
do it once.

17:10.552 --> 17:11.552
 Really?

17:11.552 --> 17:12.552
 Maybe not.

17:13.552 --> 17:14.552
 I think it's not.

17:14.552 --> 17:15.552
 5 seconds ago.

17:23.552 --> 17:24.552
 OK, everyone.

17:25.552 --> 17:26.552
 Ready? Open!

17:26.552 --> 17:30.552
 I tried to play a song of Tochi-chan on
the guitar.

17:31.552 --> 17:32.552
 IZTV.

17:34.552 --> 17:35.552
 You did it.

17:35.552 --> 17:36.552
 No, I didn't.

17:37.552 --> 17:38.552
 I played the guitar on the guitar.

17:40.552 --> 17:41.552
 I see.

17:41.552 --> 17:43.552
 OK, let's start the VTR.

17:46.552 --> 17:49.552
 What is the first thing you tried
recently?

17:49.552 --> 17:55.552
 The first thing I tried recently is
Uber Eats.

17:56.552 --> 17:57.552
 Wait!

17:57.552 --> 17:58.552
 No way!

17:59.552 --> 18:01.552
 I thought you would say the same thing.

18:01.552 --> 18:02.552
 I thought so.

18:04.552 --> 18:07.552
 I thought you would say, I tried it.

18:07.552 --> 18:08.552
 What did you think?

18:10.552 --> 18:11.552
 No way!

18:11.552 --> 18:12.552
 But it's the same.

18:12.552 --> 18:13.552
 Really?

18:13.552 --> 18:15.552
 I tried Uber Eats for the first time.

18:15.552 --> 18:16.552
 What did you order?

18:16.552 --> 18:17.552
 Chicken.

18:17.552 --> 18:19.552
 Oh, you ordered chicken. I thought you
would say curry.

18:20.552 --> 18:21.552
 Curry.

18:21.552 --> 18:22.552
 What?

18:22.552 --> 18:23.552
 I thought you would say curry.

18:23.552 --> 18:25.552
 Oh, I like curry.

18:26.552 --> 18:27.552
 It's delicious.

18:27.552 --> 18:28.552
 It's delicious.

18:30.552 --> 18:32.552
 I thought you would say the same thing.

18:32.552 --> 18:33.440
 I thought so.

18:34.440 --> 18:36.440
 I played the guitar in ICTV.

18:39.440 --> 18:41.440
 I saw you playing the guitar.

18:48.440 --> 18:50.440
 Let's move on to the next question.

18:52.440 --> 18:54.440
 What was your dream when you were a
child?

18:55.440 --> 18:57.440
 I'm sure I said this.

18:58.440 --> 18:59.440
 Dream?

18:59.440 --> 19:01.440
 I knew it.

19:02.128 --> 19:04.928
 But I think that's probably right.

19:04.928 --> 19:09.928
 What?

19:10.656 --> 19:12.656
 I'm sure I'm saying it.

19:12.656 --> 19:14.656
 I think it's a scene from the past.

19:14.656 --> 19:16.656
 What?

19:16.656 --> 19:18.656
 Let's say it together.

19:18.656 --> 19:20.656
 Juri is so tired.

19:20.656 --> 19:22.656
 Konyuu-san.

19:22.656 --> 19:24.656
 Konya-san.

19:24.656 --> 19:26.656
 What?

19:26.656 --> 19:28.656
 I thought it was written as cat.

19:28.656 --> 19:30.656
 Cat?

19:30.656 --> 19:32.656
 It's Konya.

19:32.656 --> 19:34.656
 Julia's answer is almost ramen.

19:34.656 --> 19:36.656
 Ramen.

19:36.656 --> 19:38.656
 I'm not kidding.

19:38.656 --> 19:40.656
 It's almost ramen.

19:40.656 --> 19:42.656
 Then, let's start the world cultural
exchange!

19:45.136 --> 19:48.136
 What is your future dream when you were
a child?

19:48.136 --> 19:58.136
 I think some people have already told
you this, but I want to be a bookstore
clerk.

19:58.136 --> 20:14.576
 I want to be a bookstore clerk and
publish books and carry books.

20:15.576 --> 20:17.576
 We got the same score!

20:17.576 --> 20:19.576
 Wow!

20:19.576 --> 20:21.576
 Kanamin and...

20:21.576 --> 20:22.576
 Hitoka?

20:22.576 --> 20:23.576
 Yurika!

20:23.576 --> 20:26.576
 Yurika and Yano got the same score!

20:28.576 --> 20:29.576
 We got the same score!

20:29.576 --> 20:30.576
 Wow!

20:30.576 --> 20:32.576
 We got the same score!

20:32.576 --> 20:37.576
 The next is...

20:37.576 --> 20:40.944
 Okay! Let's go to the next one!

20:41.944 --> 20:43.944
 What does Oharu want to make next?

20:43.944 --> 20:45.944
 I haven't told you yet.

20:50.944 --> 20:52.944
 I want to make food.

20:52.944 --> 20:54.944
 I know what you want to make.

20:54.944 --> 20:56.944
 Really?

20:56.944 --> 20:58.944
 Do you know what I want to make?

20:58.944 --> 21:00.944
 That's it! Oharu!

21:00.944 --> 21:02.944
 I'm not sure.

21:04.232 --> 21:07.232
 I don't know anything about ramen.

21:07.232 --> 21:09.232
 I don't know anything about ramen.

21:10.232 --> 21:11.232
 Do you like it?

21:11.232 --> 21:12.232
 I like it.

21:12.232 --> 21:14.232
 I hope you know what I like.

21:14.232 --> 21:17.232
 I like pretty much everything.

21:19.232 --> 21:20.232
 Do you eat it often?

21:20.232 --> 21:21.232
 I do.

21:21.232 --> 21:26.232
 I eat it often at Chinese restaurants.

21:27.800 --> 21:28.800
 Cheese Choco

21:28.800 --> 21:29.800
 No way!

21:29.800 --> 21:30.800
 Chinese restaurant?

21:30.800 --> 21:31.800
 Ramen?

21:32.800 --> 21:36.800
 Let's open your answers!

21:37.800 --> 21:38.800
 Mapo Tofu

21:38.800 --> 21:39.800
 Sesame dumpling

21:39.800 --> 21:40.800
 Tofu

21:40.800 --> 21:41.800
 Gyoza

21:41.800 --> 21:42.800
 Gyoza!

21:42.800 --> 21:43.800
 Gyoza!

21:43.800 --> 21:45.800
 I thought it was shrimp and chili.

21:46.800 --> 21:47.800
 I thought it was shrimp and chili.

21:47.800 --> 21:48.800
 How do you eat shrimp and chili?

21:48.800 --> 21:49.800
 From the beginning

21:49.800 --> 21:50.800
 From the soup

21:51.800 --> 21:52.800
 I want to try it.

21:52.800 --> 21:53.800
 It's hard.

21:53.800 --> 21:54.800
 I want to try it.

21:54.800 --> 21:56.800
 Gyoza is...

21:56.800 --> 21:58.800
 I'm going to make it.

21:59.800 --> 22:00.800
 What do you mean?

22:00.800 --> 22:01.800
 What do you mean?

22:01.800 --> 22:02.800
 What do you mean?

22:02.800 --> 22:03.800
 Yes!

22:03.800 --> 22:08.112
 Please watch the next video!

22:08.112 --> 22:11.112
 What does Koharu want to make next?

22:11.112 --> 22:14.112
 The answer is...

22:14.112 --> 22:16.112
 Mabo Tofu!

22:16.112 --> 22:19.112
 It's Mabo Tofu!

22:19.112 --> 22:22.112
 I thought normal Mabo Tofu would be
good,

22:22.112 --> 22:26.112
 but I like spicy food,

22:26.112 --> 22:31.112
 so I want to make a Mabo Tofu that
looks like Shisen.

22:31.112 --> 22:33.112
 Amazing!

22:33.112 --> 22:35.112
 Correct!

22:35.112 --> 22:38.112
 Why did you get angry?

22:38.112 --> 22:40.112
 I don't know.

22:40.112 --> 22:44.112
 I think I can make fried rice.

22:44.112 --> 22:49.112
 I thought I would make it if I made it
for the first time.

22:49.112 --> 22:51.112
 I don't know.

22:51.112 --> 22:54.112
 I want to make Mabo Tofu.

22:54.112 --> 23:03.112
 I want to make something like Shisen
style.

23:03.112 --> 23:06.112
 So, you are the leader.

23:11.450 --> 23:14.450
 Good luck everyone!

23:14.450 --> 23:15.450
 Next!

23:16.450 --> 23:20.450
 What do you feel you've grown up a
little?

23:22.450 --> 23:23.450
 In what way?

23:24.450 --> 23:25.450
 In your private life.

23:26.450 --> 23:27.450
 Private life?

23:28.450 --> 23:30.450
 Like cooking?

23:30.450 --> 23:31.450
 Something like that.

23:32.450 --> 23:34.450
 I can think like that.

23:34.450 --> 23:36.450
 What? Think?

23:38.472 --> 23:42.472
 Let's open it!

23:43.472 --> 23:44.472
 Be careful of the food.

23:45.472 --> 23:47.472
 I have to make a meal.

23:48.472 --> 23:51.472
 You can decide what to eat right away.

23:54.472 --> 23:55.472
 This is a person.

23:55.472 --> 24:00.472
 Thank you for your viewing.

24:00.496 --> 24:02.496
 Well then,

24:02.496 --> 24:04.496
 Let's do it together.

24:05.496 --> 24:07.496
 Let's watch the video!

24:08.496 --> 24:12.496
 What do you feel you've grown as
yourself?

24:12.496 --> 24:14.496
 Yes, bye-bye!

24:15.560 --> 24:16.560
 What?

24:16.560 --> 24:17.560
 Oh, I see.

24:17.560 --> 24:18.560
 Yes!

24:22.560 --> 24:26.560
 Yes, I think I've grown as myself.

24:26.560 --> 24:39.560
 I've started to think that I should
cook myself once a week, twice a week,
or three times a week.

24:39.560 --> 24:45.560
 I think I've grown as myself.

24:45.560 --> 24:46.560
 Yes!

24:47.560 --> 24:48.560
 Wait, wait, wait.

24:48.560 --> 24:50.560
 I think I've grown as myself.

24:50.560 --> 24:51.560
 Wait, wait, wait.

24:51.560 --> 24:52.560
 I'm right, right?

24:52.560 --> 24:54.560
 I think you're right.

24:54.560 --> 24:57.560
 But if you're not, you have to clean
up.

24:57.560 --> 24:58.560
 I have to be careful about my diet.

24:59.560 --> 25:00.560
 Why do you have to be careful about
your diet?

25:00.560 --> 25:01.560
 That's a big deal.

25:01.560 --> 25:02.560
 What?

25:02.560 --> 25:04.560
 What should I do? Can I decide?

25:04.560 --> 25:05.560
 That's a big deal.

25:05.560 --> 25:06.560
 Wait, wait.

25:06.560 --> 25:09.560
 I think you have to be careful about
your diet.

25:09.560 --> 25:10.560
 Can I decide?

25:10.560 --> 25:11.560
 Yes.

25:11.560 --> 25:12.560
 I'll do it!

25:12.560 --> 25:13.560
 Yes!

25:14.560 --> 25:15.560
 I'm glad.

25:15.560 --> 25:16.560
 Thank you.

25:16.560 --> 25:17.560
 Thank you.

25:18.560 --> 25:20.560
 Julia's answer is awesome.

25:20.560 --> 25:22.560
 She's like a mom who helps her kids.

25:22.560 --> 25:23.560
 A mom who helps her kids.

25:24.560 --> 25:27.560
 She's writing down everything that
seems to be right.

25:28.560 --> 25:29.560
 A mom who helps her kids.

25:30.560 --> 25:31.560
 You didn't have a fire in your stomach.

25:31.560 --> 25:32.560
 No.

25:32.560 --> 25:34.560
 I'm glad.

25:34.560 --> 25:35.560
 I'm glad.

25:35.560 --> 25:36.560
 I'm glad.

25:37.560 --> 25:39.560
 Hitoka and I are in the same group.

25:39.560 --> 25:47.002
 Please do your best!

25:47.002 --> 25:49.002
 Next question!

25:50.002 --> 25:56.002
 Which part of Julia do you like the
most?

25:57.002 --> 25:58.002
 Part of Julia?

25:59.002 --> 26:00.002
 Part of Julia?

26:04.002 --> 26:05.002
 All of them?

26:05.002 --> 26:08.002
 Part of Julia?

26:08.730 --> 26:10.730
 You're being watched.

26:10.730 --> 26:12.730
 Which one?

26:12.730 --> 26:14.730
 I can't give you a hint.

26:14.730 --> 26:16.730
 Looks?

26:16.730 --> 26:18.730
 I can't give you a hint.

26:18.730 --> 26:20.730
 Personality?

26:20.730 --> 26:22.730
 I see.

26:22.730 --> 26:24.730
 Looks?

26:24.730 --> 26:26.730
 I see.

26:26.730 --> 26:28.730
 Which one?

26:28.730 --> 26:30.730
 I can't give you a hint.

26:30.730 --> 26:32.730
 I can't give you a hint.

26:32.730 --> 26:34.730
 I see.

26:35.784 --> 26:36.784
 The first one?

26:36.784 --> 26:38.784
 The first one is the part, right?

26:38.784 --> 26:39.784
 Yes.

26:39.784 --> 26:41.784
 The first one is the part?

26:41.784 --> 26:42.784
 The first one?

26:42.784 --> 26:44.784
 Let's go!

26:46.152 --> 26:48.152
 I like this one.

26:49.152 --> 26:51.152
 I think so, too.

26:53.152 --> 26:55.152
 If you're wrong, you'll be punished.

26:56.152 --> 26:58.152
 It'll be funny if Julia is wrong.

26:59.152 --> 27:01.152
 Let's open it!

27:02.152 --> 27:03.152
 All of them?

27:03.152 --> 27:04.152
 All of them.

27:04.152 --> 27:06.152
 Eyes, face.

27:09.152 --> 27:11.152
 Let's start!

27:11.152 --> 27:13.152
 Do you have any?

27:13.152 --> 27:16.152
 What is your favorite part of Julia?

27:17.152 --> 27:20.152
 My favorite part of Julia is...

27:22.152 --> 27:24.152
 Everything.

27:24.152 --> 27:26.152
 You're right!

27:28.152 --> 27:30.152
 That's not fair!

27:31.152 --> 27:33.152
 You said you like everything.

27:34.152 --> 27:36.152
 I like everything.

27:36.152 --> 27:38.152
 I like everything.

27:40.152 --> 27:42.152
 You did it!

27:43.152 --> 27:46.152
 Kana-Yu, Julia, Hitoka, and Aki!

27:47.152 --> 27:50.152
 Hitoka and Aki are correct!

27:53.152 --> 27:55.152
 We're on the same team!

27:56.152 --> 27:58.152
 I don't think it's fair.

28:00.152 --> 28:03.152
 If you were to choose, who would you
choose?

28:03.152 --> 28:05.152
 I'd choose Egao.

28:05.152 --> 28:07.152
 I'd choose all of them.

28:13.152 --> 28:15.152
 You look like you're laughing.

28:15.152 --> 28:23.386
 The three of them are correct!

28:23.386 --> 28:27.566
 Everything is focused on theshaped.

28:32.442 --> 28:34.442
 2 more!

28:36.442 --> 28:40.442
 What do you want to do someday?

28:40.442 --> 28:42.442
 What do I want to do?

28:42.442 --> 28:44.442
 I didn't think about that.

28:44.442 --> 28:46.442
 What do I want to do?

28:46.442 --> 28:48.442
 What do you want to do?

28:48.442 --> 28:50.442
 What do I want to do?

28:50.442 --> 28:53.442
 This is a bit difficult.

28:53.442 --> 28:58.442
 I think everyone wants to do it at
least once.

28:58.442 --> 29:00.442
 You've never done it, right?

29:00.442 --> 29:02.442
 No, I haven't.

29:02.442 --> 29:04.442
 I know!

29:05.624 --> 29:07.624
 I know someone who has done it alone.

29:07.624 --> 29:08.624
 Who?

29:08.624 --> 29:10.624
 Someone who has done it alone.

29:10.624 --> 29:11.624
 Who?

29:12.624 --> 29:14.624
 I know who.

29:14.624 --> 29:16.624
 I know who.

29:16.624 --> 29:17.624
 Yes, I have.

29:17.624 --> 29:18.624
 What?

29:18.624 --> 29:19.624
 What?

29:19.624 --> 29:20.624
 What?

29:20.624 --> 29:21.624
 What?

29:23.624 --> 29:24.624
 There are many.

29:24.624 --> 29:25.624
 Yes, there are.

29:25.624 --> 29:28.480
 Please check the description for the
translation!

29:29.480 --> 29:31.480
 Wait, wait.

29:31.480 --> 29:32.480
 What's this?

29:32.480 --> 29:33.480
 Looks?

29:34.480 --> 29:35.480
 Hiyori-chan has never done it.

29:35.480 --> 29:36.480
 Why?

29:36.480 --> 29:38.480
 What did Hiyori do?

29:38.480 --> 29:40.480
 What did Hiyori do?

29:40.480 --> 29:41.480
 I don't know.

29:41.480 --> 29:43.480
 Hiyori-chan has never done it.

29:43.480 --> 29:45.480
 Why haven't we all done it?

29:45.480 --> 29:47.480
 Isn't it because it's rare?

29:48.480 --> 29:50.480
 What did Hiyori do?

29:51.480 --> 29:52.480
 What?

29:52.480 --> 29:54.480
 I don't know.

29:54.480 --> 29:56.480
 I don't know.

29:58.520 --> 30:00.520
 You want to try, right?

30:00.520 --> 30:02.520
 I definitely want to try.

30:09.520 --> 30:12.520
 Okay, everyone, open!

30:12.520 --> 30:15.520
 Gunpla defence

30:16.368 --> 30:18.368
 What's the first thing you want to do
on the river?

30:19.368 --> 30:21.368
 I want to play in the river!

30:25.368 --> 30:27.368
 I want to play in the river!

30:30.368 --> 30:31.368
 That's cute!

30:33.368 --> 30:35.368
 I've never heard of it!

30:36.368 --> 30:38.368
 You want to play in the river?

30:40.368 --> 30:41.368
 I'll go next!

30:41.368 --> 30:43.368
 Go ahead!

30:43.368 --> 30:47.368
 What do you want to try someday?

30:47.368 --> 30:49.368
 I want to try someday!

30:51.352 --> 30:52.352
 What?

30:52.352 --> 30:53.352
 I want to try someday.

30:53.352 --> 30:55.352
 You're looking at the question.

30:55.352 --> 30:56.352
 Oh, I see.

30:58.352 --> 31:02.352
 Yes, what I want to try someday is...

31:02.352 --> 31:05.040
 Wakko Sawa!

31:06.040 --> 31:09.040
 Do you know what it is? I don't think
you know.

31:09.040 --> 31:13.040
 I've never said Wakko Sawa in my life.

31:13.040 --> 31:17.040
 I don't care if it's not once. I want
to try Wakko Sawa.

31:17.040 --> 31:18.040
 I think so, too.

31:18.040 --> 31:19.040
 Oh, it's Wakko Sawa.

31:20.040 --> 31:21.040
 It's not.

31:22.040 --> 31:23.040
 Kawagoe.

31:23.040 --> 31:24.040
 Yes, I ate it with Kawagoe.

31:25.040 --> 31:26.040
 It's not Wakko Sawa.

31:28.040 --> 31:29.040
 I'm like this, too.

31:31.040 --> 31:32.040
 But you said it.

31:32.040 --> 31:33.040
 I said it.

31:33.040 --> 31:34.040
 I think so.

31:34.040 --> 31:38.040
 But, you know, Oharu, you said you
wanted to do this.

31:38.040 --> 31:39.040
 Which one?

31:39.040 --> 31:40.040
 Ganmenpai.

31:40.040 --> 31:42.040
 Yes, it was Wakko Sawa.

31:42.040 --> 31:43.040
 It was difficult.

31:44.040 --> 31:45.040
 You didn't know that, did you?

31:45.040 --> 31:46.040
 I didn't know.

31:46.040 --> 31:47.040
 I didn't know.

31:48.040 --> 31:49.040
 Then, the last one.

31:50.040 --> 31:57.040
 The current points are Kanamin and Jiki
Toka 3 points, Julia 2 points, Aki and
Hiyo 1 point.

31:57.040 --> 31:58.040
 I don't like it.

31:58.040 --> 32:01.040
 I don't like it.

32:01.040 --> 32:02.040
 I think it's too difficult.

32:02.040 --> 32:04.288
 Please look forward to the next video!

32:05.288 --> 32:07.288
 I've never heard of it.

32:07.288 --> 32:09.288
 I'm kidding.

32:09.288 --> 32:15.288
 If you get the next question right,
you'll get 2 points.

32:15.288 --> 32:17.288
 If you get the last question right.

32:17.288 --> 32:22.288
 If you get the last question right,
you'll get 2 points.

32:22.288 --> 32:24.288
 The last question!

32:24.288 --> 32:30.288
 What animal do you want to be when
spring comes?

32:30.554 --> 32:33.554
 I also wrote multiple answers.

32:33.554 --> 32:35.554
 Anything is fine.

32:35.554 --> 32:37.554
 I don't think so.

32:37.554 --> 32:39.554
 I can't think of any names.

32:39.554 --> 32:42.554
 If I get one right, I'll give you a
point.

32:42.554 --> 32:44.554
 You can write a lot.

32:44.554 --> 32:46.554
 If I get one wrong, I'll get one wrong.

32:46.554 --> 32:47.554
 You can write a lot.

32:47.554 --> 32:49.554
 I can't write a lot.

32:49.554 --> 32:55.610
 Let's do it this way.

32:55.610 --> 32:58.610
 Let's open it together!

32:58.610 --> 32:59.610
 Ta-da!

32:59.610 --> 33:00.610
 Raw kimono!

33:00.610 --> 33:01.610
 Raw kimono!

33:01.610 --> 33:02.610
 Raw kimono!

33:02.610 --> 33:03.610
 Raw kimono!

33:03.610 --> 33:04.610
 Oh!

33:04.610 --> 33:05.610
 Oh no!

33:05.610 --> 33:06.610
 This is...

33:06.610 --> 33:07.610
 Do you see it?

33:07.610 --> 33:09.680
 Here you go!

33:09.680 --> 33:12.680
 What kind of animal do you want to be
when you are reborn?

33:13.680 --> 33:17.680
 I have a lot of animals I want to be
when I am reborn.

33:18.680 --> 33:22.680
 I think you all know what I mean.

33:23.680 --> 33:25.680
 I want to be a dog or a sloth.

33:26.680 --> 33:31.680
 I think you all know what I mean.

33:32.680 --> 33:34.680
 If you don't know what I mean, please
look it up.

33:34.680 --> 33:44.680
 I want to be a monkey or a hyena.

33:45.680 --> 33:47.680
 I want to be a mandrill.

33:48.680 --> 33:55.680
 I want to be a monkey or a hyena.

33:56.680 --> 33:59.680
 It would be great if you know what I
mean.

33:59.680 --> 34:05.680
 It would be great if you know what I
mean.

34:05.680 --> 34:09.680
 Everyone got it right!

34:12.040 --> 34:16.040
 I want everyone to see the mangrove.

34:19.040 --> 34:21.040
 I've seen it before!

34:23.040 --> 34:26.040
 I've seen it in the movie, but it's
called Lion King.

34:26.040 --> 34:28.040
 That's right!

34:28.040 --> 34:38.800
 I want to be a father to this!

34:39.800 --> 34:41.800
 Kanamin and Hitoka got the same score!

34:41.800 --> 34:42.800
 Yay!

34:45.800 --> 34:48.800
 So, Oharu is Kanamin and Hitoka!

34:48.800 --> 34:50.800
 Yay!

34:52.800 --> 34:58.800
 So, the last one is Aki and Hiyori!

34:58.800 --> 35:04.528
 We are going to imitate animals!

35:05.528 --> 35:08.068
 nosotros

35:08.088 --> 35:09.488
 Como

35:09.488 --> 35:12.068
 ah ah ah

35:12.888 --> 35:15.348
 pa

35:15.348 --> 35:17.348
 I won't let go of your hand

35:18.298 --> 35:20.298
 I'm going to go from there.

35:20.298 --> 35:22.298
 From the entrance.

35:26.298 --> 35:28.298
 I can see it.

35:28.298 --> 35:30.298
 It's like a movie.

35:30.298 --> 35:40.298
 Thank you for watching.

35:41.480 --> 35:42.480
 What are you doing?

35:42.480 --> 35:43.480
 Are you in a relationship?

35:44.480 --> 35:45.480
 Are you in a relationship?

35:46.480 --> 35:47.480
 Are you a couple?

35:57.480 --> 35:58.480
 Do you talk to each other?

35:59.480 --> 36:01.480
 I don't know what we are talking about.

36:02.480 --> 36:05.480
 Ramen

36:05.480 --> 36:07.480
 Oh, yeah!

36:07.632 --> 36:09.632
 Tasty

36:09.632 --> 36:11.632
 This is a soup

36:13.632 --> 36:15.632
 Aki-chan

36:15.632 --> 36:17.632
 So

36:21.632 --> 36:23.632
 Salt

36:23.632 --> 36:25.632
 Salt

36:27.632 --> 36:29.632
 Miso

 Miso...

36:38.410 --> 36:40.410
 Shime...

36:40.410 --> 36:42.410
 I'm a little scared.

36:42.410 --> 36:44.410
 It's a big one.

36:44.410 --> 36:46.410
 It's a big one.

 Kaho-chan!

 I can say it now, the reason for my
tears

38:47.330 --> 38:48.864
 Is that I realized I was lost

38:48.864 --> 38:50.864
 I remember it right away

38:50.864 --> 38:54.864
 Even if it rains, I'll smile

38:54.864 --> 38:58.864
 Look, let's go anywhere

38:59.864 --> 39:03.864
 Goodbye, goodbye, yesterday's me

39:03.864 --> 39:07.864
 The city lights after the rain are
sparkling

39:07.864 --> 39:09.864
 My heart is like a sunny day

39:09.864 --> 39:11.864
 I play the sound of a rainbow

39:11.864 --> 39:15.864
 I play the rainbow piano

39:15.864 --> 39:19.864
 Goodbye, goodbye, yesterday's me

39:19.864 --> 39:23.864
 The city lights after the rain are
sparkling

39:23.864 --> 39:25.864
 My heart is like a flower

39:25.864 --> 39:27.864
 I cry and dance

39:27.864 --> 39:46.864
 I wear a rainbow dress
