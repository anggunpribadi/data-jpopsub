1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
I cried for the first time at the
airport where I went to the training
camp

2
00:00:05,500 --> 00:00:10,000
The two new members of Ebichu, Sakurai
Emma and Nakamura Yuna

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:14,500
will share their memories of the
training camp

4
00:00:14,500 --> 00:00:18,500
with the unreleased video

5
00:00:18,500 --> 00:00:24,912
The bond with the members they met at
the training camp

6
00:00:24,912 --> 00:00:30,912
I was so happy to receive the message of
celebration at Chobun

7
00:00:30,912 --> 00:00:37,466
The bond with the members they met at
the training camp

8
00:00:37,466 --> 00:00:40,466
What kind of training camp was it for
you two?

9
00:00:43,466 --> 00:00:45,466
The two who became new members during
their debut

10
00:00:45,466 --> 00:00:49,466
have looked back on their memories of
the training camp

11
00:00:51,466 --> 00:00:54,466
First, about the first day of training
camp

12
00:00:54,466 --> 00:00:56,466
Good morning

13
00:00:56,466 --> 00:01:00,528
In the interview right after arriving,
Yunao said

14
00:01:00,528 --> 00:01:05,528
I was nervous yesterday, I slept and
woke up.

15
00:01:05,528 --> 00:01:09,528
So I could only sleep for about 3 hours.

16
00:01:09,528 --> 00:01:19,440
It's my first time staying at a training
camp for this long, so I'm nervous.

17
00:01:19,440 --> 00:01:24,440
ーWhat does she think about this
situation?ー

18
00:01:25,440 --> 00:01:31,440
I was really nervous before I joined the
camp, and I cried for the first time at
the airport.

19
00:01:32,440 --> 00:01:36,440
I was so nervous, but I'm glad I could
overcome it.

20
00:01:37,440 --> 00:01:41,440
Emma is right after arriving at the
camp.

21
00:01:41,440 --> 00:01:49,296
Everyone is so cute, and I'm like, ーWhat
should I do?ー

22
00:01:49,296 --> 00:01:57,296
I've come this far, so I hope I can do
my best to show my best.

23
00:01:58,296 --> 00:02:06,296
ーHow did you feel about the event?ー

24
00:02:06,296 --> 00:02:12,336
I've been to a school club once, and I
went to a camp.

25
00:02:12,336 --> 00:02:15,676
I was singing Ebichu's song, 《Hand in
Hand》.

26
00:02:15,816 --> 00:02:18,276
I didn't know that song at the time.

27
00:02:18,416 --> 00:02:23,956
I knew Ebichu, and I heard the song, and
I thought, 《Hand in Hand》.

28
00:02:24,096 --> 00:02:29,056
I thought, 《Hand in Hand》! I knew him
before.

29
00:02:29,196 --> 00:02:32,656
I really wanted to be in the camp.

30
00:02:32,656 --> 00:02:38,880
I was watching the camp last year, and I
thought, 《Hand in Hand》.

31
00:02:38,880 --> 00:02:40,880
I thought it would be fun.

32
00:02:40,880 --> 00:02:44,880
I've been wanting to be in the camp
since last year.

33
00:02:46,880 --> 00:02:47,880
Really?

34
00:02:47,880 --> 00:02:51,880
She was able to participate in the
audition she had been longing for.

35
00:02:51,880 --> 00:02:53,880
She was very excited from the first day.

36
00:02:54,880 --> 00:02:55,880
Good morning.

37
00:02:55,880 --> 00:02:58,880
When she actually met the members at the
camp...

38
00:02:58,880 --> 00:03:01,880
She was so thin and cute.

39
00:03:01,880 --> 00:03:06,192
At first, she was thin.

40
00:03:06,192 --> 00:03:09,192
I thought, there is a thin girl like
her.

41
00:03:10,192 --> 00:03:16,192
I was strongly motivated to be like her.

42
00:03:17,192 --> 00:03:24,192
I thought, the people who were in the
training camp a year ago would change so
much.

43
00:03:24,192 --> 00:03:27,192
I decided to do my best.

44
00:03:27,192 --> 00:03:34,192
Yuna was nervous and worked hard. She
finished her training.

45
00:03:34,656 --> 00:03:36,656
Thank you for your hard work.

46
00:03:36,656 --> 00:03:37,656
How was it?

47
00:03:37,656 --> 00:03:41,656
I was very nervous until I got there.

48
00:03:41,656 --> 00:03:44,656
But when I got there, everyone was kind.

49
00:03:44,656 --> 00:03:47,656
The training was fun.

50
00:03:47,656 --> 00:03:52,656
I'm more motivated to work hard than to
be nervous.

51
00:03:53,656 --> 00:03:58,656
I want to work hard with everyone and
appeal myself.

52
00:03:58,656 --> 00:04:03,072
Finally, she smiles.

53
00:04:03,072 --> 00:04:10,072
When they hear that it was the most
difficult training camp, they both
answer the same.

54
00:04:10,072 --> 00:04:12,912
Once again, the camp was the most...

55
00:04:12,912 --> 00:04:15,712
What was the most difficult?

56
00:04:15,852 --> 00:04:20,652
The camp was the most difficult.

57
00:04:20,792 --> 00:04:24,392
It was the hardest to remember the
moves.

58
00:04:24,532 --> 00:04:27,932
The third day was the most difficult.

59
00:04:28,072 --> 00:04:30,772
Everyone was in a state of panic.

60
00:04:30,912 --> 00:04:34,772
The atmosphere was different from the
first day.

61
00:04:34,912 --> 00:04:38,712
We were so anxious that we couldn't
remember the moves.

62
00:04:38,712 --> 00:04:43,012
It was really hard.

63
00:04:46,394 --> 00:04:49,394
Thank you for watching.

64
00:04:50,664 --> 00:04:53,044
Genero Ä McDonalds

65
00:04:53,044 --> 00:04:56,724
The blue dress is too much for me

66
00:04:56,724 --> 00:05:02,344
I want to be more and more happy in
front of you

67
00:05:02,344 --> 00:05:04,344
I'm so happy

68
00:05:04,344 --> 00:05:08,344
Ta ta ta ta ta ta ta ta

69
00:05:08,344 --> 00:05:12,344
Ta ta ta ta ta ta ta ta

70
00:05:13,344 --> 00:05:18,044
Can you see me?

71
00:05:18,044 --> 00:05:21,044
Actually, they are quite pushed into the
song

72
00:05:21,044 --> 00:05:24,044
I don't know why

73
00:05:24,044 --> 00:05:33,552
I don't remember the choreography

74
00:05:33,552 --> 00:05:38,552
I was thinking if I could sing more if I
put in more words

75
00:05:41,552 --> 00:05:46,552
At that time, I was quite cornered

76
00:05:46,552 --> 00:05:48,552
I was so frustrated that I couldn't do
it

77
00:05:48,552 --> 00:05:50,552
I was crying all the time

78
00:05:50,552 --> 00:05:52,552
I was glad I did my best

79
00:05:52,552 --> 00:06:01,552
How was the final performance?

80
00:06:01,658 --> 00:06:11,658
I want to praise myself for being calm
and dancing proudly.

81
00:06:12,480 --> 00:06:13,480
Let's go!

82
00:06:13,480 --> 00:06:14,480
Shall we dance?

83
00:06:14,480 --> 00:06:16,480
The first performance of the second day
of the training camp

84
00:06:16,480 --> 00:06:18,480
The heart beat of the girl who just
signed the contract

85
00:06:18,480 --> 00:06:21,480
I can feel it from the hand that I held

86
00:06:21,480 --> 00:06:27,480
I can't hide my feelings for you anymore

87
00:06:27,480 --> 00:06:29,480
It's hard! We're running out of time!

88
00:06:29,480 --> 00:06:31,480
We have to go back to the normal girl!

89
00:06:31,480 --> 00:06:32,480
Please!

90
00:06:32,480 --> 00:06:33,480
Please give me a smile!

91
00:06:33,480 --> 00:06:34,480
Give me a smile!

92
00:06:34,480 --> 00:06:35,480
Please give me a smile!

93
00:06:35,480 --> 00:06:39,480
The first day of the training camp

94
00:06:40,480 --> 00:06:45,480
I made some mistakes

95
00:06:45,480 --> 00:06:48,480
But I didn't feel like I was wrong

96
00:06:48,480 --> 00:06:53,664
I'm glad I was able to dance proudly

97
00:06:53,664 --> 00:06:59,664
I'm glad I was able to dance proudly

98
00:06:59,664 --> 00:07:05,164
I'm glad I was able to dance proudly

99
00:07:05,164 --> 00:07:08,664
I'm glad I was able to dance proudly

100
00:07:10,164 --> 00:07:18,164
Ah, God, please forgive me

101
00:07:18,164 --> 00:07:23,664
Because I'm forgiven

102
00:07:25,392 --> 00:07:27,392
Thank you very much

103
00:07:28,892 --> 00:07:33,692
After overcoming the training camp, they
had a great time

104
00:07:34,692 --> 00:07:37,692
Thank you for your hard work during the
training camp

105
00:07:37,692 --> 00:07:45,696
Cheers!

106
00:07:45,696 --> 00:07:47,696
Thank you.

107
00:07:47,696 --> 00:07:49,696
I'll eat it.

108
00:07:49,696 --> 00:07:51,696
I want you to eat it.

109
00:07:57,696 --> 00:07:59,696
It's really delicious.

110
00:07:59,696 --> 00:08:08,378
I can speak.

111
00:08:08,378 --> 00:08:10,378
It's very delicious

112
00:08:10,378 --> 00:08:12,378
Cute

113
00:08:12,378 --> 00:08:14,378
Very delicious

114
00:08:14,378 --> 00:08:16,378
Thank you for the meal

115
00:08:16,378 --> 00:08:18,378
Thank you for the meal

116
00:08:18,378 --> 00:08:20,378
Thank you for the meal

117
00:08:20,378 --> 00:08:22,378
I recently got a 10th grade

118
00:08:22,378 --> 00:08:24,378
Oh, no

119
00:08:24,378 --> 00:08:26,378
High school entrance exam

120
00:08:26,378 --> 00:08:30,378
After the training camp, the last thing
they talked about was

121
00:08:30,378 --> 00:08:34,032
The last thing they talked about was

122
00:08:34,032 --> 00:08:36,632
You did a great job for 4 days.

123
00:08:36,632 --> 00:08:37,832
Thank you.

124
00:08:37,832 --> 00:08:39,432
You finished everything.

125
00:08:39,432 --> 00:08:41,632
Yes, I was a bit lonely.

126
00:08:41,632 --> 00:08:44,132
I want to start over from the beginning.

127
00:08:44,132 --> 00:08:45,632
You want to start over?

128
00:08:45,632 --> 00:08:49,632
I feel like I'm done.

129
00:08:49,632 --> 00:08:55,872
I was left with the final candidate for
the new member audition.

130
00:08:56,012 --> 00:08:59,512
I had a chance to be a new member.

131
00:08:59,652 --> 00:09:02,212
I don't want to go back to reality.

132
00:09:02,352 --> 00:09:05,852
I don't want to go back to school after
summer vacation.

133
00:09:05,992 --> 00:09:11,292
I'll do what I can do until the end
without running away.

134
00:09:11,432 --> 00:09:13,492
That's what I want to learn.

135
00:09:13,632 --> 00:09:17,932
If something bad happens, I'll quit.

136
00:09:17,932 --> 00:09:19,200
Thank you.

137
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:24,640
I had to work hard to get to the top.

138
00:09:24,780 --> 00:09:33,820
But I think that's the biggest thing I
gained from training.

139
00:09:33,960 --> 00:09:40,560
If I could be like AB-TU, I'd like to
smile like the other members.

140
00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:48,480
I want to smile like AB-TU and deliver
my smile to many people.

141
00:09:50,060 --> 00:09:52,060
I think I did my best.

142
00:09:54,060 --> 00:09:56,060
Thank you for your hard work.

143
00:09:56,060 --> 00:09:58,060
How was your 4 days?

144
00:10:00,060 --> 00:10:04,060
I think my 4 days were really short.

145
00:10:04,060 --> 00:10:06,060
I think I woke up yesterday.

146
00:10:06,060 --> 00:10:08,060
It was a really tough day.

147
00:10:08,060 --> 00:10:10,060
I think it was such a day.

148
00:10:11,060 --> 00:10:15,060
I think I worked hard until I was
satisfied.

149
00:10:15,060 --> 00:10:19,008
I think I did my best for 4 days.

150
00:10:19,008 --> 00:10:23,008
I think I grew up.

151
00:10:23,008 --> 00:10:27,008
I didn't have to do anything more.

152
00:10:27,008 --> 00:10:31,008
I made a lot of effort.

153
00:10:31,008 --> 00:10:38,008
I want my parents to praise me when I go
home.

154
00:10:38,008 --> 00:10:42,008
I met the members of L-CHU.

155
00:10:42,008 --> 00:10:48,672
I announced it in front of the members
and the staff.

156
00:10:48,672 --> 00:10:56,312
I'm having so much fun making my partner
happy.

157
00:10:56,452 --> 00:10:59,512
I'm happy about it, too.

158
00:10:59,652 --> 00:11:05,152
I want to be like Eriku and show my
personality.

159
00:11:05,292 --> 00:11:09,232
I want to make everyone happy.

160
00:11:09,232 --> 00:11:15,504
They all helped in creating this...

161
00:11:15,504 --> 00:11:24,504
I think it was a great 4 days that
changed my life

162
00:11:24,504 --> 00:11:31,504
I got to know more people and it changed
me

163
00:11:33,504 --> 00:11:36,504
4 days that changed her life

164
00:11:36,504 --> 00:11:41,328
And many more unforgettable encounters

165
00:11:41,328 --> 00:11:46,328
And they became new members of the
private Ebisu Junior High School

166
00:11:49,328 --> 00:11:53,328
After the live broadcast, Yuna had this
incident

167
00:11:53,328 --> 00:11:55,328
Good job

168
00:11:55,328 --> 00:12:03,328
Karen-chan sent me a congratulatory
message right after the live broadcast

169
00:12:03,328 --> 00:12:09,328
Karen contacted Yuna who was in the same
unit as Yuna at the training camp

170
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:19,320
I was happy to work with the same team
for 4 days

171
00:12:19,320 --> 00:12:24,320
I think Karen will be active in other
places

172
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:28,848
I want to support her

173
00:12:28,848 --> 00:12:33,448
I didn't come here alone for the group
test

174
00:12:33,448 --> 00:12:38,248
I want to do my best for the other 8
members

175
00:12:38,248 --> 00:12:45,048
I want to be a person who can make the
other 8 members accept me

176
00:12:45,048 --> 00:12:55,548
