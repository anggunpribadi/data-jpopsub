"RING³" (Rin Rin Rin) is a YouTube chat content that cuts out the elements through the phone.
Until I try to talk, I don't know who the other person is or what the purpose is. There is only a real face, a real voice, and a real feeling here.

In the 12th installment, Hama Okamoto from OKAMOTO'S will appear for the first time. The other party on the phone is Becky, who used to co-star on a music program.
Neither a friend nor a benefactor, a phone call that can only be realized by these two people.
