1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Yakan and idol!

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:08,000
What is your favorite song?

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:13,000
I don't want to say this, but I like
listening to songs rather than singing.

4
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:17,000
I like going to various people's live
shows.

5
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,000
The other day, I was with Back Number
and Sekai Noari.

6
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:25,000
It's amazing to be able to sing in a
live show.

7
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Do you give feedback to your own stage?

8
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:35,000
I noticed something when I was doing the
interview.

9
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:41,000
I was talking about the emotions I felt
when I went to the live show.

10
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:46,000
At that time, I thought, I'm not me.

11
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:48,000
I'm not me.

12
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:54,000
I noticed it as a performer.

13
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:57,000
That's where you first noticed. I was a
performer, too.

14
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:59,000
I remembered.

15
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,000
I want to see it.

16
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:03,000
I remembered.

17
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,000
I felt like I was receiving it.

18
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:11,000
It's completely different from the side
I'm doing.

19
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:15,000
I don't mean that again, but I
remembered.

20
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,000
It's a good story.

21
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:21,000
I'm the type to focus on the lyrics.

22
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:23,000
You focus on the lyrics?

23
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:27,000
Yes. The deeper the lyrics, the deeper
the lyrics.

24
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:32,000
Do you have any lyrics that you've been
referring to when you're lost?

25
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:36,000
Recently, I thought it was good.

26
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:40,000
There's a song called Kimie by Reaction
the Buddha.

27
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:42,000
What kind of lyrics?

28
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
I'm nervous and I can't think of any
lyrics.

29
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:46,000
Please wait.

30
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:48,000
My hands are shaking.

31
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:50,000
Your hands are shaking?

32
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,000
No.

33
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:57,000
When you think about the meaning of the
lyrics, the lyrics are important to you.

34
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,000
That's right.

35
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,000
It's a great meaning for me.

36
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:07,000
I feel like I'm going first and the song
doesn't go well.

37
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
I have to fix this.

38
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
I have to fix it.

39
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:17,000
But you know the meaning of the lyrics
and the environment.

40
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
You have to deliver it.

41
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,000
That's right.

42
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,000
It's not a beautiful song.

43
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:32,000
I don't think it's a good song, but I
think I have to balance it.

44
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:37,000
I always think it's too much.

45
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,000
I want to improve it.

46
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,000
I think it's a good song for a
performer.

47
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,000
I think it's a good song for a
performer.

48
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,000
I think it's a good song for a
performer.

49
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
I want to deliver the song.

50
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,000
I want to deliver the song.

51
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,000
That's a good word.

52
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,000
Don't use it as a good word.

53
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,000
I'm sure you shouldn't.

54
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,000
What kind of job is it?

55
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,000
I think it's a job that can do that.

56
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,000
I just thought you were a manager.

57
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,000
That's right.

58
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,000
I don't know what to say.

59
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:35,000
I'm sorry.
