Mirei Sasaki and Ayaka Takamoto went sea fishing to Kashima Old Port in Ibaraki Prefecture! This time, 4th gen member Mitsuki Hiraoka, whose father is a fisherman, will be participating as a helper!

We will sail to the sea in the middle of winter aiming for high quality fish, flounder â™ª

Will the three of them be able to catch a flounder? ?
Ayaka Takamoto will handle the fish she catches with her own knife!

Please take a look!
