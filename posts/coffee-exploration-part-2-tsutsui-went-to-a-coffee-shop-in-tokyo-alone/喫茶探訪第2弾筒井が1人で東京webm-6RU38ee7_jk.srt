00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Hello, I'm Ayame Tsutsui.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:07,000
This is the second episode of the cafe.

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:12,000
Last time, I went to a cafe in Nagoya.

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,000
Today, I'm going to Tokyo.

5
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:24,000
I'm going to a cafe called Coffee Save
in Nishi-Shinjuku.

6
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:30,000
I'm going to a cafe called Coffee Save
in Nishi-Shinjuku.

7
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,658
Thank you for watching.

8
00:00:33,658 --> 00:00:42,658
I'm alone today, so I'm a little
nervous.

9
00:00:42,658 --> 00:00:44,658
I'm sorry to bother you.

10
00:00:44,658 --> 00:00:45,658
Welcome.

11
00:00:45,658 --> 00:00:46,658
One person?

12
00:00:46,658 --> 00:00:47,658
Yes, one person.

13
00:00:47,658 --> 00:00:48,658
Please take your seat.

14
00:00:48,658 --> 00:00:49,658
Thank you.

15
00:00:49,658 --> 00:00:52,658
Wow, it's nice.

16
00:00:53,658 --> 00:00:55,658
This glass is nice.

17
00:00:55,658 --> 00:00:57,658
What should I do?

18
00:00:57,658 --> 00:00:58,658
Here?

19
00:00:58,658 --> 00:01:01,658
Excuse me.

20
00:01:04,408 --> 00:01:06,408
It's like a cafe.

21
00:01:12,408 --> 00:01:13,408
There are so many.

22
00:01:18,408 --> 00:01:20,408
I like this.

23
00:01:20,408 --> 00:01:22,408
It looks delicious.

24
00:01:22,408 --> 00:01:29,408
What should I do?

25
00:01:30,664 --> 00:01:32,664
I often see this, omurice.

26
00:01:33,664 --> 00:01:34,664
It's nice.

27
00:01:36,664 --> 00:01:37,664
Like this?

28
00:01:37,664 --> 00:01:38,664
I don't know.

29
00:01:38,664 --> 00:01:39,664
I don't know.

30
00:01:39,664 --> 00:01:40,664
I don't know.

31
00:01:48,474 --> 00:01:56,474
I was always curious about parfaits, so
I'm going to order one.

32
00:01:56,474 --> 00:02:05,744
I can drink black coffee now.

33
00:02:06,744 --> 00:02:08,744
I'll take it.

34
00:02:09,744 --> 00:02:10,744
I've decided.

35
00:02:10,744 --> 00:02:11,744
Thank you.

36
00:02:13,744 --> 00:02:14,744
I'll take it.

37
00:02:14,744 --> 00:02:18,744
I'll have a parfait and a drink.

38
00:02:18,744 --> 00:02:20,744
American coffee.

39
00:02:20,744 --> 00:02:21,744
Hot coffee?

40
00:02:21,744 --> 00:02:22,744
Yes, hot coffee.

41
00:02:22,744 --> 00:02:23,744
Thank you.

42
00:02:23,744 --> 00:02:25,744
I'll bring you a drink first.

43
00:02:25,744 --> 00:02:26,744
Thank you.

44
00:02:26,744 --> 00:02:32,744
Thank you.

45
00:02:33,928 --> 00:02:40,928
I searched this cafe and cafeteria in
Tokyo

46
00:02:41,928 --> 00:02:43,928
and I watched a lot of videos.

47
00:02:44,928 --> 00:02:47,928
I watched a lot of cafes and cafes,

48
00:02:47,928 --> 00:02:49,928
so I was finally able to come here.

49
00:02:49,928 --> 00:02:51,928
I'm so happy.

50
00:02:51,928 --> 00:02:57,928
I'm so happy.

51
00:02:57,968 --> 00:03:03,968
I brought my camera, so I'm going to
take a lot of pictures.

52
00:03:10,842 --> 00:03:12,842
I'll see you in the next video.

53
00:03:12,842 --> 00:03:19,450
Thank you for watching.

54
00:03:19,450 --> 00:03:21,450
I'm going to take a picture.

55
00:03:21,450 --> 00:03:31,450
What did you do during the New Year's
holiday?

56
00:03:32,760 --> 00:03:38,760
I went to a one-night onsen with my
family.

57
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:43,760
We had a barbecue and went to a shrine.

58
00:03:44,760 --> 00:03:47,760
We got lucky and got to go to Chukichi.

59
00:03:48,760 --> 00:03:50,760
Last year, we went to Kyoto.

60
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:54,760
This year, we're going to Chukichi.

61
00:03:55,760 --> 00:03:58,760
It's the best place.

62
00:03:58,760 --> 00:04:04,760
I'm worried that I'm too good if I'm
alone.

63
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:07,760
Chukichi is the best line.

64
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:11,738
I'm not going to leave today.

65
00:04:11,738 --> 00:04:12,738
Here you go.

66
00:04:12,738 --> 00:04:13,738
Thank you.

67
00:04:13,738 --> 00:04:14,738
I'll have the Americano first.

68
00:04:14,738 --> 00:04:16,738
Thank you.

69
00:04:17,738 --> 00:04:18,738
Thank you.

70
00:04:19,738 --> 00:04:20,738
Wow.

71
00:04:21,738 --> 00:04:22,738
Ta-da.

72
00:04:24,738 --> 00:04:27,738
I'll eat it right away.

73
00:04:29,738 --> 00:04:30,738
It looks delicious.

74
00:04:33,738 --> 00:04:34,738
It's delicious.

75
00:04:34,738 --> 00:04:39,738
I'm happy.

76
00:04:51,770 --> 00:04:53,770
I wonder if it's recording?

77
00:04:53,770 --> 00:05:01,770
The photo I took at the cafe in Naoya
last time was too dark

78
00:05:01,770 --> 00:05:07,770
I can use a flash but I'm not sure

79
00:05:07,770 --> 00:05:11,770
I'll try this

80
00:05:16,770 --> 00:05:19,770
Did it work?

81
00:05:19,770 --> 00:05:21,770
Yes

82
00:05:23,080 --> 00:05:24,080
It's hot.

83
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:27,080
I'll put it on top.

84
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:33,080
It's a little...

85
00:05:33,080 --> 00:05:34,080
It's hot.

86
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:47,034
Please subscribe to my channel.

87
00:05:47,034 --> 00:05:56,034
I usually stay at a cafe and just sit
there.

88
00:05:56,034 --> 00:06:00,034
But I try not to touch my phone.

89
00:06:00,034 --> 00:06:03,632
I like to play with my grandmother and
stuff.

90
00:06:04,632 --> 00:06:07,632
I watch my grandmother and grandfather.

91
00:06:08,632 --> 00:06:10,632
I often watch them.

92
00:06:11,632 --> 00:06:13,632
It's healing.

93
00:06:14,632 --> 00:06:16,632
I remember now.

94
00:06:17,632 --> 00:06:19,632
I often go to my hometown.

95
00:06:20,632 --> 00:06:22,632
Oh, my God.

96
00:06:23,632 --> 00:06:25,632
Thank you for waiting.

97
00:06:26,632 --> 00:06:28,632
Here's the soup.

98
00:06:28,632 --> 00:06:30,632
I'll go to the bathroom.

99
00:06:33,096 --> 00:06:34,096
It's big!

100
00:06:35,096 --> 00:06:36,096
Ta-da!

101
00:06:37,096 --> 00:06:42,096
Wow, it's like ice cream on top of a
parfait.

102
00:06:43,096 --> 00:06:47,096
It's bigger than I imagined.

103
00:06:48,096 --> 00:06:50,096
It looks delicious!

104
00:06:51,096 --> 00:06:52,096
Let's take a picture.

105
00:06:53,096 --> 00:06:54,096
I'll take a picture.

106
00:06:54,096 --> 00:07:00,096
I'll take a picture.

107
00:07:01,184 --> 00:07:03,184
Thank you.

108
00:07:10,650 --> 00:07:12,650
Itadakimasu!

109
00:07:12,650 --> 00:07:14,650
Where should I start?

110
00:07:14,650 --> 00:07:17,650
It's morning, so I'll eat some fruit.

111
00:07:17,650 --> 00:07:19,650
Bananas?

112
00:07:23,650 --> 00:07:25,650
Let's start with the banana.

113
00:07:26,650 --> 00:07:28,650
Here I go.

114
00:07:33,650 --> 00:07:35,650
Mmm.

115
00:07:35,650 --> 00:07:37,650
It's so good.

116
00:07:37,650 --> 00:07:38,880
Mmm.

117
00:07:39,880 --> 00:07:40,880
It's so good.

118
00:07:49,880 --> 00:07:50,880
Wow.

119
00:07:52,880 --> 00:07:54,880
There's a lot of cream.

120
00:07:56,880 --> 00:07:57,880
It's so good.

121
00:07:57,880 --> 00:07:58,880
It's so good.

122
00:08:02,880 --> 00:08:03,880
It's so good.

124
00:08:09,736 --> 00:08:12,736
Do they all eat by themselves?

125
00:08:14,736 --> 00:08:17,736
There is ice cream inside.

126
00:08:17,736 --> 00:08:18,736
Wow.

127
00:08:19,736 --> 00:08:20,736
Ice cream. Ice cream.

128
00:08:22,736 --> 00:08:24,736
This is ice cream.

129
00:08:24,736 --> 00:08:30,736
It's delicious.

130
00:08:32,736 --> 00:08:34,736
It's vanilla ice cream.

131
00:08:34,736 --> 00:08:38,624
Wow.

132
00:08:38,624 --> 00:08:43,964
Delicious.

133
00:08:46,938 --> 00:08:50,198
delicious

134
00:09:04,986 --> 00:09:11,986
I'm turning 23 this year.

135
00:09:11,986 --> 00:09:15,986
I'm graduating from high school this
year.

136
00:09:15,986 --> 00:09:23,986
I was surprised that I was not a student

137
00:09:23,986 --> 00:09:33,986
when I was a high school student.

138
00:09:34,042 --> 00:09:41,042
I wanted to do it when I was in high
school.

139
00:09:43,400 --> 00:09:49,400
I went to Disneyland last year with Rei
Seimiya,

140
00:09:49,400 --> 00:09:53,400
so I can graduate without any regrets.

141
00:09:54,400 --> 00:09:59,400
I was told that I was not a high school
student,

142
00:09:59,400 --> 00:10:06,400
so I was rejected because I was not good
at it.

143
00:10:06,400 --> 00:10:13,400
But I finally got an OK and went to
Disneyland.

144
00:10:16,376 --> 00:10:28,376
I went to the store to borrow a uniform
in the morning.

145
00:10:28,376 --> 00:10:33,152
It was a great day.

146
00:10:34,152 --> 00:10:40,152
I met Rika Sato and Eno-san at
Disneyland.

147
00:10:41,152 --> 00:10:46,152
I was surprised to meet them among tens
of thousands of people.

148
00:10:47,152 --> 00:10:50,152
What is your goal for this year?

149
00:10:51,152 --> 00:10:53,152
This year,

150
00:10:53,152 --> 00:11:00,152
I want to travel alone.

151
00:11:04,154 --> 00:11:09,154
I want to travel around Japan by myself.

152
00:11:10,154 --> 00:11:13,154
It's okay if I don't travel alone.

153
00:11:17,154 --> 00:11:22,154
I like traveling alone, so I want to
travel around.

154
00:11:22,154 --> 00:11:29,936
I want to know what you live in and what
you recommend.

155
00:11:30,936 --> 00:11:35,936
I want to go to a popular shop on the
internet,

156
00:11:36,936 --> 00:11:42,936
but I also want to go to a shop that
people in my hometown know.

157
00:11:42,936 --> 00:11:54,936
I want to go to a shop that people in my
hometown know and recommend.

158
00:11:55,930 --> 00:11:59,610
I don't know what she says..

159
00:12:11,546 --> 00:12:17,546
I want to take pictures of the food I'm
about to eat.

160
00:12:17,546 --> 00:12:33,546
I like ice cream.

161
00:12:41,946 --> 00:12:44,946
How do you dive into sea?

162
00:12:53,466 --> 00:12:59,466
I think I can do this for about an hour.

163
00:13:04,794 --> 00:13:06,794
The last bite.

164
00:13:06,794 --> 00:13:08,794
Itadakimasu.

165
00:13:12,794 --> 00:13:14,794
I ate it.

166
00:13:16,794 --> 00:13:18,794
It was so big.

167
00:13:18,794 --> 00:13:20,794
I ate it.

168
00:13:24,794 --> 00:13:26,794
It's amazing.

169
00:13:26,794 --> 00:13:41,794
Please subscribe to my channel.

170
00:13:42,522 --> 00:13:44,522
It's so good.

171
00:13:46,522 --> 00:13:48,522
I love coffee.

172
00:13:51,522 --> 00:13:53,522
I drink it every morning.

173
00:13:53,522 --> 00:14:10,458
I'm an adult.

174
00:14:10,458 --> 00:14:12,458
It was delicious.

175
00:14:17,458 --> 00:14:19,458
I'm happy.

176
00:14:21,458 --> 00:14:24,458
I decided a good start of the day.

177
00:14:25,458 --> 00:14:26,458
It was delicious.

178
00:14:27,458 --> 00:14:30,458
I'm going to go home.

179
00:14:30,458 --> 00:14:34,458
I'm going to go home.

180
00:14:34,458 --> 00:14:37,648
Gochisousamadesita.

181
00:14:38,648 --> 00:14:40,648
Please take care of me.

182
00:14:41,648 --> 00:14:44,648
Thank you for the meal.

183
00:14:45,648 --> 00:14:52,648
I felt happy with a wonderful atmosphere
this time as well.

184
00:14:53,648 --> 00:14:56,648
I hope I can come again next time.

185
00:14:57,648 --> 00:15:02,648
I hope someone like Rei-chan will come
with me next time.

186
00:15:02,648 --> 00:15:06,648
