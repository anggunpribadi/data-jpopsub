WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:02.000
 Now, it's started!

00:02.000 --> 00:09.000
 This is TOKIMEKI BALLON METAL JASHOW
TV!

00:10.722 --> 00:11.722
 We are back!

00:12.722 --> 00:13.722
 What are we doing today?

00:14.722 --> 00:15.722
 What are we doing this week?

00:16.722 --> 00:19.722
 This week, we are going to do...

00:21.722 --> 00:25.722
 This week, we are going to do the
Akichan King Final!

00:28.722 --> 00:30.722
 We had a fair competition last time.

00:31.722 --> 00:33.722
 Are you confident?

00:33.722 --> 00:35.722
 We are going to do the Akichan King
Final!

00:37.722 --> 00:39.722
 We were in a tight spot last time.

00:40.722 --> 00:42.722
 I hope we can do well this time.

00:43.722 --> 00:46.722
 Kanami, please explain the rules.

00:47.722 --> 00:52.722
 We are going to ask Akichan a lot of
questions.

00:53.722 --> 00:55.722
 Akichan has already answered the
questions.

00:55.722 --> 01:02.722
 We are going to think about the answer
and answer it.

01:03.722 --> 01:04.722
 And...

01:05.722 --> 01:12.722
 We will give you the point for the
correct answer.

01:13.722 --> 01:14.722
 Cute!

01:15.722 --> 01:16.722
 I'm Tsuda.

01:16.722 --> 01:27.722
 Unfortunately, the person who didn't
get the point is going to be punished.

01:28.722 --> 01:29.722
 Who is going to be punished?

01:30.722 --> 01:33.722
 Last time, we did the Akichan King
Final.

01:36.722 --> 01:40.722
 We did the Akichan King Final with a
lot of mistakes.

01:40.722 --> 01:45.722
 We are going to think about the point
of the word.

01:46.722 --> 01:47.722
 I'm Kanami.

01:48.722 --> 01:51.722
 Kanami is going to do her best to make
the word.

01:52.722 --> 01:54.722
 It's a little difficult.

01:55.722 --> 01:57.722
 I can't say it if it's a tongue
twister.

01:58.722 --> 02:04.722
 I'm going to do my best to make the
word.

02:04.722 --> 02:09.722
 Let's do it!

02:43.834 --> 02:45.834
 Here we go.

02:45.834 --> 02:47.834
 The first one.

02:50.834 --> 02:52.834
 What is your favorite hairstyle?

02:52.834 --> 02:54.834
 Now?

02:54.834 --> 02:56.834
 I don't know.

02:56.834 --> 02:58.834
 Not the length.

02:58.834 --> 03:00.834
 Now?

03:00.834 --> 03:02.834
 Hair style.

03:02.834 --> 03:04.834
 Now?

03:04.834 --> 03:06.834
 Now?

03:06.834 --> 03:08.834
 Simple.

03:08.834 --> 03:10.834
 Simple?

03:10.834 --> 03:12.834
 I got it.

03:12.834 --> 03:14.834
 Is it simple?

03:14.834 --> 03:15.834
 Yes.

03:15.834 --> 03:17.834
 It's a hairstyle, isn't it?

03:17.834 --> 03:19.834
 I often do it.

03:23.144 --> 03:25.144
 Maybe it's not Aki-chan and IEVA.

03:25.144 --> 03:26.144
 It's not!

03:26.144 --> 03:28.144
 Then, it might be wrong.

03:28.144 --> 03:29.144
 I don't know.

03:31.144 --> 03:32.144
 Simple?

03:32.144 --> 03:34.144
 I can't say the answer.

03:39.144 --> 03:41.144
 If you say simple...

03:43.144 --> 03:45.144
 I think I know.

03:45.144 --> 03:47.144
 I think I know, too.

03:47.144 --> 03:48.144
 I think so, too.

03:49.144 --> 03:50.144
 Time up!

03:53.144 --> 03:56.144
 Please read the question in order.

03:56.144 --> 03:58.144
 What is the name of the Japanese singer
who sang the song of the same name?

03:58.144 --> 03:59.144
 Ponytail.

04:00.144 --> 04:01.144
 Ponytail.

04:01.144 --> 04:02.144
 Ponyodan.

04:02.144 --> 04:03.144
 Ponytail.

04:04.144 --> 04:05.144
 That's all.

04:07.144 --> 04:08.144
 I thought it was Ponyodan.

04:08.144 --> 04:10.144
 I saw the picture, but I couldn't
remember.

04:10.144 --> 04:12.144
 I don't think it's the same.

04:12.144 --> 04:14.144
 I used to be Pony.

04:14.144 --> 04:15.144
 What's that illustration?

04:15.144 --> 04:16.144
 I like Pony.

04:16.144 --> 04:17.144
 I like that illustration.

04:17.144 --> 04:18.144
 I like Odan...

04:18.144 --> 04:20.144
 No, Odan.

04:21.144 --> 04:22.144
 I like Odan.

04:22.144 --> 04:23.144
 I like Shinbun.

04:23.144 --> 04:25.144
 I like Asuka.

04:25.144 --> 04:27.144
 I haven't done it recently.

04:27.144 --> 04:30.144
 I did it with Less and Pony.

04:30.144 --> 04:31.144
 Less and Pony.

04:31.144 --> 04:33.144
 I like Pony, too.

04:33.144 --> 04:34.144
 I like Pony, too.

04:36.144 --> 04:37.144
 It's wrong!

04:37.144 --> 04:39.144
 Pony 5 is wrong.

04:39.144 --> 04:40.144
 Let's go to the next question.

04:40.144 --> 04:42.992
 Please look forward to the next video.

04:43.992 --> 04:46.992
 What is your favorite hairstyle?

04:46.992 --> 04:50.992
 My favorite hairstyle is...

04:54.288 --> 04:56.288
 Drawing with Cameras!

04:59.148 --> 05:03.248
 Juri seems confident because she's
drawing most of the thing at the end but

05:03.248 --> 05:04.788
 the liberties are not really as
Clarissa's aixÃ­

05:04.788 --> 05:06.308
 It would be nice to use a full-on style

05:06.308 --> 05:07.748
 I'm not sure

05:08.228 --> 05:10.228
 Speaking of areas Seriousness

05:13.348 --> 05:16.348
 Everyone got 10 with the large Giulia

05:16.348 --> 05:17.808
 It's a massacre

05:17.808 --> 05:24.648
 So the tie-breakers are ZERO.

05:24.648 --> 05:26.648
 Please do your best!

05:30.970 --> 05:31.970
 Next time

05:31.970 --> 05:33.970
 Here is the second question

05:34.970 --> 05:37.970
 What is the song that Aki-chan listens
to the most?

05:39.970 --> 05:41.970
 The hint is that it's a recent song

05:41.970 --> 05:42.970
 What?

05:42.970 --> 05:45.664
 Will this song come out?

05:46.664 --> 05:47.664
 Recently?

05:47.664 --> 05:48.664
 Recently!

05:48.664 --> 05:49.664
 Recently!

05:49.664 --> 05:50.664
 If you say recently, it's not that.

05:50.664 --> 05:51.664
 I got it.

05:51.664 --> 05:53.664
 Then, isn't it only this?

05:53.664 --> 05:54.664
 What?

05:55.664 --> 05:56.664
 What?

05:56.664 --> 05:57.664
 Wide-span recently.

05:57.664 --> 05:58.664
 Wide-span...

05:58.664 --> 06:00.664
 Then, it's not this.

06:02.664 --> 06:03.664
 Isn't it this?

06:03.664 --> 06:05.664
 If you say recently, it's only this.

06:05.664 --> 06:06.664
 Recently...

06:06.664 --> 06:07.664
 That's what you mean, right?

06:07.664 --> 06:09.664
 What do you mean?

06:09.664 --> 06:10.664
 What do you mean?

06:10.664 --> 06:11.664
 Do you know?

06:11.664 --> 06:12.664
 I think I know.

06:12.664 --> 06:13.664
 It's the same.

06:13.664 --> 06:14.664
 I think so, too.

06:16.440 --> 06:17.440
 I think I know.

06:20.440 --> 06:21.440
 I think so, too.

06:21.440 --> 06:23.440
 What are you listening to?

06:24.440 --> 06:26.440
 I'm listening to a different song.

06:29.440 --> 06:30.440
 Are you ready?

06:30.440 --> 06:31.440
 July, was it?

06:31.440 --> 06:33.338
 Keep your time.

06:33.338 --> 06:35.338
 I like it!

06:35.338 --> 06:37.338
 July cider!

06:37.338 --> 06:39.338
 But it's time to sing!

06:39.338 --> 06:41.338
 It's time!

06:41.338 --> 06:43.338
 I'll do my best!

06:43.338 --> 06:45.338
 I'll do my best!

06:45.338 --> 06:47.338
 Please!

06:49.104 --> 06:52.604
 What is your favorite song?

06:52.604 --> 06:55.604
 My favorite song is...

06:55.604 --> 07:00.604
 I recently listen to Sukio!

07:04.604 --> 07:06.604
 How long have you been listening to it?

07:06.604 --> 07:09.604
 I've been listening to it a lot
recently.

07:09.604 --> 07:10.604
 I like it!

07:10.604 --> 07:11.604
 Yay!

07:11.604 --> 07:13.604
 I like Sukio!

07:13.604 --> 07:14.604
 Yay!

07:14.604 --> 07:18.288
 I like Sukio!

07:18.288 --> 07:20.448
 Mochimochi ~!

07:31.994 --> 07:35.994
 Let's move on to the third question.

07:35.994 --> 07:40.994
 What did Aki-chan eat for dinner?

07:40.994 --> 07:43.994
 This is hard!

07:43.994 --> 07:45.994
 I have a hint.

07:45.994 --> 07:47.994
 A hint?

07:47.994 --> 07:49.994
 My daily life.

07:49.994 --> 07:51.994
 I think I know.

07:51.994 --> 07:53.994
 My daily life.

07:53.994 --> 07:54.994
 I think I know.

07:56.168 --> 07:57.168
 What about Aki-chan?

07:57.168 --> 07:59.168
 Did you say that on Aki-chan's YouTube
channel?

07:59.168 --> 08:00.168
 No, I didn't.

08:00.168 --> 08:01.168
 Then, you should say that.

08:03.168 --> 08:04.168
 Daily life?

08:04.168 --> 08:05.168
 What is it?

08:06.168 --> 08:07.168
 Always...

08:08.168 --> 08:09.168
 Always...

08:09.168 --> 08:10.168
 It's not always like this.

08:10.168 --> 08:11.168
 What is it?

08:11.168 --> 08:12.168
 Let's do this.

08:13.168 --> 08:14.168
 Maybe it's a school day.

08:14.168 --> 08:15.168
 Maybe it's a school day.

08:16.168 --> 08:18.168
 I'm like that.

08:19.168 --> 08:20.168
 I'm like that.

08:20.168 --> 08:21.168
 I don't know.

08:21.168 --> 08:22.168
 What is that?

08:22.168 --> 08:23.168
 I don't know.

08:23.168 --> 08:25.168
 Do you eat it at school?

08:26.168 --> 08:27.168
 Do you eat it at school?

08:29.168 --> 08:30.168
 I don't know.

08:30.168 --> 08:32.168
 It's not interesting.

08:36.168 --> 08:37.168
 It's not interesting at all.

08:39.168 --> 08:42.168
 I've got two questions.

08:43.168 --> 08:45.168
 I'm not confident.

08:47.168 --> 08:48.168
 What?

08:48.168 --> 08:49.168
 Shall we start?

08:49.168 --> 08:50.168
 Shall we start?

08:50.168 --> 08:51.168
 Let's start.

08:51.168 --> 08:52.168
 Let's start.

08:52.168 --> 08:53.168
 Let's start.

08:54.168 --> 08:55.168
 What do you eat at school?

08:55.168 --> 08:56.168
 I don't eat it.

08:57.168 --> 08:58.168
 I don't eat it, either.

08:58.168 --> 08:59.168
 Bread.

08:59.168 --> 09:00.168
 Meat.

09:00.168 --> 09:01.168
 I like all of them.

09:02.168 --> 09:03.168
 I like meat.

09:03.168 --> 09:05.168
 You're saying all of them are
different.

09:06.168 --> 09:07.168
 You're saying all of them are
different.

09:08.168 --> 09:09.168
 Let's start.

09:09.168 --> 09:10.168
 Let's start.

09:10.168 --> 09:13.520
 Please watch this video and follow us
on Twitter!

09:14.520 --> 09:16.520
 What did you eat for breakfast?

09:16.520 --> 09:22.520
 I didn't eat anything!

09:25.882 --> 09:27.882
 Awesome

09:27.882 --> 09:32.402
 That's amazing. Good thing Giri zo
Sugar wouldn't come.

09:33.142 --> 09:35.142
 This was so weird.

09:35.142 --> 09:36.962
 Yeah, I found it terrible.

09:37.782 --> 09:40.722
 You Iont know what gigs would Iike.

09:40.722 --> 09:42.722
 I eat all the time.

09:42.722 --> 09:44.722
 Come on, you used to gibiibo?

09:45.362 --> 09:47.082
 Dice would be great.

09:49.822 --> 09:52.322
 I used to sit in front of the mirror on
stage.

09:53.362 --> 09:55.362
 Yes, like a superhero.

09:55.362 --> 09:57.362
 It's my first time to come here.

09:57.362 --> 09:59.362
 It's been a while.

10:02.944 --> 10:04.944
 Next, let's go to the fourth question.

10:04.944 --> 10:06.944
 This is bad, I can't get it at all.

10:06.944 --> 10:08.944
 This is the fourth question.

10:08.944 --> 10:10.944
 What is Aki's favorite Pokemon?

10:10.944 --> 10:12.944
 I don't know.

10:12.944 --> 10:14.944
 This is difficult.

10:14.944 --> 10:16.944
 I don't know.

10:16.944 --> 10:18.944
 I don't know.

10:18.944 --> 10:20.944
 Isn't that a Pokemon?

10:22.944 --> 10:24.944
 I don't know.

10:24.944 --> 10:26.944
 I don't know the name of the Pokemon.

10:26.944 --> 10:28.944
 I don't know the name of the Pokemon.

10:28.944 --> 10:30.496
 I don't know the name of the Pokemon.

10:31.496 --> 10:33.496
 I don't know the name of the Pokemon.

10:33.496 --> 10:35.496
 Can I say the first character?

10:36.496 --> 10:38.496
 I know what you like.

10:38.496 --> 10:39.496
 Do you?

10:39.496 --> 10:40.496
 I like Pokemon.

10:40.496 --> 10:42.496
 Wait, wait, wait.

10:43.496 --> 10:45.496
 I like Pokemon.

10:45.496 --> 10:47.496
 But you said it in the video of the
infinite dynamo.

10:49.496 --> 10:51.496
 Wait, do you really know?

10:52.496 --> 10:54.496
 I've been playing Pokemon lately.

10:54.496 --> 10:56.496
 I'm playing with electric current.

10:56.496 --> 10:58.496
 I'm playing with electric current.

10:58.496 --> 11:00.496
 What are you talking about?

11:00.496 --> 11:01.496
 Wait, wait.

11:01.496 --> 11:03.496
 I'm talking about my extra story.

11:08.168 --> 11:10.168
 What is the name of the character in

11:10.168 --> 11:11.168
 It's a mystery.

11:11.168 --> 11:12.168
 Pochama.

11:12.168 --> 11:13.168
 Pochama?

11:16.168 --> 11:17.168
 Pochama.

11:17.168 --> 11:18.168
 Pochama.

11:18.168 --> 11:19.168
 Pochama?

11:21.168 --> 11:22.168
 Who is Pochama?

11:23.168 --> 11:24.168
 It's funny.

11:26.168 --> 11:28.168
 I feel like I became a hero.

 What is your favorite Pokemon?

11:37.816 --> 11:39.816
 My favorite Pokemon is Mew!

11:40.816 --> 11:41.816
 I like Mew!

11:41.816 --> 11:42.816
 It's a new one.

11:42.816 --> 11:43.816
 I've never heard of it.

11:43.816 --> 11:44.816
 I've seen it in a movie.

11:44.816 --> 11:45.816
 It's a movie.

11:45.816 --> 11:46.816
 Mew!

11:47.816 --> 11:48.816
 Mew!

11:50.816 --> 11:53.816
 I want to talk, but this is coming
slowly.

12:04.922 --> 12:06.922
 Next, the fifth question.

12:06.922 --> 12:08.922
 This is difficult.

12:08.922 --> 12:10.922
 This is difficult.

12:10.922 --> 12:12.922
 Aki-chan, this is difficult.

12:12.922 --> 12:14.922
 I have information I don't know.

12:14.922 --> 12:16.922
 Next, this is easy.

12:16.922 --> 12:22.922
 What is the height of Aki-chan's body
measured by the star graph?

12:22.922 --> 12:26.922
 This is easy.

12:27.992 --> 12:31.992
 What is the length of the wall?

12:31.992 --> 12:33.992
 I don't know.

12:33.992 --> 12:35.992
 How long is the wall?

12:35.992 --> 12:38.992
 About the same length as the mirror.

12:38.992 --> 12:40.992
 How long is the wall?

12:40.992 --> 12:42.992
 I can answer that.

12:42.992 --> 12:44.992
 How long is the wall?

12:44.992 --> 12:47.992
 It is about the ceiling.

12:47.992 --> 12:49.992
 Is it the ceiling?

12:49.992 --> 12:51.992
 Is the wall long?

12:51.992 --> 12:54.992
 How long is the wall?

12:54.992 --> 12:56.992
 How long is the wall?

12:56.992 --> 12:58.992
 How long is the wall?

12:58.992 --> 13:00.992
 It is about the same length as the
wall.

13:00.992 --> 13:02.992
 Is it the same length?

13:02.992 --> 13:04.992
 Is it the same length?

13:04.992 --> 13:06.992
 Is it the same length?

13:06.992 --> 13:08.992
 I think so.

13:08.992 --> 13:10.992
 It may be different.

13:10.992 --> 13:12.992
 I am not confident.

13:12.992 --> 13:14.992
 It is not small.

13:14.992 --> 13:18.992
 Is it the same length?

13:19.008 --> 13:21.008
 I don't think so.

13:21.008 --> 13:23.008
 The answer is...

13:23.008 --> 13:25.008
 What is it?

13:25.008 --> 13:27.008
 Please show us the answer.

13:29.008 --> 13:31.008
 153.5 cm.

13:31.008 --> 13:33.008
 That's small.

13:33.008 --> 13:35.008
 I'm 151 cm.

13:35.008 --> 13:37.008
 154.5 cm.

13:37.008 --> 13:39.008
 154.5 cm.

13:39.008 --> 13:41.008
 153.5 cm.

13:41.008 --> 13:43.008
 She's bigger than me.

13:43.008 --> 13:45.008
 I'm 154.1 cm.

13:45.008 --> 13:47.008
 Why didn't you tell me?

13:47.008 --> 13:48.282
 I'm sorry.

13:48.282 --> 13:50.282
 I'm here!

13:50.282 --> 13:53.282
 Did you get the answer?

13:53.282 --> 13:55.282
 Please look at the QR code.

13:57.282 --> 14:02.282
 How tall is Aki's height in the
official profile of Stardust?

14:02.282 --> 14:05.282
 153.5 cm!

14:05.282 --> 14:10.282
 I'm pretty tall, so I'm sure everyone
is right.

14:10.282 --> 14:13.744
 See you next time!

14:14.744 --> 14:16.744
 You're so excited!

14:16.744 --> 14:18.744
 You're so excited!

14:18.744 --> 14:20.744
 You're so excited!

14:20.744 --> 14:22.744
 I didn't think you'd be so excited.

14:23.744 --> 14:25.744
 But I guess you got used to it.

14:25.744 --> 14:31.482
 That's all.

14:31.482 --> 14:33.482
 Ruru!

14:33.482 --> 14:34.482
 Oh no.

14:34.482 --> 14:35.482
 The sixth question.

14:35.482 --> 14:37.482
 What is Aki's favorite color?

14:37.482 --> 14:38.482
 Oh no.

14:38.482 --> 14:41.482
 I believe you.

14:43.482 --> 14:45.482
 Wait, which one is it?

14:45.482 --> 14:47.482
 I have a feeling.

14:47.482 --> 14:50.482
 I can only think of one.

14:50.482 --> 14:52.482
 What?

14:52.482 --> 14:55.482
 Wait, which one?

14:55.482 --> 14:58.482
 I think I know.

14:58.482 --> 15:01.482
 What?

15:01.482 --> 15:03.482
 But I can write it down.

15:03.482 --> 15:04.482
 What?

15:04.482 --> 15:06.482
 I can't decide.

15:06.482 --> 15:07.482
 I can't.

15:07.482 --> 15:10.482
 I'm going to be a punishment.

15:10.482 --> 15:12.816
 One.

15:13.076 --> 15:14.076
 Ageless.

15:14.076 --> 15:16.076
 Yes, yes.

15:16.076 --> 15:18.076
 Oh, that's what you mean.

15:18.076 --> 15:19.696
 Bearable

15:20.872 --> 15:22.872
 Haru is betting on Shizuya.

15:23.872 --> 15:25.872
 Wait, what should I do?

15:26.872 --> 15:28.872
 I don't want to do this.

15:28.872 --> 15:30.872
 Haru, you haven't won anything yet.

15:30.872 --> 15:32.872
 I haven't won anything yet.

15:33.872 --> 15:35.872
 My juniors are playing games with me.

15:36.872 --> 15:38.872
 My juniors are playing games with me.

15:43.872 --> 15:44.872
 White.

15:44.872 --> 15:45.872
 Black.

15:45.872 --> 15:46.872
 Light blue.

15:46.872 --> 15:47.872
 I won!

15:47.872 --> 15:48.872
 I lost.

15:49.872 --> 15:51.872
 I was confused between white and black.

15:51.872 --> 15:52.872
 I was confused between light blue and
white.

15:52.872 --> 15:53.872
 I was confused between light blue and
black.

15:53.872 --> 15:58.864
 I was confused between light blue and
white.

15:59.864 --> 16:01.864
 You look hungry.

16:03.864 --> 16:04.864
 You look cute.

16:05.864 --> 16:07.864
 What's your favorite color?

16:07.864 --> 16:11.864
 My favorite color is white.

16:11.864 --> 16:12.864
 White!

16:13.864 --> 16:15.864
 I was confused between light blue and
white.

16:17.864 --> 16:18.864
 You're right!

16:18.864 --> 16:19.864
 You're amazing!

16:21.864 --> 16:23.864
 You were right when you sang the first
part.

16:24.864 --> 16:25.864
 I was confused between light blue and
white.

16:25.864 --> 16:27.864
 I was confused between light blue and
white.

16:28.864 --> 16:29.864
 I like black, too.

16:30.864 --> 16:31.864
 I like black, too.

16:31.864 --> 16:32.864
 I like white, too.

16:33.864 --> 16:34.864
 You're kind.

16:35.864 --> 16:36.864
 The current score is...

16:36.864 --> 16:46.864
 Nanamin 2, Churiya 3, Hita 1, Hayu 0,
Yuri 1.

16:47.864 --> 16:48.864
 It's tough.

16:50.864 --> 16:52.864
 I'm glad you got the right answer.

16:52.864 --> 16:53.864
 It's tough.

16:53.864 --> 16:54.864
 It's tough.

16:55.864 --> 16:56.864
 Let's do our best from now on.

16:56.864 --> 16:57.864
 Let's do our best!

17:02.170 --> 17:04.170
 I want to get at least one point.

17:04.170 --> 17:06.170
 The next question is...

17:06.170 --> 17:11.170
 What is Aki's fastest time in the 50m
race?

17:11.170 --> 17:12.170
 I've heard of it.

17:12.170 --> 17:14.170
 I've never heard of it.

17:14.170 --> 17:15.170
 I've heard of it.

17:15.170 --> 17:17.170
 What is Kiri?

17:17.170 --> 17:18.170
 I don't know.

17:18.170 --> 17:20.170
 How many seconds did she run?

17:20.170 --> 17:22.170
 I don't remember.

17:23.170 --> 17:25.170
 What grade were you in?

17:25.170 --> 17:26.170
 It depends.

17:26.170 --> 17:28.170
 What grade?

17:28.170 --> 17:31.170
 How many seconds did she run?

17:31.170 --> 17:33.170
 12 seconds.

17:33.170 --> 17:34.170
 12 seconds?

17:34.170 --> 17:35.170
 Yes.

17:35.170 --> 17:38.170
 I don't have a fast image.

17:39.170 --> 17:40.170
 I think I'm the fastest.

17:40.170 --> 17:42.170
 I think so.

17:42.170 --> 17:44.170
 I don't think so.

17:44.170 --> 17:47.170
 Please subscribe to this channel.

17:48.216 --> 17:50.216
 Wait, I'm not wearing a hat.

17:51.216 --> 17:53.216
 I'm wearing a normal hair.

17:55.216 --> 17:57.216
 8.3.

17:58.216 --> 17:59.216
 8.3.

17:59.216 --> 18:01.216
 I'm sorry.

18:03.216 --> 18:05.216
 I can't tell if I wear this.

18:06.216 --> 18:07.216
 I can't tell.

18:10.216 --> 18:12.216
 Please open the bag.

18:12.216 --> 18:14.216
 9.

18:14.682 --> 18:18.682
 What is the fastest time of 50m run of
Maki?

18:18.682 --> 18:21.584
 The fastest.

18:21.584 --> 18:29.584
 But I'm slow, so 8.4 seconds.

18:29.584 --> 18:31.584
 So close!

18:31.584 --> 18:33.584
 So close!

18:33.584 --> 18:35.584
 So close!

18:35.584 --> 18:37.584
 So close!

18:37.584 --> 18:39.584
 No, I'm 8.6 seconds.

18:39.584 --> 18:40.584
 That's fast.

18:40.584 --> 18:41.584
 The fastest.

18:41.584 --> 18:44.584
 So I thought I was a little faster.

18:44.584 --> 18:46.584
 That's how fast I was.

18:46.584 --> 18:47.584
 That's good.

18:47.584 --> 18:49.584
 So close!

18:49.584 --> 18:51.584
 I'm going to be a little slower.

18:51.584 --> 18:53.584
 Can I have two?

18:53.584 --> 18:55.584
 So close!

18:55.584 --> 18:57.584
 I'm sorry.

18:57.584 --> 18:59.584
 It's difficult, so I can't help it.

18:59.584 --> 19:04.584
 Please subscribe to this channel.

19:05.178 --> 19:07.178
 Let's move on to the next one.

19:08.178 --> 19:11.178
 How wide is your favorite mask?

19:12.178 --> 19:14.178
 How wide is it?

19:14.178 --> 19:15.178
 It's normal.

19:15.178 --> 19:16.178
 I think I know.

19:18.178 --> 19:20.178
 I don't know how wide it is.

19:20.178 --> 19:22.178
 Use your hand.

19:24.178 --> 19:26.178
 Stand up.

19:29.178 --> 19:30.178
 I don't know.

19:31.178 --> 19:32.178
 I'm using it now.

19:32.178 --> 19:35.178
 I'm using it now.

19:36.986 --> 19:38.986
 I didn't know the width of the mask was
this small.

19:39.986 --> 19:42.986
 I don't know how many centimeters the
width of the mask is.

19:42.986 --> 19:44.986
 It's better to have up to 1.5 cm.

19:46.986 --> 19:47.986
 It's big.

19:47.986 --> 19:50.986
 It's better to have up to 1.5 cm.

19:50.986 --> 19:51.986
 I don't know.

19:51.986 --> 19:52.986
 I don't know.

19:52.986 --> 19:53.986
 I don't know.

19:53.986 --> 19:54.986
 Wait.

19:54.986 --> 19:55.986
 How much is it?

19:55.986 --> 19:59.986
 Please subscribe to this channel.

20:01.816 --> 20:02.816
 I don't know.

20:02.816 --> 20:04.816
 I wonder if it's this big.

20:04.816 --> 20:06.816
 I don't know.

20:06.816 --> 20:07.816
 It's difficult.

20:07.816 --> 20:10.816
 I don't know the width of the mask.

20:10.816 --> 20:11.816
 Is it this big?

20:11.816 --> 20:12.816
 It's not.

20:12.816 --> 20:14.816
 I don't know.

20:14.832 --> 20:16.832
 The word mask is a very big weapon.

20:17.832 --> 20:19.832
 The score is up.

20:20.832 --> 20:22.832
 The score is 32.

20:24.832 --> 20:25.832
 What?

20:26.832 --> 20:27.832
 What?

20:28.832 --> 20:29.832
 What?

20:30.832 --> 20:31.832
 What is this?

20:32.832 --> 20:33.832
 What is this?

20:34.832 --> 20:36.832
 I know what it is.

20:37.832 --> 20:38.832
 What is this?

20:39.832 --> 20:40.832
 What is this?

20:41.832 --> 20:42.832
 This is bad.

20:42.832 --> 20:43.832
 Why?

20:44.832 --> 20:45.832
 It's a mental attack.

20:46.832 --> 20:47.832
 I'm sorry.

20:50.832 --> 20:51.832
 It's strong.

20:52.832 --> 20:54.832
 It's a mental attack.

20:55.832 --> 20:56.832
 It's a mental attack.

20:58.832 --> 20:59.832
 I'm sorry.

21:07.832 --> 21:08.832
 Next, Ayaka.

21:09.832 --> 21:10.832
 The score is 12.5.

21:10.832 --> 21:11.832
 The score is 10.5.

21:12.832 --> 21:13.832
 The score is 16.5.

21:14.832 --> 21:15.832
 The score is 14.5.

21:16.832 --> 21:17.832
 What?

21:18.832 --> 21:19.832
 Kanami is the best.

21:22.832 --> 21:23.832
 Kanami is the best.

21:23.832 --> 21:24.832
 The score is 11.5.

21:24.832 --> 21:25.832
 The score is 12.5.

21:25.832 --> 21:26.832
 I might be right.

21:30.680 --> 21:34.680
 What is the width of your favorite
mask?

21:34.680 --> 21:37.680
 Can you guess?

21:37.680 --> 21:39.680
 It's 14.5cm.

21:40.680 --> 21:41.680
 I'm so good at it.

21:42.680 --> 21:45.680
 I've been looking up the width of my
favorite mask.

21:47.680 --> 21:52.680
 I think my favorite mask is big.

21:53.680 --> 21:58.680
 So, I looked up the width of my
favorite mask and compared it with the
width of my favorite mask.

21:58.680 --> 22:03.680
 I think this width is good.

22:03.680 --> 22:05.680
 You have other favorite masks, don't
you?

22:06.680 --> 22:09.680
 By the way, the width of my favorite
mask is 9.5cm.

22:10.680 --> 22:11.680
 I'm so good at it.

22:12.680 --> 22:14.680
 You are the best.

22:15.680 --> 22:18.680
 I've been looking up the width of my
favorite mask.

22:19.680 --> 22:20.680
 What is the width of your favorite
mask?

 I think there are various ways, such as
eating it with a laughing face or eating
it with a kinako.

24:16.816 --> 24:18.816
 I eat it as it is.

24:18.816 --> 24:27.816
 I like to eat it with my mouth full of
it.

24:28.816 --> 24:30.816
 It's best.

24:30.816 --> 24:33.816
 It's really the first time I've eaten
it.

24:33.816 --> 24:36.800
 It's amazing, but I like yogurt.

24:37.800 --> 24:38.800

 We all have a delicate taste.

 Very recently.

25:34.786 --> 25:36.786
 What is it?

25:36.786 --> 25:38.786
 It's not here.

25:40.136 --> 25:41.136
 This might be it.

25:43.136 --> 25:44.136
 This was difficult.

25:44.136 --> 25:45.136
 I don't want to answer.

25:45.136 --> 25:48.136
 There are two answers, so if you get
one of them, you can say OK.

25:48.136 --> 25:49.136
 Let's answer one by one.

25:50.136 --> 25:51.136
 Apple.

 Soup stock.

25:58.136 --> 25:59.136
 There was soup stock.

25:59.136 --> 26:00.136
 But it's a roadside.

26:00.136 --> 26:01.136
 Oden.

26:01.136 --> 26:02.136
 Yes, it's a roadside.

26:28.552 --> 26:29.552
 Ramen?

26:29.552 --> 26:30.552
 No, ramen.

26:30.552 --> 26:34.552
 I found a picture of ramen.

26:34.552 --> 26:35.552
 It costs 1,000 yen.

26:39.552 --> 26:40.552
 I can't believe it.

26:40.552 --> 26:42.552
 Don't try to lie.

26:44.552 --> 26:46.552
 Do you put hot water in it?

26:46.552 --> 26:47.552
 No, I don't.

26:48.552 --> 26:49.552
 It's a bag.

26:50.552 --> 26:51.552
 It's like a frozen noodle.

26:53.552 --> 26:54.552
 I didn't know that.

26:55.552 --> 26:56.552
 The last one.

26:56.552 --> 26:57.552
 I'm scared.

26:57.552 --> 26:58.552
 It's a punishment game.

26:58.552 --> 27:00.552
 How many points do you want?

Akari's?

27:05.552 --> 27:06.552

27:08.552 --> 27:09.552
 What is 3%?

27:09.552 --> 27:10.552
 If you get it right, you'll get 3
points.

27:10.552 --> 27:11.552
 3 points?

27:11.552 --> 27:12.552
 2 points is fine.

27:12.552 --> 27:13.552
 2 points is fine.

27:13.552 --> 27:15.552
 I'm trying to be a queen.

27:17.552 --> 27:18.552
 2?

27:18.552 --> 27:19.552

 Yes, the one with the wire.

27:41.458 --> 27:45.458
 I heard the sound of the wire.

27:45.458 --> 27:46.458
 I haven't changed it yet.

27:46.458 --> 27:48.458
 It's broken.

27:54.458 --> 27:56.458

 Your earphone is broken.

29:09.584 --> 29:11.584
 How do you feel about that?

29:11.584 --> 29:13.584
 I said my earphone is broken

29:13.584 --> 29:15.584
 because I can hear the sound of the
earphone.

29:17.584 --> 29:19.584
 How do you think

29:19.584 --> 29:21.584

29:21.584 --> 29:23.584
 Let's think about it.

29:23.584 --> 29:25.584
 I don't know.

29:25.584 --> 29:27.584
 The answer is

29:27.584 --> 29:29.584
 I can't hear the right ear.

29:35.584 --> 29:37.584
 The sound is too small.

29:37.584 --> 29:39.584
 I'll raise the volume.

29:39.584 --> 29:41.584
 I can hear only my left ear.

29:41.584 --> 29:43.584

 I'm happy.

31:09.136 --> 31:10.136
 I'm happy.

31:10.136 --> 31:15.738
 It's a penalty game.

31:15.738 --> 31:17.738
 I'm so happy.

31:17.738 --> 31:19.738
 Please tell me your plans.

31:19.738 --> 31:21.738
 I'll make it myself.

31:21.738 --> 31:23.738
 Why did I say a lot of jokes?

31:23.738 --> 31:25.738

 That's good.

31:27.738 --> 31:29.738
 I'll make everyone like Pokemon.

 I was aiming for the first one.

31:50.298 --> 31:52.298
 I'm so happy.

33:14.298 --> 33:16.298
 She sticks them to everyone.

33:16.298 --> 33:18.298
 She sticks them to everyone.

33:18.298 --> 33:20.298
 She sticks them to everyone.

33:20.298 --> 33:22.298
 I see.

33:22.298 --> 33:24.298
 What kind of power does she have?

33:24.298 --> 33:26.298
 I'm lonely.

33:26.298 --> 33:28.298
 What level does she have?

33:28.298 --> 33:30.298
 She is...

33:30.298 --> 33:32.298
 She is...

33:32.298 --> 33:34.298
 She is...

33:34.298 --> 33:36.298
 She has three eyelashes.

33:36.298 --> 33:38.298
 She has three eyelashes.

33:38.298 --> 33:40.298
 She is cute.

33:40.298 --> 33:42.298
 That's all for today.

33:42.298 --> 33:44.298
 That's all for today.

33:44.298 --> 33:46.298
 We got a lot of information from Aki-
chan.

33:46.298 --> 33:48.298
 We got a lot of information from Aki-
chan.

33:48.298 --> 33:50.298
 I'm sure.

33:50.298 --> 33:52.298
 I'm surprised that so many of us got
the right answer.

33:52.298 --> 33:54.298
 I'm surprised that so many of us got
the right answer.

33:54.298 --> 33:56.298
 I thought it was a small number.

33:56.298 --> 33:58.298
 It's not that difficult.

33:58.298 --> 34:00.298
 There were a lot of information that we
didn't know.

34:00.298 --> 34:02.298
 There were a lot of information that we
didn't know.

34:02.298 --> 34:04.298
 It was a great job.

34:04.298 --> 34:06.298
 It was a great job.

34:06.298 --> 34:09.056
 Please subscribe to our channel.

34:10.056 --> 34:12.056
 We'll do it one more time.

34:12.056 --> 34:14.056
 We'll do it once.

34:14.056 --> 34:18.056
 I want to do it with a more difficult
problem.

34:21.376 --> 34:23.376
 Thank you for watching.

34:23.376 --> 34:25.376
 Thank you.

34:25.376 --> 34:28.376
 If you want to know more about Aki,

34:28.376 --> 34:30.376
 or if you want to go to a restaurant,

34:30.376 --> 34:32.376
 please subscribe to our channel.

34:32.376 --> 34:33.376
 What?

34:33.376 --> 34:34.376
 What are you writing?

34:34.376 --> 34:35.376
 I was writing something.

34:35.376 --> 34:37.376
 I was writing something.

34:38.376 --> 34:40.376
 I was told the name of Pokemon,

34:40.376 --> 34:42.376
 but that's all I could think of.

34:43.376 --> 34:47.376
 And Tokiwaro has a new year special.

34:47.376 --> 34:48.376
 New year's day?

34:48.376 --> 34:54.376
 I don't know if there's a video of it,
but I think there is.

34:54.376 --> 34:55.376
 Maybe?

34:55.376 --> 34:56.376
 Maybe not?

34:56.376 --> 34:57.376
 Maybe there is.

34:57.376 --> 34:59.376
 Maybe it will be on the video.

34:59.376 --> 35:00.376
 Right?

35:00.376 --> 35:04.376
 Maybe we will be on the video.

35:06.376 --> 35:08.376
 Maybe there is something.

35:08.376 --> 35:09.376
 Maybe?

35:09.376 --> 35:10.376
 Maybe?

35:10.376 --> 35:12.376
 I don't know.

35:12.376 --> 35:17.376
 Please watch us a lot from the new
year.

35:17.376 --> 35:18.376
 Please.

35:19.376 --> 35:20.376
 Then,

35:20.376 --> 35:21.376
 lock on to your heart.

35:21.376 --> 35:22.376
 We are

35:22.376 --> 35:24.376
 Jyoutokimusi.

35:24.376 --> 35:26.376
 Bye-bye.

35:26.376 --> 35:28.376
 Thank you for watching.

35:28.376 --> 35:29.376
 Thank you.

35:29.376 --> 35:31.376
 Bye-bye.

35:31.376 --> 35:32.376
 Bye-bye.

35:32.376 --> 35:33.376
 Last one.

35:33.376 --> 35:34.376
 Please.

35:34.376 --> 35:35.376
 Please.

35:35.376 --> 35:36.376
 Please.

35:36.376 --> 35:37.376
 Please.

35:37.376 --> 35:38.376
 Sorry.

35:38.376 --> 35:42.496
 We have a cool last one.

35:43.496 --> 35:46.496
 Good bye, goodbye, to me of yesterday.

35:47.496 --> 35:50.496
 The city lights are sparkling.

35:51.496 --> 35:52.496
 My heart is like a sunny day.

35:53.496 --> 35:54.496
 I make a sound in the puddle.

35:54.496 --> 35:56.570
 I'm a rainbow piano.

36:07.386 --> 36:15.386
 I wonder why, when I smile, the world
seems to shine

36:15.386 --> 36:19.386
 I can turn my umbrella and feel relaxed

36:19.386 --> 36:23.386
 If I don't, I can't walk

36:23.386 --> 36:26.386
 I'm sure someone is crying somewhere

36:26.386 --> 36:31.386
 I wonder if I'll get wet and cold again
somewhere

36:31.386 --> 36:34.386
 I'm sure someone is crying somewhere

36:34.386 --> 36:35.472
 I'm sure someone is crying somewhere

36:35.472 --> 36:40.472
 I want to share my feelings with you

36:40.472 --> 36:44.472
 There's still a view I've never seen
before

36:44.472 --> 36:49.472
 Let's go anywhere

36:51.304 --> 36:53.304
 Goodbye, goodbye

36:53.304 --> 36:55.304
 Thank you for yesterday

36:55.304 --> 36:59.304
 The city after the rain is colorful

36:59.304 --> 37:01.304
 I draw a fragment of the future

37:01.304 --> 37:03.304
 on the canvas of my damaged heart

37:03.304 --> 37:21.304
 It will guide me

37:21.466 --> 37:24.466
 Subbed by Dreadopp and Zedopp.

37:58.778 --> 38:01.438
 Goodbye to me of yesterday

38:01.438 --> 38:05.518
 The city after the rain is sparkling

38:05.518 --> 38:07.718
 My heart is like a flower

38:07.718 --> 38:09.718
 I cry and cry

38:09.718 --> 38:29.398
 I wear a rainbow dress
