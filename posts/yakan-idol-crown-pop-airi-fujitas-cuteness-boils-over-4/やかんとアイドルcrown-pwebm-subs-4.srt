1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Yakan and idol

2
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:12,000
I really like people

3
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:16,000
I really like talking to people

4
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:19,000
That's why I'm doing a lot of live
streams

5
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:24,000
But I have one goal in my life

6
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000
Can I announce it?

7
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,000
Is it okay?

8
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:31,000
I've said this before

9
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:36,000
I want to meet as many people as
possible

10
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:43,000
I want to spend time with people

11
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:46,000
Why is that?

12
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:49,000
Is it important to meet?

13
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:54,000
There are many things that you don't
know if you don't meet

14
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:58,000
I think I don't know much more if I
don't meet

15
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:03,000
I want to meet and talk about what I can
do

16
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:12,000
I think I can talk to people and make a
relationship with them

17
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:16,000
That's probably my life

18
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
I think that's a job I can do

19
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:21,000
You're really a manager

20
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:25,000
That's right

21
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:27,000
That's great

22
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:33,000
I feel grateful to meet people

23
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:40,000
I think it's only idols that can't do
anything but wait

24
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:45,000
There are people who can't come to see
me

25
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:53,000
I want people to laugh at me

26
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:57,000
I want people to think of me

27
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:02,000
I'm happy when I'm happy

28
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
I want to meet

29
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:08,000
I want you to come to see me

30
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:13,000
I don't think anyone should come to see
me

31
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:16,000
I see

32
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:21,000
I'm thinking about three things that
fans think

33
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,000
You were listening

34
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,000
Yes

35
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:37,000
You're cute and sensitive

36
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:42,000
You're kind and sweet

37
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:46,000
Everyone thinks I'm sweet

38
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:49,000
You're beautiful

39
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:52,000
You're beautiful

40
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:55,000
You're beautiful

41
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:58,000
You're beautiful and cute

42
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:05,000
You're sharing with fans

43
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:09,000
I'm too much of a delivery

44
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:15,000
I'm not a bad person

45
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,000
You're a money-saving person

46
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,000
What is that?

47
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,000
You're a person who's into money

48
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,000
Please stop

49
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,000
I don't accept that

50
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,000
You don't accept that

51
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:31,000
I can only talk to MCs

52
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,000
In a group

53
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:39,000
I want to talk to people

54
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:45,000
I can't show everyone who I am

55
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,000
You want to show everyone?

56
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,000
Yes

57
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:53,000
I want people to know

58
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:57,000
I want to share

59
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:01,000
You want to share Fujita Aeri?

60
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:04,000
We want to share folder games

61
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,000
I see

62
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:13,000
I want to see cute clappos

63
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,000
You want to see cute reporters?

64
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:31,000
I want to see cute reporters
