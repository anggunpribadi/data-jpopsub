1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
I made the bento from scratch.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:09,000
I made the one with the side dishes.

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:12,000
I think you'll want to eat it right
away.

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:13,000
I'll eat one by one.

5
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:18,000
If I hadn't done the chair dance, I
wouldn't be here.

6
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:24,000
If I hadn't done the chair dance, it
would have been difficult.

7
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000
I'm impressed by your skills.

8
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:29,000
I want you to eat it.

9
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
Yakan and Idol

10
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:41,000
One day, Yakan, who was sleeping in the
living room of the Star Dust
headquarters, showed up.

11
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:44,000
His name is Yakan.

12
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:51,000
Yakan, who is interested in idols, will
make delicious tea for the people of
Star Dust.

13
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Please let me talk to the idols.

14
00:00:54,000 --> 00:01:00,000
The people of Star Dust who are kind and
tea-loving are okay.

15
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:09,000
Yakan, who was born in the dormitory,
was born as an idol.

16
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:16,000
Today, we have Yakan, who grew up in the
dormitory of Viva Home.

17
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:19,000
Let's get started.

18
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:22,000
Let's call today's guest.

19
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
This is an idol.

20
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:27,000
I'm Chihho Takaichi from BOLT.

21
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,000
Nice to meet you.

22
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:34,000
I got a call from BOLT.

23
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
Yakan, please.

24
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Thank you.

25
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:42,000
I feel like talking to Yakan today.

26
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
This is my first experience.

27
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Thank you.

28
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:46,000
I got my first experience.

29
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:53,000
Mr. Takaichi, I think you have your
favorite autumn.

30
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:54,000
I love it.

31
00:01:54,000 --> 00:02:01,000
I heard that you are familiar with
drawing artistic illustrations.

32
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Really?

33
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:09,000
I made my art debut in this autumn.

34
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,000
What is your art debut?

35
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:19,000
I sell my original digital art.

36
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:22,000
Did you have a picture book?

37
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,000
Yes.

38
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,000
Really?

39
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,000
I'm sorry.

40
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Have you finished drawing?

41
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,000
Yes.

42
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,000
Please put me in the inn.

43
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:37,000
Yakan, can I come in?

44
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,000
I don't think so.

45
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,000
I think so.

46
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,000
I don't think so.

47
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,000
Can I draw Yakan?

48
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,000
You can draw Yakan.

49
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,000
Can I draw now?

50
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,000
Now.

51
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:53,000
You are doing NFT here.

52
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:58,000
Everyone was taking a cute picture.

53
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,000
Do you like Yakan?

54
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,000
I like Yakan.

55
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,000
Are you happy?

56
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
Please draw Yakan while talking.

57
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
Will you go away?

58
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:09,000
I'm the type to finish drawing quickly.

59
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,000
Please go away.

60
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:14,000
Please go away.

61
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:19,000
What do you care about when you draw me?

62
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:23,000
It's important not to think.

63
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:26,000
I'm worried.

64
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:30,000
I don't care about drafts.

65
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
I don't care about drafts.

66
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:35,000
Yakan and IDOL.

67
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:38,000
I finished drawing Yakan.

68
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:41,000
Please introduce yourself.

69
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:44,000
This is Yakan.

70
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:48,000
This is Yakan.

71
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:57,000
I can imagine the atmosphere of Yakan.

72
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,000
I don't know.

73
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Is this a 30-piece work?

74
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:03,000
Yes.

75
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,000
I don't know.

76
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:08,000
Each artist has his own way of drawing.

77
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:12,000
Thank you for drawing me.

78
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
I will give you a present.

79
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:17,000
I will give you a present.

80
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:21,000
I was glad that I was doing a cheer
after receiving a present.

81
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:27,000
I was told that it would have been
difficult if I hadn't done it.

82
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,000
I was told.

83
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:32,000
I was told that it was because of the
cheer.

84
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
Thank you for watching.
