1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Ebichu's videos, etc.

Please subscribe to my channel!

3
00:00:34,074 --> 00:00:37,894
I don't steal fruits

4
00:00:37,894 --> 00:00:41,814
I'm not lying

5
00:00:41,814 --> 00:00:46,294
I'm not really good at eating fruits

6
00:00:46,294 --> 00:00:48,874
so I don't steal them

7
00:00:48,874 --> 00:00:54,094
I do get them at the school cafeteria

8
00:00:54,094 --> 00:00:56,814
but I don't eat them that much

9
00:00:56,814 --> 00:01:01,434
I only eat pineapple and apple

10
00:01:01,434 --> 00:01:04,314
I don't steal fruits

11
00:01:04,464 --> 00:01:08,144
I'm not lying, I don't lie

12
00:01:08,144 --> 00:01:12,944
even if I do, it's a small lie

13
00:01:12,944 --> 00:01:14,944
like the April Fool's joke

14
00:01:14,944 --> 00:01:16,944
I fought with my friends

15
00:01:16,944 --> 00:01:18,944
I broke something

16
00:01:18,944 --> 00:01:22,264
even if it's a small lie

17
00:01:22,264 --> 00:01:26,984
like a lie to surprise a friend

18
00:01:26,984 --> 00:01:33,424
I tell them that I'm with someone

19
00:01:33,424 --> 00:01:33,472
I'm not lying, I'm not lying

20
00:01:33,472 --> 00:01:35,472
my friend was surprised

21
00:01:35,472 --> 00:01:37,472
and he surprised me

22
00:01:37,472 --> 00:01:39,472
but it wasn't a person

23
00:01:39,472 --> 00:01:41,472
it was a sign

24
00:01:41,472 --> 00:01:43,472
that you see in the streets

25
00:01:43,472 --> 00:01:45,472
like this

26
00:01:45,472 --> 00:01:47,472
a sign for a boy who's about to jump out
of a car

27
00:01:47,472 --> 00:01:49,472
that's what it was

28
00:01:49,472 --> 00:01:51,472
I can only lie about that

29
00:01:51,472 --> 00:01:53,472
I can't lie about

30
00:01:53,472 --> 00:01:55,472
not stealing

31
00:01:55,472 --> 00:01:57,472
I can't lie about that

32
00:01:59,472 --> 00:02:01,472
I know who's the one who's about to eat
it

33
00:02:01,472 --> 00:02:02,432
but

34
00:02:02,692 --> 00:02:04,692
It's not me

35
00:02:04,692 --> 00:02:06,692
I want you to believe me, please

36
00:02:11,052 --> 00:02:15,052
First of all, the fruits that were
stolen

37
00:02:15,052 --> 00:02:19,052
I don't know where they were stored

38
00:02:19,052 --> 00:02:21,052
I'm not good at fruits

39
00:02:23,052 --> 00:02:26,052
The last person who left the store?

40
00:02:26,052 --> 00:02:28,052
Who is it?

41
00:02:28,052 --> 00:02:31,376
It wasn't me who left last

42
00:02:31,376 --> 00:02:38,056
When I left, there was a girl who said
bye bye

43
00:02:38,056 --> 00:02:43,536
I'm still suspicious

44
00:02:43,536 --> 00:02:46,656
Is it a lie? I'm not lying

45
00:02:46,656 --> 00:02:48,656
I've been lying so far

46
00:02:48,656 --> 00:02:59,776
When I was in elementary school, I told
a girl that the right angle is a two-
sided triangle

47
00:02:59,776 --> 00:02:59,840
I'm still suspicious

48
00:03:00,840 --> 00:03:07,840
I was going to tease her, but I really
believed it, and I was scolded by the
teacher.

49
00:03:08,840 --> 00:03:10,840
I'm apologizing for that.

50
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:23,840
I've been told a lot of lies, but I
don't lie that often at this age.

51
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:27,840
I'm sorry.

52
00:03:29,048 --> 00:03:37,048
I like fruits, but I don't think I'll
steal it because I'll probably eat it.

53
00:03:39,048 --> 00:03:43,048
Isn't that the chief manager's
principal?

54
00:03:43,048 --> 00:03:45,048
I don't think so.

55
00:03:45,048 --> 00:03:47,048
No, I'm not.

56
00:03:47,048 --> 00:03:49,048
I didn't steal it.

57
00:03:52,048 --> 00:03:54,720
Is this a high-priced fruit?

58
00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:59,280
I don't steal. Is there anyone who
steals such fruit?

59
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:09,360
I was watching it because I thought it
was kept carefully, but at that time I
was so hungry that I went out of the
dressing room to get some food.

60
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:16,680
I don't know if anyone was in the
dressing room during that time, but when
I came back, I wonder if there was.

61
00:04:16,680 --> 00:04:24,256
I haven't seen it since then. I've been
in the dressing room since then. I was
looking at the origami.

62
00:04:25,256 --> 00:04:31,256
I've been doing shuriken lately.

63
00:04:31,256 --> 00:04:34,256
I've been into origami for a long time.

64
00:04:36,256 --> 00:04:45,256
I eat fruits when I'm in the dressing
room, but I don't touch them at first.

65
00:04:45,256 --> 00:04:50,256
I eat them when I think everyone is
starting to eat.

66
00:04:50,256 --> 00:04:53,888
I eat them when I have my favorite.

67
00:04:54,888 --> 00:04:56,888
Can I go home now?

68
00:04:56,888 --> 00:04:58,888
I'm waiting for someone outside.

69
00:04:58,888 --> 00:05:00,888
I'm waiting for Tokugawa Iyasu.

70
00:05:00,888 --> 00:05:05,888
I'm afraid I'll be scolded if I keep
waiting for him.

71
00:05:07,888 --> 00:05:11,888
Anyway, I'm not stealing anything.

72
00:05:11,888 --> 00:05:12,888
Never.

73
00:05:12,888 --> 00:05:17,786
To be continued.

74
00:05:17,786 --> 00:05:23,786
I've heard rumors, but it's not me.

75
00:05:23,786 --> 00:05:26,786
No, it's not me.

76
00:05:26,786 --> 00:05:28,786
Really.

77
00:05:28,786 --> 00:05:32,786
I don't lie much.

78
00:05:34,786 --> 00:05:40,786
For example, if I ate Fujii's cooking,

79
00:05:40,786 --> 00:05:43,786
I'd better show this to Fujii.

80
00:05:43,786 --> 00:05:44,544
Well, yesterday I was eating Fujii's
cuisine...

81
00:05:45,544 --> 00:05:47,544
I'm the type who can't lie.

82
00:05:48,544 --> 00:05:50,544
I'm not kidding.

83
00:05:51,544 --> 00:05:53,544
I don't lie that much.

84
00:05:57,544 --> 00:05:59,544
Is it a suspicious person?

85
00:06:02,544 --> 00:06:06,544
I was talking about this incident with
the members the other day.

86
00:06:06,544 --> 00:06:10,720
Miria just avoids the story of it.

87
00:06:11,720 --> 00:06:20,720
I'm not sure about the law of Fleming or
the law of Le Chatelier's parallel
movement.

88
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:24,720
That's about it.

89
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:31,720
I'm sorry. I don't have much information
that can help.

90
00:06:31,720 --> 00:06:37,720
Thank you very much.

91
00:06:39,400 --> 00:06:41,400
What? In the dressing room?

92
00:06:41,400 --> 00:06:43,400
Are you a thief?

93
00:06:46,752 --> 00:06:52,352
Hey, say no, monster! Your immortal is
important!

94
00:06:52,352 --> 00:06:56,952
I'll tell you more and more, the crime
of teaching!

95
00:06:56,952 --> 00:07:01,152
I don't know what kind of person you
are!

96
00:07:01,152 --> 00:07:05,352
I'm not a mountain!

97
00:07:05,352 --> 00:07:07,752
Do you know what song I was singing?

98
00:07:07,752 --> 00:07:11,952
I was singing a song at the rent of
Ebichu's love.

99
00:07:11,952 --> 00:07:17,352
I've been singing and talking about it
lately.

100
00:07:17,352 --> 00:07:19,952
I'm addicted.

101
00:07:19,952 --> 00:07:22,752
Don't be kidding me, talk to me!

102
00:07:22,752 --> 00:07:25,200
Horiamen

103
00:07:26,200 --> 00:07:28,200
That's what it is.

104
00:07:28,200 --> 00:07:31,200
I'll talk to you.

105
00:07:31,200 --> 00:07:35,200
Well, Mayama is...

106
00:07:35,792 --> 00:07:38,992
I think I was eating at a catering.

107
00:07:38,992 --> 00:07:52,792
Yeah, it's pretty late to eat, so I went
to a catering with everyone as usual,
but I ate and ate, and before I knew it,
everyone had gone home first, so I
didn't go into the dressing room in the
first place.

108
00:07:52,792 --> 00:07:55,792
So I don't think it's me.

109
00:07:55,792 --> 00:08:06,792
And after eating, I did half-naked
jumping and training, so I think it's
different. Can you guess the other one?

110
00:08:09,914 --> 00:08:13,914
I really wanted to eat that.

111
00:08:13,914 --> 00:08:16,914
And that's really expensive.

112
00:08:16,914 --> 00:08:18,914
Right?

113
00:08:18,914 --> 00:08:26,640
It's hard to say, but I ate too much in
the morning.

114
00:08:27,640 --> 00:08:32,640
I'm really frustrated that I'm calling
myself a fruit monster.

115
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:40,640
I made a mistake in the morning when I
was in front of the fruit.

116
00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:43,640
I'm sorry for my own fault.

117
00:08:43,640 --> 00:08:51,640
I'm going to sing this frustration.

118
00:08:51,640 --> 00:08:53,640
Can you listen to it?

119
00:08:53,640 --> 00:08:54,368
I'm sorry.

120
00:08:55,368 --> 00:09:01,368
If you listen to this song, you'll be
able to be sure that I'm not the
culprit.

121
00:09:01,368 --> 00:09:03,368
I'm going to sing.

122
00:09:03,368 --> 00:09:08,576
I'm sorry I couldn't eat the fruit.

123
00:09:09,576 --> 00:09:23,576
I thought that the first line of the
national road that continues forever was
a dark dead end.

124
00:09:24,576 --> 00:09:31,576
Curry and ramen gyudon from the morning.

125
00:09:31,576 --> 00:09:39,576
I ate too much fruit monster.

126
00:09:42,074 --> 00:09:47,874
It's like this, but I hope you'll
believe me.

127
00:09:47,874 --> 00:09:49,874
I'm going to do my best.

128
00:09:49,874 --> 00:09:54,874
I'm going to do my best.

129
00:09:54,874 --> 00:09:59,034
My stay word was Tobidashi Boya.

130
00:09:59,034 --> 00:10:04,034
My designated word was the right angle
two-sided triangle.

131
00:10:05,034 --> 00:10:11,034
My designated word was Tokugawa Ieyasu.
Did you get it?

132
00:10:13,034 --> 00:10:17,034
My designated word was Fujii's homemade
food.

133
00:10:17,034 --> 00:10:20,034
Fujii's fried chicken is delicious.

134
00:10:21,034 --> 00:10:26,034
My designated word was Heisei's monster.
Did you get it?

135
00:10:26,034 --> 00:10:34,034
My designated word was the national road
1 line. Did you get it?

136
00:10:35,640 --> 00:10:40,640
You put it on while walking A, B, C, D.

137
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:45,640
Open your mouth big!

138
00:10:45,640 --> 00:10:46,522
Yes.

139
00:10:46,522 --> 00:10:48,522
It's me.

140
00:10:49,856 --> 00:10:51,856
Was my acting suspicious?

141
00:10:51,856 --> 00:10:58,856
I don't think I would say the rule of
the parallel movement of Le Chatelier.

142
00:10:58,856 --> 00:11:04,856
I don't think I would say it in my usual
way, and I didn't know this word.

143
00:11:04,856 --> 00:11:11,856
But thanks to that, the probability of
correct answer of Yasumoto's designated
word was low.

144
00:11:11,856 --> 00:11:15,856
This is my victory.

145
00:11:15,856 --> 00:11:19,856
Thank you for watching.

146
00:11:19,962 --> 00:11:21,962
Oh, my.

147
00:11:21,962 --> 00:11:22,962
Oh, my.

148
00:11:22,962 --> 00:11:24,962
I'm sorry.

149
00:11:24,962 --> 00:11:26,962
Did I do too much?

150
00:11:26,962 --> 00:11:30,962
So, I'd like to apologize.

151
00:11:30,962 --> 00:11:44,121
I'm thinking about what I can do for the
next project.
