00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Ebichu's videos

2
00:00:15,898 --> 00:00:19,898
So we should choose a girl who looks
like 117?

3
00:00:19,898 --> 00:00:23,898
117 is Aki's birthday.

4
00:00:23,898 --> 00:00:26,898
If you say that, everyone will look like
117.

5
00:00:26,898 --> 00:00:29,898
This is a momentum.

6
00:00:29,898 --> 00:00:35,898
Cheers!

7
00:00:35,898 --> 00:00:41,898
To be continued.

8
00:00:43,320 --> 00:00:45,320
Congratulations!

9
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:49,320
I'm glad to hear that.

10
00:00:49,320 --> 00:00:52,320
Let's celebrate.

11
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:54,320
Congratulations!

12
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:57,320
I finally got it right.

13
00:00:57,320 --> 00:00:59,320
I'm so happy.

14
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:02,320
Don't be a judge.

15
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:04,320
I finally got it right.

16
00:01:04,320 --> 00:01:06,320
I'm so happy.

17
00:01:06,320 --> 00:01:08,320
I'm so happy.

18
00:01:08,320 --> 00:01:08,858
I'm so happy.

19
00:01:08,858 --> 00:01:10,858
I don't know.

20
00:01:10,858 --> 00:01:12,858
What was it?

21
00:01:12,858 --> 00:01:14,858
I remember only the last one.

22
00:01:14,858 --> 00:01:16,858
What was it?

23
00:01:18,858 --> 00:01:20,858
Is it right?

24
00:01:20,858 --> 00:01:22,858
The principal is right.

25
00:01:22,858 --> 00:01:24,858
There are many problems.

26
00:01:26,858 --> 00:01:28,858
I don't know.

27
00:01:28,858 --> 00:01:30,858
I don't know.

28
00:01:30,858 --> 00:01:34,858
I'm sorry, principal.

29
00:01:36,328 --> 00:01:40,328
I'm sorry I couldn't hit you even though
I was sticking out.

30
00:01:40,328 --> 00:01:42,328
I'm sorry.

31
00:01:47,328 --> 00:01:49,328
Oh, that's what it is.

32
00:01:49,328 --> 00:01:51,328
What are you saying, Yuka?

33
00:01:51,328 --> 00:01:54,328
I don't know. I don't know. I'm not
going to write my name.

34
00:01:54,328 --> 00:01:56,328
It's like a tataguchi.

35
00:01:56,328 --> 00:01:58,328
No, it's not.

36
00:01:58,328 --> 00:02:01,328
I'm sorry.

37
00:02:05,114 --> 00:02:07,114
I got it!

38
00:02:07,114 --> 00:02:09,114
I got it!

39
00:02:09,114 --> 00:02:11,114
I got it!

40
00:02:11,114 --> 00:02:13,114
Wow!

41
00:02:13,114 --> 00:02:15,114
I got it!

42
00:02:15,114 --> 00:02:17,114
I got it!

43
00:02:17,114 --> 00:02:19,114
I got it!

44
00:02:19,114 --> 00:02:21,114
I got it!

45
00:02:21,114 --> 00:02:23,114
I see.

46
00:02:25,114 --> 00:02:27,114
I want to avoid minus points.

47
00:02:27,114 --> 00:02:29,114
I see.

48
00:02:29,114 --> 00:02:31,114
I see.

49
00:02:31,114 --> 00:02:32,698
I see.

50
00:02:32,698 --> 00:02:34,698
I'm sorry.

51
00:02:34,698 --> 00:02:36,698
I'm sorry again.

52
00:02:36,698 --> 00:02:38,698
I'm sorry again.

53
00:02:40,698 --> 00:02:42,698
I'm sorry.

54
00:02:44,698 --> 00:02:46,698
I'm sorry.

55
00:02:46,698 --> 00:02:48,698
OK.

56
00:02:50,698 --> 00:02:52,698
I think this is the right kanji.

57
00:02:52,698 --> 00:02:54,698
I'm sorry again.

58
00:03:01,466 --> 00:03:03,466
Yeah!

59
00:03:03,466 --> 00:03:05,466
I did it!

60
00:03:05,466 --> 00:03:07,466
I made a mistake.

61
00:03:07,466 --> 00:03:09,466
I made a mistake.

62
00:03:09,466 --> 00:03:11,466
It's a very fast.

63
00:03:11,466 --> 00:03:13,466
It's a DNA.

64
00:03:13,466 --> 00:03:15,466
It's Yokohama DNA.

65
00:03:15,466 --> 00:03:17,466
It's a small letter.

66
00:03:17,466 --> 00:03:19,466
Oh, yeah.

67
00:03:19,466 --> 00:03:21,466
Please remember.

68
00:03:21,466 --> 00:03:23,466
I see.

69
00:03:23,466 --> 00:03:25,466
I did it!

70
00:03:25,466 --> 00:03:27,466
Wow!

71
00:03:27,466 --> 00:03:29,466
It's amazing.

72
00:03:29,466 --> 00:03:31,466
I did it!

73
00:03:31,866 --> 00:03:33,866
What?

74
00:03:33,866 --> 00:03:35,866
How long?

75
00:03:35,866 --> 00:03:37,866
The second longest song?

76
00:03:37,866 --> 00:03:40,866
I think it's about 8 minutes?

77
00:03:40,866 --> 00:03:41,866
7 minutes?

78
00:03:41,866 --> 00:03:43,866
I think it's about 7 minutes.

79
00:03:43,866 --> 00:03:45,866
I don't know.

80
00:03:45,866 --> 00:03:48,784
I think it's about 8 minutes.

81
00:03:49,784 --> 00:03:51,784
I don't know.

82
00:03:51,784 --> 00:03:53,784
Maybe this.

83
00:03:53,784 --> 00:03:55,784
I don't know at all.

84
00:03:57,784 --> 00:03:59,784
Wait a minute.

85
00:03:59,784 --> 00:04:01,784
Something close to 8 minutes.

86
00:04:01,784 --> 00:04:03,784
Is it a long song?

87
00:04:03,784 --> 00:04:05,784
No, it's not long.

88
00:04:05,784 --> 00:04:07,784
This is not long.

89
00:04:07,784 --> 00:04:09,784
It's not long.

90
00:04:09,784 --> 00:04:11,784
I don't know.

91
00:04:11,784 --> 00:04:13,784
I don't know the length of the feeling.

92
00:04:13,784 --> 00:04:15,784
I don't know the feeling.

93
00:04:15,784 --> 00:04:17,784
Wait a minute.

94
00:04:17,784 --> 00:04:19,784
I don't know.

95
00:04:19,784 --> 00:04:21,784
This is not an official practice.

96
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:25,600
It's not an official practice.

97
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:26,600
It's not.

98
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:28,600
I think it's not.

99
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:34,600
Wow!

100
00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:35,600
Great!

101
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:36,600
Great!

102
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:38,600
Great!

103
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:39,600
Great!

104
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:42,720
Mom, I did it!

105
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:44,720
Mom!

106
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:48,720
Wow!

107
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:50,720
It's difficult to answer all of them.

108
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:52,720
All of them are difficult.

109
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:54,720
All of them are difficult.

110
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:58,720
It's impossible if the ratio of the
shrimp is not high.

111
00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:00,720
It's a difficult question.

112
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:02,720
The answer is...

113
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:14,720
Answer James's, answer yourself!
